minchin lived  london her home   large dull tall one   large dull square where all  houses  alike  all  sparrows  alike  where all  doorknockers made  same heavy sound   still daysand nearly all  days  stillseemed  resound through  entire row  which  knock  knocked on miss minchins door there   brass plate on  brass plate there  inscribed  black letters miss minchins select seminary for young ladies little sara crewe never went  or out   house without reading  doorplate  reflecting upon it by  time she  twelve she had decided  all her trouble arose because   first place she  not “select”    second she  not  “young lady” when she  eight years old she had been brought  miss minchin   pupil  left  her her papa had brought her all  way  india her mamma had died when she   baby  her papa had kept her  him  long   could and then finding  hot climate  making her very delicate  had brought her  england  left her  miss minchin   part   select seminary  young ladies sara who had always been  sharp little child who remembered things recollected hearing him say   had not  relative   world whom  knew of  so   obliged  place her   boardingschool   had heard miss minchins establishment spoken  very highly the same day  took sara out  bought her  great many beautiful clothesclothes so grand  rich  only  very young  inexperienced man would have bought them   mite   child who    brought up   boardingschool but  fact      rash innocent young man  very sad   thought  parting  his little girl who  all  had left  remind him  her beautiful mother whom  had dearly loved and  wished her  have everything  most fortunate little girl could have  so when  polite saleswomen   shops said “here  our very latest thing  hats  plumes  exactly  same  those we sold  lady diana sinclair yesterday”  immediately bought what  offered  him  paid whatever  asked the consequence   sara had  most extraordinary wardrobe her dresses  silk  velvet  india cashmere her hats  bonnets  covered  bows  plumes her small undergarments  adorned  real lace  she returned   cab  miss minchins   doll almost  large  herself dressed quite  grandly  herself too then her papa gave miss minchin some money  went away   several days sara would neither touch  doll nor her breakfast nor her dinner nor her tea  would do nothing but crouch   small corner   window  cry she cried so much indeed  she made herself ill she   queer little child  oldfashioned ways  strong feelings  she had adored her papa  could not  made  think  india   interesting bungalow  not better  her than london  miss minchins select seminary the instant she had entered  house she had begun promptly  hate miss minchin   think little  miss amelia minchin who  smooth  dumpy  lisped   evidently afraid  her older sister miss minchin  tall  had large cold fishy eyes  large cold hands which seemed fishy too because they  damp  made chills run down saras back when they touched her  miss minchin pushed her hair off her forehead  said “a most beautiful  promising little girl captain crewe she    favorite pupil quite  favorite pupil i see” for  first year she   favorite pupil  least she  indulged  great deal more than  good  her and when  select seminary went walking two  two she  always decked out  her grandest clothes  led   hand   head   genteel procession  miss minchin herself and when  parents  any   pupils came she  always dressed  called into  parlor  her doll  she used  hear miss minchin say  her father   distinguished indian officer  she would  heiress   great fortune that her father had inherited  great deal  money sara had heard before  also  some day  would  hers    would not remain long   army but would come  live  london and every time  letter came she hoped  would say   coming  they   live together again but about  middle   third year  letter came bringing very different news because   not  business man himself her papa had given his affairs into  hands   friend  trusted the friend had deceived  robbed him all  money  gone no one knew exactly where   shock  so great   poor rash young officer that being attacked  jungle fever shortly afterward  had no strength  rally  so died leaving sara  no one  take care  her miss minchins cold  fishy eyes had never looked so cold  fishy  they did when sara went into  parlor  being sent for  few days after  letter  received no one had said anything   child about mourning so  her oldfashioned way she had decided  find  black dress  herself  had picked out  black velvet she had outgrown  came into  room  it looking  queerest little figure   world   sad little figure too the dress  too short  too tight her face  white her eyes had dark rings around them  her doll wrapped   piece  old black crape  held under her arm she  not  pretty child she  thin  had  weird interesting little face short black hair  very large greengray eyes fringed all around  heavy black lashes “i am  ugliest child   school” she had said once after staring  herself   glass  some minutes but there had been  clever goodnatured little french teacher who had said   musicmaster “zat leetle crewe vat  child a so ogly beauty ze so large eyes ze so little spirituelle face waid till she grow up you shall see” this morning however   tight small black frock she looked thinner  odder than ever  her eyes  fixed  miss minchin   queer steadiness  she slowly advanced into  parlor clutching her doll “put your doll down” said miss minchin “no” said  child “i wont put her down i want her  me she  all i have she  stayed  me all  time since my papa died” she had never been  obedient child she had had her own way ever since she  born  there  about her  air  silent determination under which miss minchin had always felt secretly uncomfortable and  lady felt even now  perhaps  would   well not  insist  her point so she looked  her  severely  possible “you  have no time  dolls  future” she said “you  have  work  improve yourself  make yourself useful” sara kept  big odd eyes fixed  her teacher  said nothing “everything   very different now” miss minchin went on “i sent  you  talk  you  make you understand your father  dead you have no friends you have no money you have no home  no one  take care  you” the little pale olive face twitched nervously but  greengray eyes did not move  miss minchins  still sara said nothing “what  you staring at” demanded miss minchin sharply “are you so stupid you dont understand what i mean i tell you  you  quite alone   world  have no one  do anything  you unless i choose  keep you here” the truth was miss minchin   her worst mood to  suddenly deprived   large sum  money yearly   show pupil   find herself   little beggar  her hands  more than she could bear  any degree  calmness “now listen  me” she went on “and remember what i say if you work hard  prepare  make yourself useful   few years i shall let you stay here you  only  child but you   sharp child  you pick up things almost without being taught you speak french very well    year or so you can begin  help   younger pupils by  time you  fifteen you ought   able  do  much  least” “i can speak french better than you now” said sara “i always spoke   my papa  india” which  not  all polite but  painfully true because miss minchin could not speak french  all and indeed  not   least  clever person but she   hard grasping business woman and after  first shock  disappointment had seen   very little expense  herself she might prepare this clever determined child   very useful  her  save her  necessity  paying large salaries  teachers  languages “dont  impudent or you   punished” she said “you  have  improve your manners if you expect  earn your bread you  not  parlor boarder now remember  if you dont please me  i send you away you have no home but  street you can go now” sara turned away “stay” commanded miss minchin “dont you intend  thank me” sara turned toward her the nervous twitch    seen again  her face  she seemed   trying  control it “what for” she said “for my kindness  you” replied miss minchin “for my kindness  giving you  home” sara went two or three steps nearer  her her thin little chest  heaving up  down  she spoke   strange unchildish voice “you  not kind” she said “you  not kind” and she turned again  went out   room leaving miss minchin staring after her strange small figure  stony anger the child walked up  staircase holding tightly  her doll she meant  go  her bedroom but   door she  met  miss amelia “you  not  go  there” she said “that  not your room now” “where  my room” asked sara “you   sleep   attic next   cook” sara walked on she mounted two flights more  reached  door   attic room opened   went in shutting  behind her she stood against   looked about her the room  slantingroofed  whitewashed there   rusty grate  iron bedstead  some odd articles  furniture sent up  better rooms below where they had been used until they  considered   worn out under  skylight   roof which showed nothing but  oblong piece  dull gray sky there   battered old red footstool sara went    sat down she   queer child  i have said before  quite unlike other children she seldom cried she did not cry now she laid her doll emily across her knees  put her face down upon her  her arms around her  sat there her little black head resting   black crape not saying one word not making one sound from  day her life changed entirely sometimes she used  feel  if  must  another life altogether  life  some other child she   little drudge  outcast she  given her lessons  odd times  expected  learn without being taught she  sent  errands  miss minchin miss amelia   cook nobody took any notice  her except when they ordered her about she  often kept busy all day  then sent into  deserted schoolroom   pile  books  learn her lessons or practise  night she had never been intimate   other pupils  soon she became so shabby that taking her queer clothes together  her queer little ways they began  look upon her   being  another world than their own the fact  that   rule miss minchins pupils  rather dull matteroffact young people accustomed  being rich  comfortable  sara  her elfish cleverness her desolate life  her odd habit  fixing her eyes upon them  staring them out  countenance  too much  them “she always looks  if she  finding you out” said one girl who  sly  given  making mischief “i am” said sara promptly when she heard  it “thats what i look  them for i like  know about people i think them over afterward” she never made any mischief herself or interfered  any one she talked very little did  she  told  thought  great deal nobody knew   fact nobody cared whether she  unhappy or happy unless perhaps   emily who lived   attic  slept   iron bedstead  night sara thought emily understood her feelings though she  only wax  had  habit  staring herself sara used  talk  her  night “you   only friend i have   world” she would say  her “why dont you say something why dont you speak sometimes i am sure you could if you would try it ought  make you try  know you   only thing i have if i  you i should try why dont you try” it really   very strange feeling she had about emily it arose  her being so desolate she did not like  own  herself  her only friend her only companion could feel  hear nothing she wanted  believe or  pretend  believe  emily understood  sympathized  her  she heard her even though she did not speak  answer she used  put her   chair sometimes  sit opposite  her   old red footstool  stare  her  think  pretend about her until her own eyes would grow large  something which  almost like fear particularly  night when  garret  so still when  only sound     heard   occasional squeak  scurry  rats   wainscot there  ratholes   garret  sara detested rats   always glad emily   her when she heard their hateful squeak  rush  scratching one  her “pretends”   emily   kind  good witch  could protect her poor little sara everything  “pretend”  her she had  strong imagination there  almost more imagination than there  sara  her whole forlorn uncaredfor childlife  made up  imaginings she imagined  pretended things until she almost believed them  she would scarcely have been surprised  any remarkable thing  could have happened so she insisted  herself  emily understood all about her troubles   really her friend “as  answering” she used  say “i dont answer very often i never answer when i can help it when people  insulting you there  nothing so good  them  not  say  wordjust  look  them  think miss minchin turns pale  rage when i do it miss amelia looks frightened so do  girls they know you  stronger than they are because you  strong enough  hold  your rage  they  not  they say stupid things they wish they hadnt said afterward theres nothing so strong  rage except what makes you hold  inthats stronger its  good thing not  answer your enemies i scarcely ever do perhaps emily  more like me than i am like myself perhaps she would rather not answer her friends even she keeps  all  her heart” but though she tried  satisfy herself  these arguments sara did not find  easy when after  long hard day  which she had been sent here  there sometimes  long errands through wind  cold  rain and when she came  wet  hungry had been sent out again because nobody chose  remember  she  only  child   her thin little legs might  tired  her small body clad   forlorn too small finery all too short  too tight might  chilled when she had been given only harsh words  cold slighting looks  thanks when  cook had been vulgar  insolent when miss minchin had been  her worst moods  when she had seen  girls sneering  her among themselves  making fun  her poor outgrown clothesthen sara did not find emily quite all  her sore proud desolate little heart needed   doll sat  her little old chair  stared one  these nights when she came up   garret cold hungry tired    tempest raging  her small breast emilys stare seemed so vacant her sawdust legs  arms so limp  inexpressive  sara lost all control over herself “i shall die presently” she said  first emily stared “i cant bear this” said  poor child trembling “i know i shall die im cold im wet im starving  death ive walked  thousand miles today  they have done nothing but scold me  morning until night and because i could not find  last thing they sent me for they would not give me any supper some men laughed  me because my old shoes made me slip down   mud im covered  mud now and they laughed do you hear” she looked   staring glass eyes  complacent wax face  suddenly  sort  heartbroken rage seized her she lifted her little savage hand  knocked emily off  chair bursting into  passion  sobbing “you  nothing but  doll” she cried “nothing but  dolldolldoll you care  nothing you  stuffed  sawdust you never had  heart nothing could ever make you feel you   doll” emily lay upon  floor  her legs ignominiously doubled up over her head   new flat place   end  her nose but she  still calm even dignified sara hid her face  her arms  sobbed some rats   wall began  fight  bite each other  squeak  scramble but  i have already intimated sara  not   habit  crying after  while she stopped  when she stopped she looked  emily who seemed   gazing  her around  side  one ankle  actually   kind  glassyeyed sympathy sara bent  picked her up remorse overtook her “you cant help being  doll” she said   resigned sigh “any more than those girls downstairs can help not having any sense we  not all alike perhaps you do your sawdust best” none  miss minchins young ladies  very remarkable  being brilliant they  select but some  them  very dull  some  them  fond  applying themselves  their lessons sara who snatched her lessons  all sorts  untimely hours  tattered  discarded books  who had  hungry craving  everything readable  often severe upon them  her small mind they had books they never read she had no books  all if she had always had something  read she would not have been so lonely she liked romances  history  poetry she would read anything there   sentimental housemaid   establishment who bought  weekly penny papers  subscribed   circulating library  which she got greasy volumes containing stories  marquises  dukes who invariably fell  love  orangegirls  gypsies  servantmaids  made them  proud brides  coronets  sara often did parts  this maids work so  she might earn  privilege  reading these romantic histories there  also  fat dull pupil whose name  ermengarde st john who  one  her resources ermengarde had  intellectual father who  his despairing desire  encourage his daughter constantly sent her valuable  interesting books which   continual source  grief  her sara had once actually found her crying over  big package  them “what   matter  you” she asked her perhaps rather disdainfully and   just possible she would not have spoken  her if she had not seen  books the sight  books always gave sara  hungry feeling  she could not help drawing near  them if only  read their titles “what   matter  you” she asked “my papa  sent me some more books” answered ermengarde woefully “and  expects me  read them” “dont you like reading” said sara “i hate it” replied miss ermengarde st john “and   ask me questions when  sees me   want  know how much i remember how would you like  have  read all those” “id like  better than anything else   world” said sara ermengarde wiped her eyes  look  such  prodigy “oh gracious” she exclaimed sara returned  look  interest a sudden plan formed itself  her sharp mind “look here” she said “if youll lend me those books ill read them  tell you everything thats  them afterward  ill tell   you so  you  remember it i know i can the a b c children always remember what i tell them” “oh goodness” said ermengarde “do you think you could” “i know i could” answered sara “i like  read  i always remember ill take care   books too they  look just  new  they do now when i give them back  you” ermengarde put her handkerchief  her pocket “if youll do that” she said “and if youll make me remember ill give youill give you some money” “i dont want your money” said sara “i want your booksi want them” and her eyes grew big  queer  her chest heaved once “take them then” said ermengarde “i wish i wanted them but i am not clever  my father is   thinks i ought  be” sara picked up  books  marched off  them but when she    door she stopped  turned around “what  you going  tell your father” she asked “oh” said ermengarde “he neednt know hell think ive read them” sara looked down   books her heart really began  beat fast “i wont do it” she said rather slowly “if you  going  tell him lies about iti dont like lies why cant you tell him i read them  then told you about them” “but  wants me  read them” said ermengarde “he wants you  know what   them” said sara “and if i can tell   you   easy way  make you remember i should think  would like that” “he would like  better if i read them myself” replied ermengarde “he  like it i dare say if you learn anything  any way” said sara “i should if i  your father” and though this  not  flattering way  stating  case ermengarde  obliged  admit   true and after  little more argument gave in and so she used afterward always  hand over her books  sara  sara would carry them  her garret  devour them  after she had read each volume she would return   tell ermengarde about    way  her own she had  gift  making things interesting her imagination helped her  make everything rather like  story  she managed this matter so well  miss st john gained more information  her books than she would have gained if she had read them three times over  her poor stupid little self when sara sat down  her  began  tell some story  travel or history she made  travellers  historical people seem real  ermengarde used  sit  regard her dramatic gesticulations her thin little flushed cheeks  her shining odd eyes  amazement “it sounds nicer than  seems   book” she would say “i never cared about mary queen  scots before  i always hated  french revolution but you make  seem like  story” “it   story” sara would answer “they  all stories everything   storyeverything  this world you   storyi am  storymiss minchin   story you can make  story out  anything” “i cant” said ermengarde sara stared  her  minute reflectively “no” she said  last “i suppose you couldnt you   little like emily” “who  emily” sara recollected herself she knew she  sometimes rather impolite   candor  her remarks  she did not want   impolite   girl who  not unkindonly stupid notwithstanding all her sharp little ways she had  sense  wish   just  everybody in  hours she spent alone she used  argue out  great many curious questions  herself one thing she had decided upon was   person who  clever ought   clever enough not   unjust or deliberately unkind  any one miss minchin  unjust  cruel miss amelia  unkind  spiteful  cook  malicious  hastytemperedthey all  stupid  made her despise them  she desired    unlike them  possible so she would   polite  she could  people who   least deserved politeness “emily isa personi know” she replied “do you like her” asked ermengarde “yes i do” said sara ermengarde examined her queer little face  figure again she did look odd she had on  day  faded blue plush skirt which barely covered her knees  brown cloth sacque   pair  olivegreen stockings which miss minchin had made her piece out  black ones so  they would  long enough   kept on and yet ermengarde  beginning slowly  admire her such  forlorn thin neglected little thing  that who could read  read  remember  tell you things so  they did not tire you all out a child who could speak french  who had learned german no one knew how one could not help staring  her  feeling interested particularly one  whom  simplest lesson   trouble   woe “do you like me” said ermengarde finally   end  her scrutiny sara hesitated one second then she answered “i like you because you  not illnaturedi like you  letting me read your booksi like you because you dont make spiteful fun  me  what i cant help its not your fault that” she pulled herself up quickly she had been going  say “that you  stupid” “that what” asked ermengarde “that you cant learn things quickly if you cant you cant if i can why i canthats all” she paused  minute looking   plump face before her  then rather slowly one  her wise oldfashioned thoughts came  her “perhaps” she said “to  able  learn things quickly isnt everything to  kind  worth  good deal  other people if miss minchin knew everything  earth which she doesnt  if she  like what she  now shed still   detestable thing  everybody would hate her lots  clever people have done harm  been wicked look  robespierre” she stopped again  examined her companions countenance “do you remember about him” she demanded “i believe youve forgotten” “well i dont remember all  it” admitted ermengarde “well” said sara  courage  determination “ill tell   you over again” and she plunged once more into  gory records   french revolution  told such stories  it  made such vivid pictures   horrors  miss st john  afraid  go  bed afterward  hid her head under  blankets when she did go  shivered until she fell asleep but afterward she preserved lively recollections   character  robespierre  did not even forget marie antoinette   princess de lamballe “you know they put her head   pike  danced around it” sara had said “and she had beautiful blonde hair  when i think  her i never see her head  her body but always   pike  those furious people dancing  howling” yes   true  this imaginative child everything   story   more books she read  more imaginative she became one  her chief entertainments   sit  her garret or walk about it  “suppose” things on  cold night when she had not had enough  eat she would draw  red footstool up before  empty grate  say   most intense voice “suppose there   grate wide steel grate here   great glowing firea glowing firewith beds  redhot coal  lots  little dancing flickering flames suppose there   soft deep rug  this   comfortable chair all cushions  crimson velvet  suppose i had  crimson velvet frock on   deep lace collar like  child   picture  suppose all  rest   room  furnished  lovely colors  there  bookshelves full  books which changed  magic  soon  you had read them  suppose there   little table here   snowwhite cover  it  little silver dishes   one there  hot hot soup   another  roast chicken   another some raspberryjam tarts  crisscross  them   another some grapes  suppose emily could speak  we could sit  eat our supper  then talk  read  then suppose there   soft warm bed   corner  when we  tired we could go  sleep  sleep  long  we liked” sometimes after she had supposed things like these  half  hour she would feel almost warm  would creep into bed  emily  fall asleep   smile  her face “what large downy pillows” she would whisper “what white sheets  fleecy blankets” and she almost forgot  her real pillows had scarcely any feathers  them  all  smelled musty   her blankets  coverlid  thin  full  holes at another time she would “suppose” she   princess  then she would go about  house   expression  her face which   source  great secret annoyance  miss minchin because  seemed  if  child scarcely heard  spiteful insulting things said  her or if she heard them did not care  them  all sometimes while she    midst  some harsh  cruel speech miss minchin would find  odd unchildish eyes fixed upon her  something like  proud smile  them at such times she did not know  sara  saying  herself “you dont know  you  saying these things   princess   if i chose i could wave my hand  order you  execution i only spare you because i am  princess  you   poor stupid old vulgar thing  dont know any better” this used  please  amuse her more than anything else  queer  fanciful   was she found comfort  it    not  bad thing  her it really kept her  being made rude  malicious   rudeness  malice  those about her “a princess must  polite” she said  herself and so when  servants who took their tone  their mistress  insolent  ordered her about she would hold her head erect  reply  them sometimes   way which made them stare  her   so quaintly civil “i am  princess  rags  tatters” she would think “but i am  princess inside it would  easy    princess if i  dressed  clothofgold    great deal more   triumph   one all  time when no one knows it there  marie antoinette when she   prison  her throne  gone  she had only  black gown on  her hair  white  they insulted her  called her  widow capetshe   great deal more like  queen then than when she  so gay  had everything grand i like her best then those howling mobs  people did not frighten her she  stronger than they  even when they cut her head off” once when such thoughts  passing through her mind  look  her eyes so enraged miss minchin  she flew  sara  boxed her ears sara awakened  her dream started  little  then broke into  laugh “what  you laughing at you bold impudent child” exclaimed miss minchin it took sara  few seconds  remember she   princess her cheeks  red  smarting   blows she had received “i  thinking” she said “beg my pardon immediately” said miss minchin “i  beg your pardon  laughing if   rude” said sara “but i wont beg your pardon  thinking” “what  you thinking” demanded miss minchin “how dare you think what  you thinking” this occurred   schoolroom  all  girls looked up  their books  listen it always interested them when miss minchin flew  sara because sara always said something queer  never seemed   least frightened she  not   least frightened now though her boxed ears  scarlet  her eyes   bright  stars “i  thinking” she answered gravely  quite politely “that you did not know what you  doing” “that i did not know what i  doing” miss minchin fairly gasped “yes” said sara “and i  thinking what would happen if i   princess  you boxed my earswhat i should do  you and i  thinking  if i  one you would never dare  do it whatever i said or did and i  thinking how surprised  frightened you would  if you suddenly found out” she had  imagined picture so clearly before her eyes  she spoke   manner which had  effect even  miss minchin it almost seemed   moment  her narrow unimaginative mind  there must  some real power behind this candid daring “what” she exclaimed “found out what” “that i really   princess” said sara “and could do anythinganything i liked” “go  your room” cried miss minchin breathlessly “this instant leave  schoolroom attend  your lessons young ladies” sara made  little bow “excuse me  laughing if   impolite” she said  walked out   room leaving miss minchin   rage   girls whispering over their books “i shouldnt   all surprised if she did turn out   something” said one  them “suppose she should” that very afternoon sara had  opportunity  proving  herself whether she  really  princess or not it   dreadful afternoon for several days  had rained continuously  streets  chilly  sloppy there  mud everywheresticky london mudand over everything  pall  fog  drizzle of course there  several long  tiresome errands   donethere always   days like thisand sara  sent out again  again until her shabby clothes  damp through the absurd old feathers  her forlorn hat  more draggled  absurd than ever  her downtrodden shoes  so wet they could not hold any more water added  this she had been deprived  her dinner because miss minchin wished  punish her she  very hungry she  so cold  hungry  tired  her little face had  pinched look  now  then some kindhearted person passing her   crowded street glanced  her  sympathy but she did not know that she hurried on trying  comfort herself   queer way  hers  pretending  “supposing”but really this time   harder than she had ever found it  once or twice she thought  almost made her more cold  hungry instead  less so but she persevered obstinately “suppose i had dry clothes on” she thought “suppose i had good shoes   long thick coat  merino stockings   whole umbrella and supposesuppose just when i  near  bakers where they sold hot buns i should find sixpencewhich belonged  nobody suppose if i did i should go into  shop  buy six   hottest buns  should eat them all without stopping” some very odd things happen  this world sometimes it certainly   odd thing which happened  sara she had  cross  street just  she  saying this  herselfthe mud  dreadfulshe almost had  wade she picked her way  carefully  she could but she could not save herself much only  picking her way she had  look down  her feet   mud   looking downjust  she reached  pavementshe saw something shining   gutter a piece  silvera tiny piece trodden upon  many feet but still  spirit enough  shine  little not quite  sixpence but  next thing  ita fourpenny piece in one second    her cold little red  blue hand “oh” she gasped “it  true” and then if you  believe me she looked straight before her   shop directly facing her and    bakers   cheerful stout motherly woman  rosy cheeks  just putting into  window  tray  delicious hot bunslarge plump shiny buns  currants  them it almost made sara feel faint   few secondsthe shock   sight   buns   delightful odors  warm bread floating up through  bakers cellarwindow she knew  she need not hesitate  use  little piece  money it had evidently been lying   mud  some time   owner  completely lost   streams  passing people who crowded  jostled each other all through  day “but ill go  ask  bakers woman if she  lost  piece  money” she said  herself rather faintly so she crossed  pavement  put her wet foot   step   shop   she did so she saw something which made her stop it   little figure more forlorn than her owna little figure which  not much more than  bundle  rags  which small bare red  muddy feet peeped outonly because  rags  which  wearer  trying  cover them  not long enough above  rags appeared  shock head  tangled hair   dirty face  big hollow hungry eyes sara knew they  hungry eyes  moment she saw them  she felt  sudden sympathy “this” she said  herself   little sigh “is one   populaceand she  hungrier than i am” the childthis “one   populace”stared up  sara  shuffled herself aside  little so   give her more room she  used  being made  give room  everybody she knew  if  policeman chanced  see her  would tell her  “move on” sara clutched her little fourpenny piece  hesitated  few seconds then she spoke  her “are you hungry” she asked the child shuffled herself  her rags  little more “aint i jist” she said   hoarse voice “jist aint i” “havent you had any dinner” said sara “no dinner” more hoarsely still   more shuffling “nor yet no brefastnor yet no suppernor nothin” “since when” asked sara “dunno never got nothin todaynowhere ive axed  axed” just  look  her made sara more hungry  faint but those queer little thoughts   work  her brain  she  talking  herself though she  sick  heart “if im  princess” she  saying“if im  princess when they  poor  driven  their thronesthey always sharedwith  populaceif they met one poorer  hungrier they always shared buns   penny each if  had been sixpence i could have eaten six it wont  enough  either

you find it” “in  gutter” said sara “keep it then” said  woman “it may have been there  week  goodness knows who lost it you could never find out” “i know that” said sara “but i thought id ask you” “not many would” said  woman looking puzzled  interested  goodnatured all  once “do you want  buy something” she added  she saw sara glance toward  buns “four buns if you please” said sara “those   penny each” the woman went   window  put some   paper bag sara noticed  she put  six “i said four if you please” she explained “i have only  fourpence” “ill throw  two  makeweight” said  woman  her goodnatured look “i dare say you can eat them some time arent you hungry” a mist rose before saras eyes “yes” she answered “i am very hungry  i am much obliged  you  your kindness and” she  going  add “there   child outside who  hungrier than i am” but just   moment two or three customers came   once  each one seemed   hurry so she could only thank  woman again  go out the child  still huddled up   corner   steps she looked frightful  her wet  dirty rags she  staring   stupid look  suffering straight before her  sara saw her suddenly draw  back  her roughened black hand across her eyes  rub away  tears which seemed  have surprised her  forcing their way  under her lids she  muttering  herself sara opened  paper bag  took out one   hot buns which had already warmed her cold hands  little “see” she said putting  bun   ragged lap “that  nice  hot eat it  you  not  so hungry” the child started  stared up  her then she snatched up  bun  began  cram  into her mouth  great wolfish bites “oh my oh my” sara heard her say hoarsely  wild delight “oh my” sara took out three more buns  put them down “she  hungrier than i am” she said  herself “shes starving” but her hand trembled when she put down  fourth bun “im not starving” she saidand she put down  fifth the little starving london savage  still snatching  devouring when she turned away she  too ravenous  give any thanks even if she had been taught politenesswhich she had not she  only  poor little wild animal “goodbye” said sara when she reached  other side   street she looked back the child had  bun  both hands  had stopped   middle   bite  watch her sara gave her  little nod   child after another starea curious longing starejerked her shaggy head  response  until sara  out  sight she did not take another bite or even finish  one she had begun at  moment  bakerwoman glanced out  her shopwindow “well i never” she exclaimed “if  youngun hasnt given her buns   beggarchild it wasnt because she didnt want them eitherwell well she looked hungry enough id give something  know what she did  for” she stood behind her window   few moments  pondered then her curiosity got  better  her she went   door  spoke   beggarchild “who gave you those buns” she asked her the child nodded her head toward saras vanishing figure “what did she say” inquired  woman “axed me if i  ungry” replied  hoarse voice “what did you say” “said i  jist” “and then she came   got buns  came out  gave them  you did she” the child nodded “how many” “five” the woman thought  over “left just one  herself” she said   low voice “and she could have eaten  whole sixi saw   her eyes” she looked after  little draggled faraway figure  felt more disturbed  her usually comfortable mind than she had felt  many  day “i wish she hadnt gone so quick” she said “im blest if she shouldnt have had  dozen” then she turned   child “are you hungry yet” she asked “im allus ungry”   answer “but taint so bad   was” “come  here” said  woman  she held open  shopdoor the child got up  shuffled in to  invited into  warm place full  bread seemed  incredible thing she did not know what  going  happen she did not care even “get yourself warm” said  woman pointing   fire   tiny back room “and look herewhen youre hard up   bite  bread you can come here  ask  it im blest if i wont give   you   young uns sake” sara found some comfort  her remaining bun it  hot     great deal better than nothing she broke off small pieces  ate them slowly  make  last longer “suppose    magic bun” she said “and  bite   much   whole dinner i should  overeating myself if i went  like this” it  dark when she reached  square  which miss minchins select seminary  situated  lamps  lighted   most   windows gleams  light    seen it always interested sara  catch glimpses   rooms before  shutters  closed she liked  imagine things about people who sat before  fires   houses or who bent over books   tables there was  instance  large family opposite she called these people  large familynot because they  large  indeed most  them  littlebut because there  so many  them there  eight children   large family   stout rosy mother   stout rosy father   stout rosy grandmamma  any number  servants the eight children  always either being taken out  walk or  ride  perambulators  comfortable nurses or they  going  drive  their mamma or they  flying   door   evening  kiss their papa  dance around him  drag off his overcoat  look  packages   pockets  it or they  crowding about  nursery windows  looking out  pushing each other  laughingin fact they  always doing something which seemed enjoyable  suited   tastes   large family sara  quite attached  them  had given them all names out  books she called them  montmorencys when she did not call them  large family the fat

spaniel but sara  not so very fond  her because she did nothing  particular but talk   parrots  drive out   spaniel the most interesting person  all lived next door  miss minchin herself sara called him  indian gentleman he   elderly gentleman who  said  have lived   east indies    immensely rich   have something  matter  his liverin fact  had been rumored   had no liver  all   much inconvenienced   fact at any rate   very yellow   did not look happy  when  went out  his carriage   almost always wrapped up  shawls  overcoats  if   cold he had  native servant who looked even colder than himself   had  monkey who looked colder than  native servant sara had seen  monkey sitting   table   sun   parlor window   always wore such  mournful expression  she sympathized  him deeply “i dare say” she used sometimes  remark  herself “he  thinking all  time  cocoanut trees   swinging  his tail under  tropical sun he might have had  family dependent  him too poor thing” the native servant whom she called  lascar looked mournful too but   evidently very faithful  his master “perhaps  saved his masters life   sepoy rebellion” she thought “they look  if they might have had all sorts  adventures i wish i could speak   lascar i remember  little hindustani” and one day she actually did speak  him  his start   sound  his own language expressed  great deal  surprise  delight he  waiting  his master  come out   carriage  sara who  going   errand  usual stopped  spoke  few words she had  special gift  languages  had remembered enough hindustani  make herself understood  him when his master came out  lascar spoke  him quickly   indian gentleman turned  looked  her curiously and afterward  lascar always greeted her  salaams   most profound description and occasionally they exchanged  few words she learned    true   sahib  very richthat   illand also   had no wife nor children   england did not agree   monkey “he must   lonely  i am” thought sara “being rich does not seem  make him happy” that evening  she passed  windows  lascar  closing  shutters  she caught  glimpse   room inside there   bright fire glowing   grate   indian gentleman  sitting before it   luxurious chair the room  richly furnished  looked delightfully comfortable but  indian gentleman sat  his head resting  his hand  looked  lonely  unhappy  ever “poor man” said sara “i wonder what you  supposing” when she went into  house she met miss minchin   hall “where have you wasted your time” said miss minchin “you have been out  hours” “it  so wet  muddy” sara answered “it  hard  walk because my shoes  so bad  slipped about so” “make no excuses” said miss minchin “and tell no falsehoods” sara went downstairs   kitchen “why didnt you stay all night” said  cook “here   things” said sara  laid her purchases   table the cook looked over them grumbling she    very bad temper indeed “may i have something  eat” sara asked rather faintly “teas over  done with”   answer “did you expect me  keep  hot  you” sara  silent  second “i had no dinner” she said  her voice  quite low she made  low because she  afraid  would tremble “theres some bread   pantry” said  cook “thats all youll get  this time  day” sara went  found  bread it  old  hard  dry the cook   too bad  humor  give her anything  eat  it she had just been scolded  miss minchin    always safe  easy  vent her own spite  sara really   hard   child  climb  three long flights  stairs leading  her garret she often found them long  steep when she  tired but tonight  seemed  if she would never reach  top several times  lump rose  her throat  she  obliged  stop  rest “i cant pretend anything more tonight” she said wearily  herself “im sure i cant ill eat my bread  drink some water  then go  sleep  perhaps  dream  come  pretend  me i wonder what dreams are” yes when she reached  top landing there  tears  her eyes  she did not feel like  princessonly like  tired hungry lonely lonely child “if my papa had lived” she said “they would not have treated me like this if my papa had lived  would have taken care  me” then she turned  handle  opened  garretdoor can you imagine itcan you believe it i find  hard  believe  myself and sara found  impossible   first few moments she thought something strange had happened  her eyesto her mindthat  dream had come before she had had time  fall asleep “oh” she exclaimed breathlessly “oh  isnt true i know i know  isnt true” and she slipped into  room  closed  door  locked it  stood  her back against it staring straight before her do you wonder in  grate which had been empty  rusty  cold when she left it but which now  blackened  polished up quite respectably there   glowing blazing fire on  hob   little brass kettle hissing  boiling spread upon  floor   warm thick rug before  fire   foldingchair unfolded   cushions  it   chair   small foldingtable unfolded covered   white cloth  upon   spread small covered dishes  cup  saucer   teapot   bed  new warm coverings  curious wadded silk robe  some books the little cold miserable room seemed changed into fairyland it  actually warm  glowing “it  bewitched” said sara “or i am bewitched i only think i see  all but if i can only keep  thinking it i dont carei dont careif i can only keep  up” she  afraid  move  fear  would melt away she stood  her back against  door  looked  looked but soon she began  feel warm  then she moved forward “a fire  i only thought i saw surely wouldnt feel warm” she said “it feels realreal” she went    knelt before it she touched  chair  table she lifted  cover  one   dishes there  something hot  savory  itsomething delicious the teapot had tea  it ready   boiling water   little kettle one plate had toast  it another muffins “it  real” said sara “the fire  real enough  warm me i can sit   chair  things  real enough  eat” it  like  fairy story come trueit  heavenly she went   bed  touched  blankets   wrap they  real too she opened one book    titlepage  written   strange hand “the little girl   attic” suddenlywas   strange thing  her  dosara put her face down   queer foreign looking quilted robe  burst into tears “i dont know who  is” she said “but somebody cares about me  littlesomebody  my friend” somehow  thought warmed her more than  fire she had never had  friend since those happy luxurious days when she had had everything  those days had seemed such  long way offso far away    only like dreamsduring these last years  miss minchins she really cried more  this strange thought  having  friendeven though  unknown onethan she had cried over many  her worst troubles but these tears seemed different   others  when she had wiped them away they did not seem  leave her eyes  her heart hot  smarting and then imagine if you can what  rest   evening  like the delicious comfort  taking off  damp clothes  putting   soft warm quilted robe before  glowing fireof slipping her cold feet into  luscious little woollined slippers she found near her chair and then  hot tea  savory dishes  cushioned chair   books it  just like sara that once having found  things real she should give herself up   enjoyment  them   very utmost she had lived such  life  imagining  had found her pleasure so long  improbabilities  she  quite equal  accepting any wonderful thing  happened after she  quite warm  had eaten her supper  enjoyed herself   hour or so  had almost ceased   surprising  her  such magical surroundings should  hers as  finding out who had done all this she knew    out   question she did not know  human soul  whom  could seem   least degree probable   could have been done “there  nobody” she said  herself “nobody” she discussed  matter  emily   true but more because   delightful  talk about  than   view  making any discoveries “but we have  friend emily” she said “we have  friend” sara could not even imagine  being charming enough  fill her grand ideal  her mysterious benefactor if she tried  make  her mind  picture  him or her  ended  being something glittering  strangenot  all like  real person but bearing resemblance   sort  eastern magician  long robes   wand and when she fell asleep beneath  soft white blanket she dreamed all night  this magnificent personage  talked  him  hindustani  made salaams  him upon one thing she  determined she would not speak  any one  her good fortuneit should  her own secret  fact she  rather inclined  think  if miss minchin knew she would take her treasures  her or  some way spoil her pleasure so when she went down  next morning she shut her door very tight  did her best  look  if nothing unusual had occurred and yet this  rather hard because she could not help remembering every now  then   sort  start  her heart would beat quickly every time she repeated  herself “i have  friend” it   friend who evidently meant  continue   kind  when she went  her garret  next nightand she opened  door  must  confessed  rather  excited feelingshe found   same hands had been again  work  had done even more than before the fire   supper  again there  beside them  number  other things which so altered  look   garret  sara quite lost her breath a piece  bright strange heavy cloth covered  battered mantel    some ornaments had been placed all  bare ugly things which could  covered  draperies had been concealed  made  look quite pretty some odd materials  rich colors had been fastened against  walls  sharp fine tacksso sharp  they could  pressed into  wood without hammering some brilliant fans  pinned up  there  several large cushions a long old wooden box  covered   rug  some cushions lay  it so   wore quite  air   sofa sara simply sat down  looked  looked again “it  exactly like something fairy come true” she said “there isnt  least difference i feel  if i might wish  anythingdiamonds  bags  goldand they would appear that couldnt  any stranger than this is this my garret am i  same cold ragged damp sara and  think how i used  pretend  pretend  wish there  fairies the one thing i always wanted   see  fairy story come true i am living   fairy story i feel  if i might   fairy myself   able  turn things into anything else” it  like  fairy story and what  best  all  continued almost every day something new  done   garret some new comfort or ornament appeared   when sara opened her door  night until actually   short time    bright little room full  all sorts  odd  luxurious things and  magician had taken care   child should not  hungry   she should have  many books  she could read when she left  room   morning  remains  her supper    table  when she returned   evening  magician had removed them  left another nice little meal downstairs miss minchin   cruel  insulting  ever miss amelia   peevish   servants   vulgar sara  sent  errands  scolded  driven hither  thither but somehow  seemed  if she could bear  all the delightful sense  romance  mystery lifted her above  cooks temper  malice the comfort she enjoyed  could always look forward   making her stronger if she came home  her errands wet  tired she knew she would soon  warm after she had climbed  stairs in  few weeks she began  look less thin a little color came into her cheeks  her eyes did not seem much too big  her face it  just when this  beginning   so apparent  miss minchin sometimes stared  her questioningly  another wonderful thing happened a man came   door  left several parcels all  addressed in large letters  “the little girl   attic” sara herself  sent  open  door  she took them in she laid  two largest parcels down   halltable   looking   address when miss minchin came down  stairs “take  things upstairs   young lady  whom they belong” she said “dont stand there staring  them” “they belong  me” answered sara quietly “to you” exclaimed miss minchin “what do you mean” “i dont know where they came from” said sara “but theyre addressed  me” miss minchin came  her side  looked  them   excited expression “what   them” she demanded “i dont know” said sara “open them” she demanded still more excitedly sara did  she  told they contained pretty  comfortable clothingclothing  different kinds shoes  stockings  gloves  warm coat  even  umbrella on  pocket   coat  pinned  paper  which  written “to  worn every daywill  replaced  others when necessary” miss minchin  quite agitated this   incident which suggested strange things  her sordid mind could    she had made  mistake after all    child so neglected  so unkindly treated  her had some powerful friend   background it would not  very pleasant if there should  such  friend   or she should learn all  truth about  thin shabby clothes  scant food  hard work she felt queer indeed  uncertain  she gave  sideglance  sara “well” she said   voice such  she had never used since  day  child lost her father“well some one  very kind  you as you have  things    have new ones when they  worn out you may  well go  put them   look respectable  after you  dressed you may come downstairs  learn your lessons   schoolroom” so  happened that about half  hour afterward sara struck  entire schoolroom  pupils dumb  amazement  making her appearance   costume such  she had never worn since  change  fortune whereby she ceased    showpupil   parlorboarder she scarcely seemed    same sara she  neatly dressed   pretty gown  warm browns  reds  even her stockings  slippers  nice  dainty “perhaps some one  left her  fortune” one   girls whispered “i always thought something would happen  her she  so queer” that night when sara went  her room she carried out  plan she had been devising  some time she wrote  note  her unknown friend it ran  follows “i hope you  not think   not polite  i should write this note  you when you wish  keep yourself  secret but i do not mean   impolite or  try  find out  all only i want  thank you  being so kind  meso beautiful kind  making everything like  fairy story i am so grateful  you  i am so happy i used   so lonely  cold and hungry  now oh just think what you have done  me please let me say just these words it seems  if i ought  say them thank youthank youthank you “the little girl in the attic” the next morning she left this   little table    taken away   other things so she felt sure  magician had received it  she  happier   thought a few nights later  very odd thing happened she found something   room which she certainly would never have expected when she came   usual she saw something small  dark  her chairan odd tiny figure which turned toward her  little weirdlooking wistful face “why its  monkey” she cried “it   indian gentlemans monkey where can  have come from” it   monkey sitting up  looking so like  mite   child   really  quite pathetic  very soon sara found out how  happened    her room the skylight  open    easy  guess   had crept out  his masters garretwindow which  only  few feet away  perfectly easy  get   out of even   climber less agile than  monkey he had probably climbed   garret   tour  investigation  getting out upon  roof  being attracted   light  saras attic had crept in at all events this seemed quite reasonable  there  was  when sara went  him  actually put out his queer elfish little hands caught her dress  jumped into her arms “oh you queer poor ugly foreign little thing” said sara caressing him “i cant help liking you you look like  sort  baby but i am so glad you  not because your mother could not  proud  you  nobody would dare  say you  like any  your relations but i do like you you have such  forlorn little look  your face perhaps you  sorry you  so ugly  its always  your mind i wonder if you have  mind” the monkey sat  looked  her while she talked  seemed much interested  her remarks if one could judge  his eyes  his forehead   way  moved his head up  down  held  sideways  scratched   his little hand he examined sara quite seriously  anxiously too he felt  stuff  her dress touched her hands climbed up  examined her ears  then sat  her shoulder holding  lock  her hair looking mournful but not  all agitated upon  whole  seemed pleased  sara “but i must take you back” she said  him “though im sorry  have  do it oh  company you would    person” she lifted him  her shoulder set him  her knee  gave him  bit  cake he sat  nibbled it  then put his head  one side looked  her wrinkled his forehead  then nibbled again   most companionable manner “but you must go home” said sara  last  she took him  her arms  carry him downstairs evidently  did not want  leave  room   they reached  door  clung  her neck  gave  little scream  anger “you mustnt   ungrateful monkey” said sara “you ought   fondest  your own family i am sure  lascar  good  you” nobody saw her  her way out  very soon she  standing   indian gentlemans front steps   lascar had opened  door  her “i found your monkey  my room” she said  hindustani “i think  got  through  window” the man began  rapid outpouring  thanks but just      midst  them  fretful hollow voice  heard through  open door   nearest room the instant  heard   lascar disappeared  left sara still holding  monkey it  not many moments however before  came back bringing  message his master had told him  bring missy into  library the sahib  very ill but  wished  see missy sara thought this odd but she remembered reading stories  indian gentlemen who having no constitutions  extremely cross  full  whims  who must have their own way so she followed  lascar when she entered  room  indian gentleman  lying   easy chair propped up  pillows he looked frightfully ill his yellow face  thin  his eyes  hollow he gave sara  rather curious lookit   if she wakened  him some anxious interest “you live next door”  said “yes” answered sara “i live  miss minchins” “she keeps  boardingschool” “yes” said sara “and you  one  her pupils” sara hesitated  moment “i dont know exactly what i am” she replied “why not” asked  indian gentleman the monkey gave  tiny squeak  sara stroked him “at first” she said “i   pupil   parlor boarder but now” “what do you mean  at first” asked  indian gentleman “when i  first taken there  my papa” “well what  happened since then” said  invalid staring  her  knitting his brows   puzzled expression “my papa died” said sara “he lost all his money  there  none left  meand there  no one  take care  me or pay miss minchin so” “so you  sent up into  garret  neglected  made into  halfstarved little drudge” put   indian gentleman “that  about it isnt it” the color deepened  saras cheeks “there  no one  take care  me  no money” she said “i belong  nobody” “what did your father mean  losing his money” said  gentleman fretfully the red  saras cheeks grew deeper  she fixed her odd eyes   yellow face “he did not lose  himself” she said “he had  friend   fond of    his friend who took his money i dont know how i dont understand he trusted his friend too much” she saw  invalid startthe strangest startas if  had been suddenly frightened then  spoke nervously  excitedly “thats  old story”  said “it happens every day but sometimes those who  blamedthose who do  wrongdont intend it   not so bad it may happen through  mistakea miscalculation they may not  so bad” “no” said sara “but  suffering  just  bad   others it killed my papa” the indian gentleman pushed aside some   gorgeous wraps  covered him “come  little nearer  let me look  you”  said his voice sounded very strange  had  more nervous  excited tone than before sara had  odd fancy    half afraid  look  her she came  stood nearer  monkey clinging  her  watching his master anxiously over his shoulder the indian gentlemans hollow restless eyes fixed themselves  her “yes”  said  last “yes i can see it tell me your fathers name” “his name  ralph crewe” said sara “captain crewe perhaps”a sudden thought flashing upon her“perhaps you may have heard  him he died  india” the indian gentleman sank back upon his pillows he looked very weak  seemed out  breath “yes”  said “i knew him i  his friend i meant no harm if  had only lived  would have known it turned out well after all he   fine young fellow i  fond  him i  make  right callcall  man” sara thought   going  die but there  no need  call  lascar he must have been waiting   door he    room   his masters side   instant he seemed  know what  do he lifted  drooping head  gave  invalid something   small glass the indian gentleman lay panting   few minutes  then  spoke   exhausted but eager voice addressing  lascar  hindustani “go  carmichael”  said “tell him  come here  once tell him i have found  child” when mr carmichael arrived which occurred   very few minutes   turned out    no other than  father   large family across  street sara went home   allowed  take  monkey  her she certainly did not sleep very much  night though  monkey behaved beautifully  did not disturb her   least it  not  monkey  kept her awakeit  her thoughts  her wonders   what  indian gentleman had meant when  said “tell him i have found  child” “what child” sara kept asking herself “i   only child there but how had  found me  why did  want  find me and what   going  do now i am found is  something about my papa do i belong  somebody is  one  my relations is something going  happen” but she found out  very next day   morning   seemed  she had been living   story even more than she had imagined first mr carmichael came  had  interview  miss minchin and  appeared  mr carmichael besides occupying  important situation  father   large family   lawyer  had charge   affairs  mr carrisfordwhich   real name   indian gentlemanand  mr carrisfords lawyer mr carmichael had come  explain something curious  miss minchin regarding sara but being  father   large family  had  very kind  fatherly feeling  children  so after seeing miss minchin alone what did  do but go  bring across  square his rosy motherly warmhearted wife so  she herself might talk   little lonely girl  tell her everything   best  most motherly way and then sara learned  she     poor little drudge  outcast no more    great change had come  her fortunes  all  lost fortune had come back  her   great deal had even been added  it it  mr carrisford who had been her fathers friend  who had made  investments which had caused him  apparent loss  his money but  had so happened  after poor young captain crewes death one   investments which had seemed   time  very worst had taken  sudden turn  proved   such  success   had been  mine  wealth  had more than doubled  captains lost fortune  well  making  fortune  mr carrisford himself but mr carrisford had been very unhappy he had truly loved his poor handsome generous young friend   knowledge   had caused his death had weighed upon him always  broken both his health  spirit the worst   had been that when first  thought himself  captain crewe ruined  had lost courage  gone away because   not brave enough  face  consequences  what  had done  so  had not even known where  young soldiers little girl had been placed when  wanted  find her  make restitution  could discover no trace  her   certainty  she  poor  friendless somewhere had made him more miserable than ever when  had taken  house next  miss minchins  had been so ill  wretched   had   time given up  search his troubles   indian climate had brought him almost  deaths doorindeed  had not expected  live more than  few months and then one day  lascar had told him about saras speaking hindustani  gradually  had begun  take  sort  interest   forlorn child though  had only caught  glimpse  her once or twice   had not connected her   child  his friend perhaps because   too languid  think much about anything but  lascar had found out something  saras unhappy little life  about  garret one evening  had actually crept out  his own garretwindow  looked into hers which   very easy matter because  i have said   only  few feet awayand  had told his master what  had seen    moment  compassion  indian gentleman had told him  take into  wretched little room such comforts   could carry   one window   other and  lascar who had developed  interest in   odd fondness for  child who had spoken  him  his own tongue had been pleased   work and having  silent swiftness  agile movements  many  his race  had made his evening journeys across  few feet  roof  garretwindow  garretwindow without any trouble  all he had watched saras movements until  knew exactly when she  absent  her room  when she returned  it  so  had been able  calculate  best times  his work generally  had made them   dusk   evening but once or twice when  had seen her go out  errands  had dared  go over   daytime being quite sure   garret  never entered  any one but herself his pleasure   work  his reports   results had added   invalids interest  it  sometimes  master had found  planning gave him something  think of which made him almost forget his weariness  pain and  last when sara brought home  truant monkey  had felt  wish  see her  then her likeness  her father had done  rest “and now my dear” said good mrs carmichael patting saras hand “all your troubles  over i am sure  you   come home  me   taken care   if you  one  my own little girls  we  so pleased  think  having you  us until everything  settled  mr carrisford  better the excitement  last night  made him very weak but we really think   get well now  such  load  taken  his mind and when   stronger i am sure     kind  you  your own papa would have been he   very good heart    fond  childrenand   no family  all but we must make you happy  rosy  you must learn  play  run about  my little girls do” “as your little girls do” said sara “i wonder if i could i used  watch them  wonder what   like shall i feel  if i belonged  somebody” “ah my love yesyes” said mrs carmichael “dear me yes” and her motherly blue eyes grew quite moist  she suddenly took sara  her arms  kissed her that very night before she went  sleep sara had made  acquaintance   entire large family  such excitement  she   monkey had caused   joyous circle could hardly  described there  not  child   nursery   eton boy who   eldest   baby who   youngest who had not laid some offering  her shrine all  older ones knew something  her wonderful story she had been born  india she had been poor  lonely  unhappy  had lived   garret  been treated unkindly  now she    rich  happy   taken care of they  so sorry  her  so delighted  curious about her all  once the girls wished    her constantly   little boys wished   told about india  second baby   short round legs simply sat  stared  her   monkey possibly wondering why she had not brought  handorgan  her “i shall certainly wake up presently” sara kept saying  herself “this one must   dream the other one turned out   real but this couldnt be but oh how happy  is” and even when she went  bed   bright pretty room not far  mrs carmichaels own  mrs carmichael came  kissed her  patted her  tucked her  cozily she  not sure  she would not wake up   garret   morning “and oh charles dear” mrs carmichael said  her husband when she went downstairs  him “we must get  lonely look out  her eyes it isnt  childs look  all i couldnt bear  see   one  my own children what  poor little love must have had  bear   dreadful womans house but surely she  forget   time” but though  lonely look passed away  saras face she never quite forgot  garret  miss minchins and indeed she always liked  remember  wonderful night when  tired princess crept upstairs cold  wet  opening  door found fairyland waiting  her and there  no one   many stories she  always being called upon  tell   nursery   large family which  more popular than  particular one  there  no one  whom  large family  so fond   sara mr carrisford did not die but recovered  sara went  live  him  no real princess could have been better taken care  than she was it seemed   indian gentleman could not do enough  make her happy   repay her   past   lascar  her devoted slave as her odd little face grew brighter  grew so pretty  interesting  mr carrisford used  sit  watch  many  evening  they sat   fire together they became great friends  they used  spend hours reading  talking together and   very short time there  no pleasanter sight   indian gentleman than sara sitting  her big chair   opposite side   hearth   book  her knee  her soft dark hair tumbling over her warm cheeks she had  pretty habit  looking up  him suddenly   bright smile  then  would often say  her “are you happy sara” and then she would answer “i feel like  real princess uncle tom” he had told her  call him uncle tom “there doesnt seem   anything left  suppose” she added there   little joke between them     magician  so could do anything  liked    one  his pleasures  invent plans  surprise her  enjoyments she had not thought of scarcely  day passed  which  did not do something new  her sometimes she found new flowers  her room sometimes  fanciful little gift tucked into some odd corner sometimes  new book  her pillowonce  they sat together   evening they heard  scratch   heavy paw   door   room  when sara went  find out what  was there stood  great doga splendid russian boarhound   grand silver  gold collar stooping  read  inscription upon  collar sara  delighted  read  words “i am boris i serve  princess sara” then there   sort  fairy nursery arranged   entertainment   juvenile members   large family who  always coming  see sara   lascar   monkey sara   fond   large family  they   her she soon felt  if she   member  it   companionship   healthy happy children  very good  her all  children rather looked up  her  regarded her   cleverest  most brilliant  creaturesparticularly after   discovered  she not only knew stories  every kind  could invent new ones   moments notice but  she could help  lessons  speak french  german  discourse   lascar  hindustani it  rather  painful experience  miss minchin  watch her expupils fortunes  she had  daily opportunity  do   feel  she had made  serious mistake   business point  view she had even tried  retrieve   suggesting  saras education should  continued under her care  had gone   length  making  appeal   child herself “i have always been very fond  you” she said then sara fixed her eyes upon her  gave her one  her odd looks “have you” she answered “yes” said miss minchin “amelia  i have always said you   cleverest child we had  us  i am sure we could make you happyas  parlor boarder” sara thought   garret   day her ears  boxedand   other day  dreadful desolate day when she had been told  she belonged  nobody  she had no home  no friendsand she kept her eyes fixed  miss minchins face “you know why i would not stay  you” she said and  seems probable  miss minchin did  after  simple answer she had not  boldness  pursue  subject she merely sent   bill   expense  saras education  support  she made  quite large enough and because mr carrisford thought sara would wish  paid   paid when mr carmichael paid   had  brief interview  miss minchin  which  expressed his opinion  much clearness  force    quite certain  miss minchin did not enjoy  conversation sara had been about  month  mr carrisford  had begun  realize  her happiness  not  dream when one night  indian gentleman saw  she sat  long time  her cheek  her hand looking   fire “what  you supposing sara”  asked sara looked up   bright color  her cheeks “i  supposing” she said “i  remembering  hungry day   child i saw” “but there   great many hungry days” said  indian gentleman   rather sad tone  his voice “which hungry day  it” “i forgot you didnt know” said sara “it   day i found  things  my garret” and then she told him  story   bunshop   fourpence   child who  hungrier than herself  somehow  she told it though she told  very simply indeed  indian gentleman found  necessary  shade his eyes  his hand  look down   floor “and i  supposing  kind  plan” said sara when she had finished “i  thinking i would like  do something” “what  it” said her guardian   low tone “you may do anything you like  do princess” “i  wondering” said sara“you know you say i have  great deal  moneyand i  wondering if i could go  see  bunwoman  tell her  if when hungry childrenparticularly  those dreadful dayscome  sit   steps or look    window she would just call them   give them something  eat she might send  bills  me  i would pay themcould i do that” “you shall do  tomorrow morning” said  indian gentleman “thank you” said sara “you see i know what     hungry    very hard when one cant even pretend  away” “yes yes my dear” said  indian gentleman “yes  must be try  forget it come  sit  this footstool near my knee  only remember you   princess” “yes” said sara “and i can give buns  bread   populace” and she went  sat   stool   indian gentleman he used  like her  call him that too sometimesin fact very often drew her small dark head down upon his knee  stroked her hair the next morning  carriage drew up before  door   bakers shop   gentleman   little girl got outoddly enough just   bunwoman  putting  tray  smoking hotbuns into  window when sara entered  shop  woman turned  looked  her and leaving  buns came  stood behind  counter for  moment she looked  sara very hard indeed  then her goodnatured face lighted up “im  sure i remember you miss” she said “and yet” “yes” said sara “once you gave me six buns  fourpence and” “and you gave five  em   beggarchild” said  woman “ive always remembered it i couldnt make  out  first i beg pardon sir but theres not many young people  notices  hungry face   way  ive thought   many  time excuse  liberty miss but you look rosier  better than you did  day” “i am better thank you” said sara “andand i am happier  i have come  ask you  do something  me” “me miss” exclaimed  woman “why bless you yes miss what can i do” and then sara made her little proposal   woman listened     astonished face “why bless me” she said when she had heard  all “yes miss itll   pleasure  me  do it i am  working woman myself  cant afford  do much  my own account  theres sights  trouble  every side but if youll excuse me im bound  say ive given many  bit  bread away since  wet afternoon just along o thinkin  you an how wet an cold you was an how you lookedan yet you give away your hot buns  if you   princess” the indian gentleman smiled involuntarily  sara smiled  little too “she looked so hungry” she said “she  hungrier than i was” “she  starving” said  woman “manys  time shes told me   sincehow she sat there   wet  felt  if  wolf  atearing  her poor young insides” “oh have you seen her since then” exclaimed sara “do you know where she is” “i know” said  woman “why shes   there back room now miss an  been   month an  decent wellmeaning girl shes going  turn out an such  help  me   day shop an   kitchen  youd scarce believe knowing how shes lived” she stepped   door   little back parlor  spoke   next minute  girl came out  followed her behind  counter and actually    beggarchild clean  neatly clothed  looking  if she had not been hungry   long time she looked shy but she had  nice face now  she  no longer  savage   wild look had gone  her eyes and she knew sara   instant  stood  looked  her  if she could never look enough “you see” said  woman “i told her  come here when she  hungry  when shed come id give her odd jobs  do an i found she  willing an somehow i got  like her an  end    ive given her  place an  home an she helps me an behaves  well an   thankful   girl can be her names anneshe  no other” the two children stood  looked  each other  few moments in saras eyes  new thought  growing “im glad you have such  good home” she said “perhaps mrs brown  let you give  buns  bread   childrenperhaps you would like  do itbecause you know what     hungry too” “yes miss” said  girl and somehow sara felt  if she understood her though  girl said nothing more  only stood still  looked  looked after her  she went out   shop  got into  carriage  drove away end   project gutenberg ebook  sara crewe  frances hodgson burnett  end of this
