grow up   way wendy knew  this one day when she  two years old she  playing   garden  she plucked another flower  ran    her mother i suppose she must have looked rather delightful  mrs darling put her hand  her heart  cried “oh why can’t you remain like this  ever” this  all  passed between them   subject but henceforth wendy knew  she must grow up you always know after you  two two   beginning   end of course they lived    until wendy came her mother   chief one she   lovely lady   romantic mind  such  sweet mocking mouth her romantic mind  like  tiny boxes one within  other  come   puzzling east however many you discover there  always one more  her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss    wendy could never get though there  was perfectly conspicuous   righthand corner the way mr darling won her  this  many gentlemen who had been boys when she   girl discovered simultaneously  they loved her  they all ran  her house  propose  her except mr darling who took  cab  nipped  first  so  got her he got all  her except  innermost box   kiss he never knew about  box   time  gave up trying   kiss wendy thought napoleon could have got it but i can picture him trying  then going off   passion slamming  door mr darling used  boast  wendy  her mother not only loved him but respected him he  one  those deep ones who know about stocks  shares of course no one really knows but  quite seemed  know   often said stocks  up  shares  down   way  would have made any woman respect him mrs darling  married  white   first she kept  books perfectly almost gleefully  if    game not so much   brussels sprout  missing but    whole cauliflowers dropped out  instead  them there  pictures  babies without faces she drew them when she should have been totting up they  mrs darling’s guesses wendy came first then john then michael for  week or two after wendy came   doubtful whether they would  able  keep her  she  another mouth  feed mr darling  frightfully proud  her but   very honourable   sat   edge  mrs darling’s bed holding her hand  calculating expenses while she looked  him imploringly she wanted  risk it come what might but   not his way his way    pencil   piece  paper  if she confused him  suggestions  had  begin   beginning again “now don’t interrupt”  would beg  her “i have one pound seventeen here  two  six   office i can cut off my coffee   office say ten shillings making two nine  six  your eighteen  three makes three nine seven  five naught naught  my chequebook makes eight nine seven—who   moving—eight nine seven dot  carry seven—don’t speak my own—and  pound you lent   man who came   door—quiet child—dot  carry child—there you’ve done it—did i say nine nine seven yes i said nine nine seven  question is can we try    year  nine nine seven” “of course we can george” she cried but she  prejudiced  wendy’s favour    really  grander character   two “remember mumps”  warned her almost threateningly  off  went again “mumps one pound   what i have put down but i daresay    more like thirty shillings—don’t speak—measles one five german measles half  guinea makes two fifteen six—don’t waggle your finger—whoopingcough say fifteen shillings”—and so   went   added up differently each time but  last wendy just got through  mumps reduced  twelve six   two kinds  measles treated  one there   same excitement over john  michael had even  narrower squeak but both  kept  soon you might have seen  three  them going   row  miss fulsom’s kindergarten school accompanied  their nurse mrs darling loved  have everything just so  mr darling had  passion  being exactly like his neighbours so  course they had  nurse as they  poor owing   amount  milk  children drank this nurse   prim newfoundland dog called nana who had belonged  no one  particular until  darlings engaged her she had always thought children important however   darlings had become acquainted  her  kensington gardens where she spent most  her spare time peeping into perambulators   much hated  careless nursemaids whom she followed  their homes  complained   their mistresses she proved   quite  treasure   nurse how thorough she   bathtime  up  any moment   night if one  her charges made  slightest cry of course her kennel    nursery she had  genius  knowing when  cough   thing  have no patience   when  needs stocking around your throat she believed  her last day  oldfashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf  made sounds  contempt over all this newfangled talk about germs  so on it   lesson  propriety  see her escorting  children  school walking sedately  their side when they  well behaved  butting them back into line if they strayed on john’s footer days she never once forgot his sweater  she usually carried  umbrella  her mouth  case  rain there   room   basement  miss fulsom’s school where  nurses wait they sat  forms while nana lay   floor but    only difference they affected  ignore her    inferior social status  themselves  she despised their light talk she resented visits   nursery  mrs darling’s friends but if they did come she first whipped off michael’s pinafore  put him into  one  blue braiding  smoothed out wendy  made  dash  john’s hair no nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly  mr darling knew it yet  sometimes wondered uneasily whether  neighbours talked he had his position   city  consider nana also troubled him  another way he had sometimes  feeling  she did not admire him “i know she admires you tremendously george” mrs darling would assure him  then she would sign   children   specially nice  father lovely dances followed  which  only other servant liza  sometimes allowed  join such  midget she looked  her long skirt  maid’s cap though she had sworn when engaged  she would never see ten again the gaiety  those romps and gayest  all  mrs darling who would pirouette so wildly  all you could see  her   kiss  then if you had dashed  her you might have got it there never   simpler happier family until  coming  peter pan mrs darling first heard  peter when she  tidying up her children’s minds it   nightly custom  every good mother after her children  asleep  rummage  their minds  put things straight  next morning repacking into their proper places  many articles  have wandered during  day if you could keep awake but  course you can’t you would see your own mother doing this  you would find  very interesting  watch her it  quite like tidying up drawers you would see her  her knees i expect lingering humorously over some  your contents wondering where  earth you had picked this thing up making discoveries sweet  not so sweet pressing this  her cheek  if    nice   kitten  hurriedly stowing  out  sight when you wake   morning  naughtiness  evil passions  which you went  bed have been folded up small  placed   bottom  your mind    top beautifully aired  spread out your prettier thoughts ready  you  put on i don’t know whether you have ever seen  map   person’s mind doctors sometimes draw maps  other parts  you  your own map can become intensely interesting but catch them trying  draw  map   child’s mind which  not only confused but keeps going round all  time there  zigzag lines  it just like your temperature   card  these  probably roads   island   neverland  always more or less  island  astonishing splashes  colour here  there  coral reefs  rakishlooking craft   offing  savages  lonely lairs  gnomes who  mostly tailors  caves through which  river runs  princes  six elder brothers   hut fast going  decay  one very small old lady   hooked nose it would   easy map if   all but there  also first day  school religion fathers  round pond needlework murders hangings verbs  take  dative chocolate pudding day getting into braces say ninetynine threepence  pulling out your tooth yourself  so on  either these  part   island or they  another map showing through    all rather confusing especially  nothing  stand still of course  neverlands vary  good deal john’s  instance had  lagoon  flamingoes flying over   which john  shooting while michael who  very small had  flamingo  lagoons flying over it john lived   boat turned upside down   sands michael   wigwam wendy   house  leaves deftly sewn together john had no friends michael had friends  night wendy had  pet wolf forsaken   parents but   whole  neverlands have  family resemblance  if they stood still   row you could say  them  they have each other’s nose  so forth on these magic shores children  play   ever beaching their coracles we too have been there we can still hear  sound   surf though we shall land no more of all delectable islands  neverland   snuggest  most compact not large  sprawly you know  tedious distances between one adventure  another but nicely crammed when you play    day   chairs  tablecloth   not   least alarming but   two minutes before you go  sleep  becomes very real that  why there  nightlights occasionally  her travels through her children’s minds mrs darling found things she could not understand   these quite  most perplexing   word peter she knew  no peter  yet   here  there  john  michael’s minds while wendy’s began   scrawled all over  him the name stood out  bolder letters than any   other words   mrs darling gazed she felt   had  oddly cocky appearance “yes   rather cocky” wendy admitted  regret her mother had been questioning her “but who  he my pet” “he  peter pan you know mother” at first mrs darling did not know but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered  peter pan who  said  live   fairies there  odd stories about him   when children died  went part   way  them so  they should not  frightened she had believed  him   time but now  she  married  full  sense she quite doubted whether there  any such person “besides” she said  wendy “he would  grown up  this time” “oh no  isn’t grown up” wendy assured her confidently “and   just my size” she meant    her size  both mind  body she didn’t know how she knew she just knew it mrs darling consulted mr darling but  smiled poohpooh “mark my words”  said “it  some nonsense nana  been putting into their heads just  sort  idea  dog would have leave  alone    blow over” but  would not blow over  soon  troublesome boy gave mrs darling quite  shock children have  strangest adventures without being troubled  them for instance they may remember  mention  week after  event happened  when they    wood they had met their dead father  had  game  him it   this casual way  wendy one morning made  disquieting revelation some leaves   tree had been found   nursery floor which certainly  not there when  children went  bed  mrs darling  puzzling over them when wendy said   tolerant smile “i do believe    peter again” “whatever do you mean wendy” “it  so naughty  him not  wipe his feet” wendy said sighing she   tidy child she explained  quite  matteroffact way  she thought peter sometimes came   nursery   night  sat   foot  her bed  played  his pipes  her unfortunately she never woke so she didn’t know how she knew she just knew “what nonsense you talk precious no one can get into  house without knocking” “i think  comes    window” she said “my love   three floors up” “were not  leaves   foot   window mother” it  quite true  leaves had been found very near  window mrs darling did not know what  think   all seemed so natural  wendy  you could not dismiss   saying she had been dreaming “my child”  mother cried “why did you not tell me  this before” “i forgot” said wendy lightly she    hurry  get her breakfast oh surely she must have been dreaming but   other hand there   leaves mrs darling examined them very carefully they  skeleton leaves but she  sure they did not come  any tree  grew  england she crawled about  floor peering     candle  marks   strange foot she rattled  poker up  chimney  tapped  walls she let down  tape   window   pavement     sheer drop  thirty feet without so much   spout  climb up by certainly wendy had been dreaming but wendy had not been dreaming   very next night showed  night  which  extraordinary adventures  these children may  said  have begun on  night we speak  all  children  once more  bed it happened   nana’s evening off  mrs darling had bathed them  sung  them till one  one they had let go her hand  slid away into  land  sleep all  looking so safe  cosy  she smiled  her fears now  sat down tranquilly   fire  sew it  something  michael who  his birthday  getting into shirts the fire  warm however   nursery dimly lit  three nightlights  presently  sewing lay  mrs darling’s lap then her head nodded oh so gracefully she  asleep look   four  them wendy  michael over there john here  mrs darling   fire there should have been  fourth nightlight while she slept she had  dream she dreamt   neverland had come too near    strange boy had broken through  it he did not alarm her  she thought she had seen him before   faces  many women who have no children perhaps     found   faces  some mothers also but  her dream  had rent  film  obscures  neverland  she saw wendy  john  michael peeping through  gap the dream  itself would have been  trifle but while she  dreaming  window   nursery blew open   boy did drop   floor he  accompanied   strange light no bigger than your fist which darted about  room like  living thing  i think  must have been this light  wakened mrs darling she started up   cry  saw  boy  somehow she knew  once    peter pan if you or i or wendy had been there we should have seen    very like mrs darling’s kiss he   lovely boy clad  skeleton leaves   juices  ooze out  trees but  most entrancing thing about him    had all his first teeth when  saw she   grownup  gnashed  little pearls  her chapter ii the shadow mrs darling screamed and  if  answer   bell  door opened  nana entered returned  her evening out she growled  sprang   boy who leapt lightly through  window again mrs darling screamed this time  distress  him  she thought   killed  she ran down into  street  look  his little body but   not there  she looked up    black night she could see nothing but what she thought   shooting star she returned   nursery  found nana  something  her mouth which proved    boy’s shadow as  leapt   window nana had closed  quickly too late  catch him but his shadow had not had time  get out slam went  window  snapped  off you may  sure mrs darling examined  shadow carefully but   quite  ordinary kind nana had no doubt  what   best thing  do  this shadow she hung  out   window meaning “he  sure  come back  it let us put  where  can get  easily without disturbing  children” but unfortunately mrs darling could not leave  hanging out   window  looked so like  washing  lowered  whole tone   house she thought  showing   mr darling but   totting up winter greatcoats  john  michael   wet towel around his head  keep his brain clear   seemed  shame  trouble him besides she knew exactly what  would say “it all comes  having  dog   nurse” she decided  roll  shadow up  put  away carefully   drawer until  fitting opportunity came  telling her husband ah me the opportunity came  week later   nevertobeforgotten friday of course    friday “i ought  have been specially careful   friday” she used  say afterwards  her husband while perhaps nana    other side  her holding her hand “no no” mr darling always said “i am responsible   all i george darling did it mea culpa mea culpa” he had had  classical education they sat thus night after night recalling  fatal friday till every detail    stamped  their brains  came through   other side like  faces   bad coinage “if only i had not accepted  invitation  dine  ” mrs darling said “if only i had not poured my medicine into nana’s bowl” said mr darling “if only i had pretended  like  medicine”  what nana’s wet eyes said “my liking  parties george” “my fatal gift  humour dearest” “my touchiness about trifles dear master  mistress” then one or more  them would break down altogether nana   thought “it’s true it’s true they ought not  have had  dog   nurse” many  time   mr darling who put  handkerchief  nana’s eyes “that fiend” mr darling would cry  nana’s bark   echo  it but mrs darling never upbraided peter there  something   righthand corner  her mouth  wanted her not  call peter names they would sit there   empty nursery recalling fondly every smallest detail   dreadful evening it had begun so uneventfully so precisely like  hundred other evenings  nana putting   water  michael’s bath  carrying him    her back “i won’t go  bed”  had shouted like one who still believed   had  last word   subject “i won’t i won’t nana  isn’t six o’clock yet oh dear oh dear i shan’t love you any more nana i tell you i won’t  bathed i won’t i won’t” then mrs darling had come in wearing her white eveninggown she had dressed early because wendy so loved  see her  her eveninggown   necklace george had given her she  wearing wendy’s bracelet  her arm she had asked   loan  it wendy loved  lend her bracelet  her mother she had found her two older children playing  being herself  father   occasion  wendy’s birth  john  saying “i am happy  inform you mrs darling  you  now  mother”  just such  tone  mr darling himself may have used   real occasion wendy had danced  joy just   real mrs darling must have done then john  born   extra pomp   conceived due   birth   male  michael came  his bath  ask   born also but john said brutally  they did not want any more michael had nearly cried “nobody wants me”  said   course  lady   eveningdress could not stand that “i do” she said “i so want  third child” “boy or girl” asked michael not too hopefully “boy” then  had leapt into her arms such  little thing  mr  mrs darling  nana  recall now but not so little if     michael’s last night   nursery they go   their recollections “it  then  i rushed  like  tornado wasn’t it” mr darling would say scorning himself  indeed  had been like  tornado perhaps there  some excuse  him he too had been dressing   party  all had gone well  him until  came  his tie it   astounding thing  have  tell but this man though  knew about stocks  shares had no real mastery  his tie sometimes  thing yielded  him without  contest but there  occasions when  would have been better   house if  had swallowed his pride  used  madeup tie this  such  occasion he came rushing into  nursery   crumpled little brute   tie  his hand “why what   matter father dear” “matter”  yelled  really yelled “this tie   not tie” he became dangerously sarcastic “not round my neck round  bedpost oh yes twenty times have i made  up round  bedpost but round my neck no oh dear no begs   excused” he thought mrs darling  not sufficiently impressed   went  sternly “i warn you  this mother  unless this tie  round my neck we don’t go out  dinner tonight  if i don’t go out  dinner tonight i never go   office again  if i don’t go   office again you  i starve  our children   flung into  streets” even then mrs darling  placid “let me try dear” she said  indeed   what  had come  ask her  do   her nice cool hands she tied his tie  him while  children stood around  see their fate decided some men would have resented her being able  do  so easily but mr darling had far too fine  nature  that  thanked her carelessly  once forgot his rage   another moment  dancing round  room  michael  his back “how wildly we romped” says mrs darling now recalling it “our last romp” mr darling groaned “o george do you remember michael suddenly said  me ‘how did you get  know me mother’” “i remember” “they  rather sweet don’t you think george” “and they  ours ours  now they  gone” the romp had ended   appearance  nana  most unluckily mr darling collided against her covering his trousers  hairs they  not only new trousers but they   first  had ever had  braid  them   had had  bite his lip  prevent  tears coming of course mrs darling brushed him but  began  talk again about  being  mistake  have  dog   nurse “george nana   treasure” “no doubt but i have  uneasy feeling  times  she looks upon  children  puppies” “oh no dear one i feel sure she knows they have souls” “i wonder” mr darling said thoughtfully “i wonder” it   opportunity his wife felt  telling him about  boy at first  poohpoohed  story but  became thoughtful when she showed him  shadow “it  nobody i know”  said examining  carefully “but  does look  scoundrel” “we  still discussing it you remember” says mr darling “when nana came   michael’s medicine you  never carry  bottle  your mouth again nana    all my fault” strong man though  was there  no doubt   had behaved rather foolishly over  medicine if  had  weakness    thinking  all his life  had taken medicine boldly  so now when michael dodged  spoon  nana’s mouth  had said reprovingly “be  man michael” “won’t won’t” michael cried naughtily mrs darling left  room  get  chocolate  him  mr darling thought this showed want  firmness “mother don’t pamper him”  called after her “michael when i  your age i took medicine without  murmur i said ‘thank you kind parents  giving me bottles  make me well’” he really thought this  true  wendy who  now  her nightgown believed  also  she said  encourage michael “that medicine you sometimes take father  much nastier isn’t it” “ever so much nastier” mr darling said bravely “and i would take  now   example  you michael if i hadn’t lost  bottle” he had not exactly lost it  had climbed   dead  night   top   wardrobe  hidden  there what  did not know    faithful liza had found it  put  back  his washstand “i know where  is father” wendy cried always glad    service “i’ll bring it”  she  off before  could stop her immediately his spirits sank   strangest way “john”  said shuddering “it’s most beastly stuff it’s  nasty sticky sweet kind” “it  soon  over father” john said cheerily  then  rushed wendy   medicine   glass “i have been  quick  i could” she panted “you have been wonderfully quick” her father retorted   vindictive politeness   quite thrown away upon her “michael first”  said doggedly “father first” said michael who    suspicious nature “i shall  sick you know” mr darling said threateningly “come on father” said john “hold your tongue john” his father rapped out wendy  quite puzzled “i thought you took  quite easily father” “that  not  point”  retorted “the point is  there  more  my glass than  michael’s spoon” his proud heart  nearly bursting “and  isn’t fair i would say  though    my last breath  isn’t fair” “father i am waiting” said michael coldly “it’s all very well  say you  waiting so am i waiting” “father’s  cowardly custard” “so  you  cowardly custard” “i’m not frightened” “neither am i frightened” “well then take it” “well then you take it” wendy had  splendid idea “why not both take    same time” “certainly” said mr darling “are you ready michael” wendy gave  words one two three  michael took his medicine but mr darling slipped his behind his back there   yell  rage  michael  “o father” wendy exclaimed “what do you mean  ‘o father’” mr darling demanded “stop  row michael i meant  take mine but i—i missed it” it  dreadful  way all  three  looking  him just  if they did not admire him “look here all  you”  said entreatingly  soon  nana had gone into  bathroom “i have just thought   splendid joke i shall pour my medicine into nana’s bowl  she  drink it thinking   milk” it   colour  milk but  children did not have their father’s sense  humour  they looked  him reproachfully   poured  medicine into nana’s bowl “what fun”  said doubtfully  they did not dare expose him when mrs darling  nana returned “nana good dog”  said patting her “i have put  little milk into your bowl nana” nana wagged her tail ran   medicine  began lapping it then she gave mr darling such  look not  angry look she showed him  great red tear  makes us so sorry  noble dogs  crept into her kennel mr darling  frightfully ashamed  himself but  would not give in in  horrid silence mrs darling smelt  bowl “o george” she said “it’s your medicine” “it  only  joke”  roared while she comforted her boys  wendy hugged nana “much good”  said bitterly “my wearing myself   bone trying   funny  this house” and still wendy hugged nana “that’s right”  shouted “coddle her nobody coddles me oh dear no i am only  breadwinner why should i  coddled—why why why” “george” mrs darling entreated him “not so loud  servants  hear you” somehow they had got into  way  calling liza  servants “let them”  answered recklessly “bring   whole world but i refuse  allow  dog  lord   my nursery   hour longer” the children wept  nana ran  him beseechingly but  waved her back he felt    strong man again “in vain  vain”  cried “the proper place  you   yard  there you go   tied up this instant” “george george” mrs darling whispered “remember what i told you about  boy” alas  would not listen he  determined  show who  master   house  when commands would not draw nana   kennel  lured her out    honeyed words  seizing her roughly dragged her   nursery he  ashamed  himself  yet  did it it  all owing  his too affectionate nature which craved  admiration when  had tied her up   backyard  wretched father went  sat   passage  his knuckles  his eyes in  meantime mrs darling had put  children  bed  unwonted silence  lit their nightlights they could hear nana barking  john whimpered “it  because   chaining her up   yard” but wendy  wiser “that  not nana’s unhappy bark” she said little guessing what  about  happen “that  her bark when she smells danger” danger “are you sure wendy” “oh yes” mrs darling quivered  went   window it  securely fastened she looked out   night  peppered  stars they  crowding round  house  if curious  see what   take place there but she did not notice this nor  one or two   smaller ones winked  her yet  nameless fear clutched  her heart  made her cry “oh how i wish  i wasn’t going   party tonight” even michael already half asleep knew  she  perturbed   asked “can anything harm us mother after  nightlights  lit” “nothing precious” she said “they   eyes  mother leaves behind her  guard her children” she went  bed  bed singing enchantments over them  little michael flung his arms round her “mother”  cried “i’m glad  you” they   last words she   hear  him   long time no   only  few yards distant but there had been  slight fall  snow  father  mother darling picked their way over  deftly not  soil their shoes they  already  only persons   street  all  stars  watching them stars  beautiful but they may not take  active part  anything they must just look   ever it   punishment put  them  something they did so long ago  no star now knows what  was so  older ones have become glassyeyed  seldom speak winking   star language but  little ones still wonder they  not really friendly  peter who had  mischievous way  stealing up behind them  trying  blow them out but they  so fond  fun  they   his side tonight  anxious  get  grownups out   way so  soon   door   closed  mr  mrs darling there   commotion   firmament   smallest  all  stars   milky way screamed out “now peter” chapter iii come away come away for  moment after mr  mrs darling left  house  nightlights   beds   three children continued  burn clearly they  awfully nice little nightlights  one cannot help wishing  they could have kept awake  see peter but wendy’s light blinked  gave such  yawn   other two yawned also  before they could close their mouths all  three went out there  another light   room now  thousand times brighter than  nightlights    time we have taken  say this  had been  all  drawers   nursery looking  peter’s shadow rummaged  wardrobe  turned every pocket inside out it  not really  light  made this light  flashing about so quickly but when  came  rest   second you saw    fairy no longer than your hand but still growing it   girl called tinker bell exquisitely gowned   skeleton leaf cut low  square through which her figure could  seen   best advantage she  slightly inclined  embonpoint a moment after  fairy’s entrance  window  blown open   breathing   little stars  peter dropped in he had carried tinker bell part   way  his hand  still messy   fairy dust “tinker bell”  called softly after making sure   children  asleep “tink where  you” she    jug   moment  liking  extremely she had never been   jug before “oh do come out   jug  tell me do you know where they put my shadow” the loveliest tinkle   golden bells answered him it   fairy language you ordinary children can never hear it but if you   hear  you would know  you had heard  once before tink said   shadow    big box she meant  chest  drawers  peter jumped   drawers scattering their contents   floor  both hands  kings toss ha’pence   crowd in  moment  had recovered his shadow   his delight  forgot   had shut tinker bell up   drawer if  thought  all but i don’t believe  ever thought      his shadow when brought near each other would join like drops  water  when they did not   appalled he tried  stick    soap   bathroom but  also failed a shudder passed through peter   sat   floor  cried his sobs woke wendy  she sat up  bed she  not alarmed  see  stranger crying   nursery floor she  only pleasantly interested “boy” she said courteously “why  you crying” peter could  exceeding polite also having learned  grand manner  fairy ceremonies   rose  bowed  her beautifully she  much pleased  bowed beautifully  him   bed “what’s your name”  asked “wendy moira angela darling” she replied  some satisfaction “what  your name” “peter pan” she  already sure   must  peter but  did seem  comparatively short name “is  all” “yes”  said rather sharply he felt   first time     shortish name “i’m so sorry” said wendy moira angela “it doesn’t matter” peter gulped she asked where  lived “second   right” said peter “and then straight  till morning” “what  funny address” peter had  sinking for  first time  felt  perhaps    funny address “no  isn’t”  said “i mean” wendy said nicely remembering  she  hostess “is  what they put   letters” he wished she had not mentioned letters “don’t get any letters”  said contemptuously “but your mother gets letters” “don’t have  mother”  said not only had  no mother but  had not  slightest desire  have one he thought them very overrated persons wendy however felt  once  she    presence   tragedy “o peter no wonder you  crying” she said  got out  bed  ran  him “i wasn’t crying about mothers”  said rather indignantly “i  crying because i can’t get my shadow  stick on besides i wasn’t crying” “it  come off” “yes” then wendy saw  shadow   floor looking so draggled  she  frightfully sorry  peter “how awful” she said but she could not help smiling when she saw   had been trying  stick    soap how exactly like  boy fortunately she knew  once what  do “it must  sewn on” she said just  little patronisingly “what’s sewn”  asked “you’re dreadfully ignorant” “no i’m not” but she  exulting  his ignorance “i shall sew    you my little man” she said though   tall  herself  she got out her housewife  sewed  shadow   peter’s foot “i daresay   hurt  little” she warned him “oh i shan’t cry” said peter who  already   opinion   had never cried  his life and  clenched his teeth  did not cry  soon his shadow  behaving properly though still  little creased “perhaps i should have ironed it” wendy said thoughtfully but peter boylike  indifferent  appearances    now jumping about   wildest glee alas  had already forgotten   owed his bliss  wendy he thought  had attached  shadow himself “how clever i am”  crowed rapturously “oh  cleverness  me” it  humiliating  have  confess  this conceit  peter  one  his most fascinating qualities to put   brutal frankness there never   cockier boy but   moment wendy  shocked “you conceit” she exclaimed  frightful sarcasm “of course i did nothing” “you did  little” peter said carelessly  continued  dance “a little” she replied  hauteur “if i am no use i can  least withdraw”  she sprang   most dignified way into bed  covered her face   blankets to induce her  look up  pretended   going away  when this failed  sat   end   bed  tapped her gently  his foot “wendy”  said “don’t withdraw i can’t help crowing wendy when i’m pleased  myself” still she would not look up though she  listening eagerly “wendy”  continued   voice  no woman  ever yet been able  resist “wendy one girl  more use than twenty boys” now wendy  every inch  woman though there  not very many inches  she peeped out   bedclothes “do you really think so peter” “yes i do” “i think it’s perfectly sweet  you” she declared “and i’ll get up again”  she sat  him   side   bed she also said she would give him  kiss if  liked but peter did not know what she meant   held out his hand expectantly “surely you know what  kiss is” she asked aghast “i shall know when you give   me”  replied stiffly  not  hurt his feeling she gave him  thimble “now” said he “shall i give you  kiss”  she replied   slight primness “if you please” she made herself rather cheap  inclining her face toward him but  merely dropped  acorn button into her hand so she slowly returned her face  where  had been before  said nicely  she would wear his kiss   chain around her neck it  lucky  she did put    chain    afterwards  save her life when people  our set  introduced   customary  them  ask each other’s age  so wendy who always liked  do  correct thing asked peter how old  was it  not really  happy question  ask him   like  examination paper  asks grammar when what you want   asked  kings  england “i don’t know”  replied uneasily “but i am quite young” he really knew nothing about it  had merely suspicions but  said   venture “wendy i ran away  day i  born” wendy  quite surprised but interested  she indicated   charming drawingroom manner   touch  her nightgown   could sit nearer her “it  because i heard father  mother”  explained   low voice “talking about what i    when i became  man” he  extraordinarily agitated now “i don’t want ever    man”  said  passion “i want always    little boy   have fun so i ran away  kensington gardens  lived  long long time among  fairies” she gave him  look   most intense admiration   thought   because  had run away but   really because  knew fairies wendy had lived such  home life   know fairies struck her  quite delightful she poured out questions about them  his surprise  they  rather  nuisance  him getting  his way  so on  indeed  sometimes had  give them  hiding still  liked them   whole   told her about  beginning  fairies “you see wendy when  first baby laughed   first time  laugh broke into  thousand pieces  they all went skipping about     beginning  fairies” tedious talk this but being  stayathome she liked it “and so”  went  goodnaturedly “there ought   one fairy  every boy  girl” “ought  be isn’t there” “no you see children know such  lot now they soon don’t believe  fairies  every time  child says ‘i don’t believe  fairies’ there   fairy somewhere  falls down dead” really  thought they had now talked enough about fairies   struck him  tinker bell  keeping very quiet “i can’t think where she  gone to”  said rising   called tink  name wendy’s heart went flutter   sudden thrill “peter” she cried clutching him “you don’t mean  tell me  there   fairy  this room” “she  here just now”  said  little impatiently “you don’t hear her do you”  they both listened “the only sound i hear” said wendy “is like  tinkle  bells” “well that’s tink that’s  fairy language i think i hear her too” the sound came   chest  drawers  peter made  merry face no one could ever look quite so merry  peter   loveliest  gurgles  his laugh he had his first laugh still “wendy”  whispered gleefully “i do believe i shut her up   drawer” he let poor tink out   drawer  she flew about  nursery screaming  fury “you shouldn’t say such things” peter retorted “of course i’m very sorry but how could i know you    drawer” wendy  not listening  him “o peter” she cried “if she would only stand still  let me see her” “they hardly ever stand still”  said but  one moment wendy saw  romantic figure come  rest   cuckoo clock “o  lovely” she cried though tink’s face  still distorted  passion “tink” said peter amiably “this lady says she wishes you  her fairy” tinker bell answered insolently “what does she say peter” he had  translate “she  not very polite she says you   great ugly girl   she  my fairy” he tried  argue  tink “you know you can’t  my fairy tink because i am  gentleman  you   lady” to this tink replied  these words “you silly ass”  disappeared into  bathroom “she  quite  common fairy” peter explained apologetically “she  called tinker bell because she mends  pots  kettles” they  together   armchair  this time  wendy plied him  more questions “if you don’t live  kensington gardens now—” “sometimes i do still” “but where do you live mostly now” “with  lost boys” “who  they” “they   children who fall out  their perambulators when  nurse  looking  other way if they  not claimed  seven days they  sent far away   neverland  defray expenses i’m captain” “what fun  must be” “yes” said cunning peter “but we  rather lonely you see we have no female companionship” “are none   others girls” “oh no girls you know  much too clever  fall out  their prams” this flattered wendy immensely “i think” she said “it  perfectly lovely  way you talk about girls john there just despises us” for reply peter rose  kicked john out  bed blankets  all one kick this seemed  wendy rather forward   first meeting  she told him  spirit    not captain  her house however john continued  sleep so placidly   floor  she allowed him  remain there “and i know you meant   kind” she said relenting “so you may give me  kiss” for  moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses “i thought you would want  back”  said  little bitterly  offered  return her  thimble “oh dear” said  nice wendy “i don’t mean  kiss i mean  thimble” “what’s that” “it’s like this” she kissed him “funny” said peter gravely “now shall i give you  thimble” “if you wish to” said wendy keeping her head erect this time peter thimbled her  almost immediately she screeched “what  it wendy” “it  exactly  if someone  pulling my hair” “that must have been tink i never knew her so naughty before” and indeed tink  darting about again using offensive language “she says she  do   you wendy every time i give you  thimble” “but why” “why tink” again tink replied “you silly ass” peter could not understand why but wendy understood  she  just slightly disappointed when  admitted   came   nursery window not  see her but  listen  stories “you see i don’t know any stories none   lost boys knows any stories” “how perfectly awful” wendy said “do you know” peter asked “why swallows build   eaves  houses it   listen   stories o wendy your mother  telling you such  lovely story” “which story  it” “about  prince who couldn’t find  lady who wore  glass slipper” “peter” said wendy excitedly “that  cinderella   found her  they lived happily ever after” peter  so glad   rose   floor where they had been sitting  hurried   window “where  you going” she cried  misgiving “to tell  other boys” “don’t go peter” she entreated “i know such lots  stories” those  her precise words so there can  no denying    she who first tempted him he came back  there   greedy look  his eyes now which ought  have alarmed her but did not “oh  stories i could tell   boys” she cried  then peter gripped her  began  draw her toward  window “let me go” she ordered him “wendy do come  me  tell  other boys” of course she  very pleased   asked but she said “oh dear i can’t think  mummy besides i can’t fly” “i’ll teach you” “oh how lovely  fly” “i’ll teach you how  jump   wind’s back  then away we go” “oo” she exclaimed rapturously “wendy wendy when you  sleeping  your silly bed you might  flying about  me saying funny things   stars” “oo” “and wendy there  mermaids” “mermaids with tails” “such long tails” “oh” cried wendy “to see  mermaid” he had become frightfully cunning “wendy”  said “how we should all respect you” she  wriggling her body  distress it  quite  if she  trying  remain   nursery floor but  had no pity  her “wendy”  said  sly one “you could tuck us   night” “oo” “none  us  ever been tucked   night” “oo”  her arms went out  him “and you could darn our clothes  make pockets  us none  us  any pockets” how could she resist “of course it’s awfully fascinating” she cried “peter would you teach john  michael  fly too” “if you like”  said indifferently  she ran  john  michael  shook them “wake up” she cried “peter pan  come     teach us  fly” john rubbed his eyes “then i shall get up”  said of course     floor already “hallo”  said “i am up” michael  up  this time also looking  sharp   knife  six blades   saw but peter suddenly signed silence their faces assumed  awful craftiness  children listening  sounds   grownup world all   still  salt then everything  right no stop everything  wrong nana who had been barking distressfully all  evening  quiet now it  her silence they had heard “out   light hide quick” cried john taking command   only time throughout  whole adventure and thus when liza entered holding nana  nursery seemed quite  old self very dark  you would have sworn you heard  three wicked inmates breathing angelically  they slept they  really doing  artfully  behind  window curtains liza    bad temper  she  mixing  christmas puddings   kitchen  had been drawn  them   raisin still  her cheek  nana’s absurd suspicions she thought  best way  getting  little quiet   take nana   nursery   moment but  custody  course “there you suspicious brute” she said not sorry  nana   disgrace “they  perfectly safe aren’t they every one   little angels sound asleep  bed listen  their gentle breathing” here michael encouraged  his success breathed so loudly  they  nearly detected nana knew  kind  breathing  she tried  drag herself out  liza’s clutches but liza  dense “no more  it nana” she said sternly pulling her out   room “i warn you if you bark again i shall go straight  master  missus  bring them home   party  then oh won’t master whip you just” she tied  unhappy dog up again but do you think nana ceased  bark bring master  missus home   party why   just what she wanted do you think she cared whether she  whipped so long  her charges  safe unfortunately liza returned  her puddings  nana seeing  no help would come  her strained  strained   chain until  last she broke it in another moment she had burst into  diningroom    flung up her paws  heaven her most expressive way  making  communication mr  mrs darling knew  once  something terrible  happening  their nursery  without  goodbye  their hostess they rushed into  street but   now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind  curtains  peter pan can do  great deal  ten minutes we now return   nursery “it’s all right” john announced emerging  his hidingplace “i say peter can you really fly” instead  troubling  answer him peter flew around  room taking  mantelpiece   way “how topping” said john  michael “how sweet” cried wendy “yes i’m sweet oh i am sweet” said peter forgetting his manners again it looked delightfully easy  they tried  first   floor  then   beds but they always went down instead  up “i say how do you do it” asked john rubbing his knee he  quite  practical boy “you just think lovely wonderful thoughts” peter explained “and they lift you up   air” he showed them again “you’re so nippy  it” john said “couldn’t you do  very slowly once” peter did  both slowly  quickly “i’ve got  now wendy” cried john but soon  found  had not not one  them could fly  inch though even michael   words  two syllables  peter did not know a  z of course peter had been trifling  them  no one can fly unless  fairy dust  been blown  him fortunately  we have mentioned one  his hands  messy  it   blew some  each  them   most superb results “now just wiggle your shoulders this way”  said “and let go” they  all  their beds  gallant michael let go first he did not quite mean  let go but  did it  immediately   borne across  room “i flewed”  screamed while still  midair john let go  met wendy near  bathroom “oh lovely” “oh ripping” “look  me” “look  me” “look  me” they  not nearly so elegant  peter they could not help kicking  little but their heads  bobbing against  ceiling  there  almost nothing so delicious  that peter gave wendy  hand  first but had  desist tink  so indignant up  down they went  round  round heavenly  wendy’s word “i say” cried john “why shouldn’t we all go out” of course    this  peter had been luring them michael  ready  wanted  see how long  took him  do  billion miles but wendy hesitated “mermaids” said peter again “oo” “and there  pirates” “pirates” cried john seizing his sunday hat “let us go  once” it  just  this moment  mr  mrs darling hurried  nana out   they ran into  middle   street  look up   nursery window and yes   still shut but  room  ablaze  light  most heartgripping sight  all they could see  shadow   curtain three little figures  night attire circling round  round not   floor but   air not three figures four in  tremble they opened  street door mr darling would have rushed upstairs but mrs darling signed him  go softly she even tried  make her heart go softly will they reach  nursery  time if so how delightful  them  we shall all breathe  sigh  relief but there   no story on  other hand if they  not  time i solemnly promise    all come right   end they would have reached  nursery  time had  not been   little stars  watching them once again  stars blew  window open   smallest star  all called out “cave peter” then peter knew  there  not  moment  lose “come”  cried imperiously  soared out  once into  night followed  john  michael  wendy mr  mrs darling  nana rushed into  nursery too late the birds  flown chapter iv the flight “second   right  straight  till morning” that peter had told wendy   way   neverland but even birds carrying maps  consulting them  windy corners could not have sighted   these instructions peter you see just said anything  came into his head at first his companions trusted him implicitly  so great   delights  flying  they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects   way  took their fancy john  michael raced michael getting  start they recalled  contempt  not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows  being able  fly round  room not long ago but how long ago they  flying over  sea before this thought began  disturb wendy seriously john thought   their second sea  their third night sometimes   dark  sometimes light  now they  very cold  again too warm did they really feel hungry  times or  they merely pretending because peter had such  jolly new way  feeding them his way   pursue birds who had food  their mouths suitable  humans  snatch   them then  birds would follow  snatch  back  they would all go chasing each other gaily  miles parting  last  mutual expressions  goodwill but wendy noticed  gentle concern  peter did not seem  know  this  rather  odd way  getting your bread  butter nor even  there  other ways certainly they did not pretend   sleepy they  sleepy     danger   moment they popped off down they fell the awful thing   peter thought this funny “there  goes again”  would cry gleefully  michael suddenly dropped like  stone “save him save him” cried wendy looking  horror   cruel sea far below eventually peter would dive through  air  catch michael just before  could strike  sea    lovely  way  did it but  always waited till  last moment  you felt   his cleverness  interested him  not  saving  human life also   fond  variety   sport  engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease  engage him so there  always  possibility   next time you fell  would let you go he could sleep   air without falling  merely lying  his back  floating but this was partly  least because   so light  if you got behind him  blew  went faster “do  more polite  him” wendy whispered  john when they  playing “follow my leader” “then tell him  stop showing off” said john when playing follow my leader peter would fly close   water  touch each shark’s tail  passing just    street you may run your finger along  iron railing they could not follow him  this  much success so perhaps   rather like showing off especially   kept looking behind  see how many tails they missed “you must  nice  him” wendy impressed  her brothers “what could we do if    leave us” “we could go back” michael said “how could we ever find our way back without him” “well then we could go on” said john “that   awful thing john we should have  go on  we don’t know how  stop” this  true peter had forgotten  show them how  stop john said  if  worst came   worst all they had  do   go straight on   world  round  so  time they must come back  their own window “and who   get food  us john” “i nipped  bit out   eagle’s mouth pretty neatly wendy” “after  twentieth try” wendy reminded him “and even though we became good  picking up food see how we bump against clouds  things if   not near  give us  hand” indeed they  constantly bumping they could now fly strongly though they still kicked far too much but if they saw  cloud  front  them  more they tried  avoid it  more certainly did they bump into it if nana had been  them she would have had  bandage round michael’s forehead  this time peter  not  them   moment  they felt rather lonely up there  themselves he could go so much faster than they   would suddenly shoot out  sight  have some adventure  which they had no share he would come down laughing over something fearfully funny  had been saying   star but  had already forgotten what  was or  would come up  mermaid scales still sticking  him  yet not  able  say  certain what had been happening it  really rather irritating  children who had never seen  mermaid “and if  forgets them so quickly” wendy argued “how can we expect    go  remembering us” indeed sometimes when  returned  did not remember them  least not well wendy  sure  it she saw recognition come into his eyes    about  pass them  time  day  go on once even she had  call him  name “i’m wendy” she said agitatedly he  very sorry “i say wendy”  whispered  her “always if you see me forgetting you just keep  saying ‘i’m wendy’  then i’ll remember” of course this  rather unsatisfactory however  make amends  showed them how  lie out flat   strong wind   going their way  this  such  pleasant change  they tried  several times  found  they could sleep thus  security indeed they would have slept longer but peter tired quickly  sleeping  soon  would cry  his captain voice “we get off here” so  occasional tiffs but   whole rollicking they drew near  neverland  after many moons they did reach it and what  more they had been going pretty straight all  time not perhaps so much owing   guidance  peter or tink  because  island  looking  them it  only thus  any one may sight those magic shores “there  is” said peter calmly “where where” “where all  arrows  pointing” indeed  million golden arrows  pointing  out   children all directed  their friend  sun who wanted them   sure  their way before leaving them   night wendy  john  michael stood  tiptoe   air  get their first sight   island strange  say they all recognized   once  until fear fell upon them they hailed it not  something long dreamt   seen  last but   familiar friend  whom they  returning home   holidays “john there’s  lagoon” “wendy look   turtles burying their eggs   sand” “i say john i see your flamingo   broken leg” “look michael there’s your cave” “john what’s    brushwood” “it’s  wolf  her whelps wendy i do believe that’s your little whelp” “there’s my boat john  her sides stove in” “no  isn’t why we burned your boat” “that’s her  any rate i say john i see  smoke   redskin camp” “where show me  i’ll tell you   way smoke curls whether they    warpath” “there just across  mysterious river” “i see now yes they    warpath right enough” peter   little annoyed  them  knowing so much but if  wanted  lord  over them his triumph   hand  have i not told you  anon fear fell upon them it came   arrows went leaving  island  gloom in  old days  home  neverland had always begun  look  little dark  threatening  bedtime then unexplored patches arose    spread black shadows moved about  them  roar   beasts  prey  quite different now  above all you lost  certainty  you would win you  quite glad   nightlights  on you even liked nana  say  this  just  mantelpiece over here    neverland  all makebelieve of course  neverland had been makebelieve  those days but   real now  there  no nightlights    getting darker every moment  where  nana they had been flying apart but they huddled close  peter now his careless manner had gone  last his eyes  sparkling   tingle went through them every time they touched his body they  now over  fearsome island flying so low  sometimes  tree grazed their feet nothing horrid  visible   air yet their progress had become slow  laboured exactly  if they  pushing their way through hostile forces sometimes they hung   air until peter had beaten    his fists “they don’t want us  land”  explained “who  they” wendy whispered shuddering but  could not or would not say tinker bell had been asleep  his shoulder but now  wakened her  sent her   front sometimes  poised himself   air listening intently  his hand  his ear  again  would stare down  eyes so bright  they seemed  bore two holes  earth having done these things  went  again his courage  almost appalling “would you like  adventure now”  said casually  john “or would you like  have your tea first” wendy said “tea first” quickly  michael pressed her hand  gratitude but  braver john hesitated “what kind  adventure”  asked cautiously “there’s  pirate asleep   pampas just beneath us” peter told him “if you like we’ll go down  kill him” “i don’t see him” john said after  long pause “i do” “suppose” john said  little huskily “he   wake up” peter spoke indignantly “you don’t think i would kill him while   sleeping i would wake him first  then kill him that’s  way i always do” “i say do you kill many” “tons” john said “how ripping” but decided  have tea first he asked if there  many pirates   island just now  peter said  had never known so many “who  captain now” “hook” answered peter  his face became very stern   said  hated word “jas hook” “ay” then indeed michael began  cry  even john could speak  gulps only  they knew hook’s reputation “he  blackbeard’s bo’sun” john whispered huskily “he   worst  them all he   only man  whom barbecue  afraid” “that’s him” said peter “what   like is  big” “he  not so big   was” “how do you mean” “i cut off  bit  him” “you” “yes me” said peter sharply “i wasn’t meaning   disrespectful” “oh all right” “but i say what bit” “his right hand” “then  can’t fight now” “oh can’t  just” “lefthander” “he   iron hook instead   right hand   claws  it” “claws” “i say john” said peter “yes” “say ‘ay ay sir’” “ay ay sir” “there  one thing” peter continued “that every boy who serves under me   promise  so must you” john paled “it  this if we meet hook  open fight you must leave him  me” “i promise” john said loyally for  moment they  feeling less eerie because tink  flying  them   her light they could distinguish each other unfortunately she could not fly so slowly  they  so she had  go round  round them   circle  which they moved    halo wendy quite liked it until peter pointed out  drawbacks “she tells me”  said “that  pirates sighted us before  darkness came  got long tom out” “the big gun” “yes and  course they must see her light  if they guess we  near  they  sure  let fly” “wendy” “john” “michael” “tell her  go away  once peter”  three cried simultaneously but  refused “she thinks we have lost  way”  replied stiffly “and she  rather frightened you don’t think i would send her away all  herself when she  frightened” for  moment  circle  light  broken  something gave peter  loving little pinch “then tell her” wendy begged “to put out her light” “she can’t put  out that  about  only thing fairies can’t do it just goes out  itself when she falls asleep same   stars” “then tell her  sleep  once” john almost ordered “she can’t sleep except when she’s sleepy it   only other thing fairies can’t do” “seems  me” growled john “these   only two things worth doing” here  got  pinch but not  loving one “if only one  us had  pocket” peter said “we could carry her  it” however they had set off  such  hurry  there  not  pocket between  four  them he had  happy idea john’s hat tink agreed  travel  hat if   carried   hand john carried it though she had hoped   carried  peter presently wendy took  hat because john said  struck against his knee   flew  this  we shall see led  mischief  tinker bell hated   under  obligation  wendy in  black topper  light  completely hidden  they flew   silence it   stillest silence they had ever known broken once   distant lapping which peter explained   wild beasts drinking   ford  again   rasping sound  might have been  branches  trees rubbing together but  said    redskins sharpening their knives even these noises ceased to michael  loneliness  dreadful “if only something would make  sound”  cried as if  answer  his request  air  rent   most tremendous crash  had ever heard the pirates had fired long tom  them the roar   echoed through  mountains   echoes seemed  cry savagely “where  they where  they where  they” thus sharply did  terrified three learn  difference between  island  makebelieve   same island come true when  last  heavens  steady again john  michael found themselves alone   darkness john  treading  air mechanically  michael without knowing how  float  floating “are you shot” john whispered tremulously “i haven’t tried yet” michael whispered back we know now  no one had been hit peter however had been carried   wind   shot far out  sea while wendy  blown upwards  no companion but tinker bell it would have been well  wendy if   moment she had dropped  hat i don’t know whether  idea came suddenly  tink or whether she had planned    way but she  once popped out   hat  began  lure wendy  her destruction tink  not all bad or

creeping up  behind this shows how real  island was the first  fall out   moving circle   boys they flung themselves down   sward close  their underground home “i do wish peter would come back” every one  them said nervously though  height  still more  breadth they  all larger than their captain “i am  only one who  not afraid   pirates” slightly said   tone  prevented his being  general favourite but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him   added hastily “but i wish  would come back  tell us whether   heard anything more about cinderella” they talked  cinderella  tootles  confident  his mother must have been very like her it  only  peter’s absence  they could speak  mothers  subject being forbidden  him  silly “all i remember about my mother” nibs told them “is  she often said  my father ‘oh how i wish i had  chequebook  my own’ i don’t know what  chequebook is but i should just love  give my mother one” while they talked they heard  distant sound you or i not being wild things   woods would have heard nothing but they heard it     grim song “yo ho yo ho  pirate life the flag o’ skull  bones a merry hour  hempen rope and hey  davy jones” at once  lost boys—but where  they they  no longer there rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly i  tell you where they are with  exception  nibs who  darted away  reconnoitre they  already  their home under  ground  very

will  find  tonight as  pirates advanced  quick eye  starkey sighted nibs disappearing through  wood   once his pistol flashed out but  iron claw gripped his shoulder “captain let go”  cried writhing now   first time we hear  voice  hook it   black voice “put back  pistol first”  said threateningly “it  one  those boys you hate i could have shot him dead” “ay   sound would have brought tiger lily’s redskins upon us do you want  lose your scalp” “shall i after him captain” asked pathetic smee “and tickle him  johnny corkscrew” smee had pleasant names  everything  his cutlass  johnny corkscrew because  wiggled    wound one could mention many lovable traits  smee for instance after killing   his spectacles  wiped instead  his weapon “johnny’s  silent fellow”  reminded hook “not now smee” hook said darkly “he  only one  i want  mischief all  seven scatter  look  them” the pirates disappeared among  trees    moment their captain  smee  alone hook heaved  heavy sigh  i know not why  was perhaps   because   soft beauty   evening but there came over him  desire  confide  his faithful bo’sun  story  his life he spoke long  earnestly but what   all about smee who  rather stupid did not know   least anon  caught  word peter “most  all” hook  saying passionately “i want their captain peter pan ’twas  cut off my arm” he brandished  hook threateningly “i’ve waited long  shake his hand  this oh i’ll tear him” “and yet” said smee “i have often heard you say  hook  worth  score  hands  combing  hair  other homely uses” “ay”  captain answered “if i   mother i would pray  have my children born  this instead  that”   cast  look  pride upon his iron hand  one  scorn upon  other then again  frowned “peter flung my arm”  said wincing “to  crocodile  happened   passing by” “i have often” said smee “noticed your strange dread  crocodiles” “not  crocodiles” hook corrected him “but   one crocodile” he lowered his voice “it liked my arm so much smee    followed me ever since  sea  sea   land  land licking  lips   rest  me” “in  way” said smee “it’s sort   compliment” “i want no such compliments” hook barked petulantly “i want peter pan who first gave  brute  taste  me” he sat down   large mushroom  now there   quiver  his voice “smee”  said huskily “that crocodile would have had me before this but   lucky chance  swallowed  clock which goes tick tick inside it  so before  can reach me i hear  tick  bolt” he laughed but   hollow way “some day” said smee “the clock  run down  then he’ll get you” hook wetted his dry lips “ay”  said “that’s  fear  haunts me” since sitting down  had felt curiously warm “smee”  said “this seat  hot” he jumped up “odds bobs hammer  tongs i’m burning” they examined  mushroom which    size  solidity unknown   mainland they tried  pull  up   came away  once  their hands   had no root stranger still smoke began  once  ascend the pirates looked  each other “a chimney” they both exclaimed they had indeed discovered  chimney   home under  ground it   custom   boys  stop    mushroom when enemies    neighbourhood not only smoke came out  it there came also children’s voices  so safe did  boys feel  their hidingplace  they  gaily chattering the pirates listened grimly  then replaced  mushroom they looked around them  noted  holes   seven trees “did you hear them say peter pan’s  home” smee whispered fidgeting  johnny corkscrew hook nodded he stood   long time lost  thought   last  curdling smile lit up his swarthy face smee had been waiting  it “unrip your plan captain”  cried eagerly “to return   ship” hook replied slowly through his teeth “and cook  large rich cake   jolly thickness  green sugar  it there can  but one room below  there  but one chimney the silly moles had not  sense  see  they did not need  door apiece that shows they have no mother we  leave  cake   shore   mermaids’ lagoon these boys  always swimming about there playing   mermaids they  find  cake  they  gobble  up because having no mother they don’t know how dangerous ’tis  eat rich damp cake” he burst into laughter not hollow laughter now but honest laughter “aha they  die” smee had listened  growing admiration “it’s  wickedest prettiest policy ever i heard of”  cried   their exultation they danced  sang “avast belay when i appear by fear they’re overtook nought’s left upon your bones when you have shaken claws  hook” they began  verse but they never finished it  another sound broke   stilled them there   first such  tiny sound   leaf might have fallen    smothered it but   came nearer   more distinct tick tick tick tick hook stood shuddering one foot   air “the crocodile”  gasped  bounded away followed  his bo’sun it  indeed  crocodile it had passed  redskins who  now   trail   other pirates it oozed  after hook once more  boys emerged into  open but  dangers   night  not yet over  presently nibs rushed breathless into their midst pursued   pack  wolves the tongues   pursuers  hanging out  baying  them  horrible “save me save me” cried nibs falling   ground “but what can we do what can we do” it   high compliment  peter    dire moment their thoughts turned  him “what would peter do” they cried simultaneously almost   same breath they cried “peter would look  them through his legs” and then “let us do what peter would do” it  quite  most successful way  defying wolves   one boy they bent  looked through their legs the next moment   long one but victory came quickly    boys advanced upon them   terrible attitude  wolves dropped their tails  fled now nibs rose   ground   others thought  his staring eyes still saw  wolves but   not wolves  saw “i have seen  wonderfuller thing”  cried  they gathered round him eagerly “a great white bird it  flying this way” “what kind   bird do you think” “i don’t know” nibs said awestruck “but  looks so weary    flies  moans ‘poor wendy’” “poor wendy” “i remember” said slightly instantly “there  birds called wendies” “see  comes” cried curly pointing  wendy   heavens wendy  now almost overhead  they could hear her plaintive cry but more distinct came  shrill voice  tinker bell the jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise  friendship   darting  her victim  every direction pinching savagely each time she touched “hullo tink” cried  wondering boys tink’s reply rang out “peter wants you  shoot  wendy” it  not  their nature  question when peter ordered “let us do what peter wishes” cried  simple boys “quick bows  arrows” all but tootles popped down their trees he had  bow  arrow  him  tink noted it  rubbed her little hands “quick tootles quick” she screamed “peter   so pleased” tootles excitedly fitted  arrow  his bow “out   way tink”  shouted  then  fired  wendy fluttered   ground   arrow  her breast chapter vi the little house foolish tootles  standing like  conqueror over wendy’s body when  other boys sprang armed  their trees “you  too late”  cried proudly “i have shot  wendy peter   so pleased  me” overhead tinker bell shouted “silly ass”  darted into hiding the others did not hear her they had crowded round wendy   they looked  terrible silence fell upon  wood if wendy’s heart had been beating they would all have heard it slightly   first  speak “this  no bird”  said   scared voice “i think this must   lady” “a lady” said tootles  fell atrembling “and we have killed her” nibs said hoarsely they all whipped off their caps “now i see” curly said “peter  bringing her  us” he threw himself sorrowfully   ground “a lady  take care  us  last” said one   twins “and you have killed her” they  sorry  him but sorrier  themselves  when  took  step nearer them they turned  him tootles’ face  very white but there   dignity about him now  had never been there before “i did it”  said reflecting “when ladies used  come  me  dreams i said ‘pretty mother pretty mother’ but when  last she really came i shot her” he moved slowly away “don’t go” they called  pity “i must”  answered shaking “i am so afraid  peter” it   this tragic moment  they heard  sound which made  heart  every one  them rise  his mouth they heard peter crow “peter” they cried    always thus   signalled his return “hide her” they whispered  gathered hastily around wendy but tootles stood aloof again came  ringing crow  peter dropped  front  them “greetings boys”  cried  mechanically they saluted  then again  silence he frowned “i am back”  said hotly “why do you not cheer” they opened their mouths but  cheers would not come he overlooked   his haste  tell  glorious tidings “great news boys”  cried “i have brought  last  mother  you all” still no sound except  little thud  tootles   dropped  his knees “have you not seen her” asked peter becoming troubled “she flew this way” “ah me” one voice said  another said “oh mournful day” tootles rose “peter”  said quietly “i  show her  you”  when  others would still have hidden her  said “back twins let peter see” so they all stood back  let him see  after  had looked   little time  did not know what  do next “she  dead”  said uncomfortably “perhaps she  frightened  being dead” he thought  hopping off   comic sort  way till   out  sight  her  then never going near  spot any more they would all have been glad  follow if  had done this but there   arrow he took   her heart  faced his band “whose arrow”  demanded sternly “mine peter” said tootles  his knees “oh dastard hand” peter said   raised  arrow  use    dagger tootles did not flinch he bared his breast “strike peter”  said firmly “strike true” twice did peter raise  arrow  twice did his hand fall “i cannot strike”  said  awe “there  something stays my hand” all looked  him  wonder save nibs who fortunately looked  wendy “it  she”  cried “the wendy lady see her arm” wonderful  relate wendy had raised her arm nibs bent over her  listened reverently “i think she said ‘poor tootles’”  whispered “she lives” peter said briefly slightly cried instantly “the wendy lady lives” then peter knelt beside her  found his button you remember she had put    chain  she wore round her neck “see”  said “the arrow struck against this it   kiss i gave her it  saved her life” “i remember kisses” slightly interposed quickly “let me see it ay that’s  kiss” peter did not hear him he  begging wendy  get better quickly so   could show her  mermaids of course she could not answer yet being still   frightful faint but  overhead came  wailing note “listen  tink” said curly “she  crying because  wendy lives” then they had  tell peter  tink’s crime  almost never had they seen him look so stern “listen tinker bell”  cried “i am your friend no more begone  me  ever” she flew   his shoulder  pleaded but  brushed her off not until wendy again raised her arm did  relent sufficiently  say “well not  ever but   whole week” do you think tinker bell  grateful  wendy  raising her arm oh dear no never wanted  pinch her so much fairies indeed  strange  peter who understood them best often cuffed them but what  do  wendy  her present delicate state  health “let us carry her down into  house” curly suggested “ay” said slightly “that  what one does  ladies” “no no” peter said “you must not touch her it would not  sufficiently respectful” “that” said slightly “is what i  thinking” “but if she lies there” tootles said “she  die” “ay she  die” slightly admitted “but there  no way out” “yes there is” cried peter “let us build  little house round her” they  all delighted “quick”  ordered them “bring me each  you  best  what we have gut our house be sharp” in  moment they   busy  tailors  night before  wedding they skurried this way  that down  bedding up  firewood  while they   it who should appear but john  michael as they dragged along  ground they fell asleep standing stopped woke up moved another step  slept again “john john” michael would cry “wake up where  nana john  mother” and then john would rub his eyes  mutter “it  true we did fly” you may  sure they  very relieved  find peter “hullo peter” they said “hullo” replied peter amicably though  had quite forgotten them he  very busy   moment measuring wendy  his feet  see how large  house she would need of course  meant  leave room  chairs   table john  michael watched him “is wendy asleep” they asked “yes” “john” michael proposed “let us wake her  get her  make supper  us” but   said  some   other boys rushed  carrying branches   building   house “look  them”  cried “curly” said peter  his most captainy voice “see  these boys help   building   house” “ay ay sir” “build  house” exclaimed john “for  wendy” said curly “for wendy” john said aghast “why she  only  girl” “that” explained curly “is why we  her servants” “you wendy’s servants” “yes” said peter “and you also away  them” the astounded brothers  dragged away  hack  hew  carry “chairs   fender first” peter ordered “then we shall build  house round them” “ay” said slightly “that  how  house  built  all comes back  me” peter thought  everything “slightly”  cried “fetch  doctor” “ay ay” said slightly  once  disappeared scratching his head but  knew peter must  obeyed   returned   moment wearing john’s hat  looking solemn “please sir” said peter going  him “are you  doctor” the difference between him   other boys  such  time   they knew   makebelieve while  him makebelieve  true  exactly  same thing this sometimes troubled them  when they had  makebelieve  they had had their dinners if they broke down  their makebelieve  rapped them   knuckles “yes my little man” slightly anxiously replied who had chapped knuckles “please sir” peter explained “a lady lies very ill” she  lying  their feet but slightly had  sense not  see her “tut tut tut”  said “where does she lie” “in yonder glade” “i  put  glass thing  her mouth” said slightly   madebelieve  do it while peter waited it   anxious moment when  glass thing  withdrawn “how  she” inquired peter “tut tut tut” said slightly “this  cured her” “i am glad” peter cried “i  call again   evening” slightly said “give her beef tea out   cup   spout  it” but after  had returned  hat  john  blew big breaths which  his habit  escaping   difficulty in  meantime  wood had been alive   sound  axes almost everything needed   cosy dwelling already lay  wendy’s feet “if only we knew” said one “the kind  house she likes best” “peter” shouted another “she  moving  her sleep” “her mouth opens” cried  third looking respectfully into it “oh lovely” “perhaps she  going  sing  her sleep” said peter “wendy sing  kind  house you would like  have” immediately without opening her eyes wendy began  sing “i wish i had  pretty house the littlest ever seen with funny little red walls and roof  mossy green” they gurgled  joy  this    greatest good luck  branches they had brought  sticky  red sap  all  ground  carpeted  moss as they rattled up  little house they broke into song themselves “we’ve built  little walls  roof and made  lovely door so tell us mother wendy what  you wanting more” to this she answered greedily “oh really next i think i’ll have gay windows all about with roses peeping in you know and babies peeping out” with  blow  their fists they made windows  large yellow leaves   blinds but roses— “roses” cried peter sternly quickly they madebelieve  grow  loveliest roses up  walls babies to prevent peter ordering babies they hurried into song again “we’ve made  roses peeping out the babes    door we cannot make ourselves you know ’cos we’ve been made before” peter seeing this    good idea  once pretended    his own the house  quite beautiful  no doubt wendy  very cosy within though  course they could no longer see her peter strode up  down ordering finishing touches nothing escaped his eagle eyes just when  seemed absolutely finished “there’s no knocker   door”  said they  very ashamed but tootles gave  sole  his shoe   made  excellent knocker absolutely finished now they thought not  bit  it “there’s no chimney” peter said “we must have  chimney” “it certainly does need  chimney” said john importantly this gave peter  idea he snatched  hat off john’s head knocked out  bottom  put  hat   roof the little house  so pleased  have such  capital chimney that  if  say thank you smoke immediately began  come out   hat now really  truly   finished nothing remained  do but  knock “all look your best” peter warned them “first impressions  awfully important” he  glad no one asked him what first impressions are they  all too busy looking their best he knocked politely  now  wood   still   children not  sound   heard except  tinker bell who  watching   branch  openly sneering what  boys  wondering was would any one answer  knock if  lady what would she  like the door opened   lady came out it  wendy they all whipped off their hats she looked properly surprised  this  just how they had hoped she would look “where am i” she said of course slightly   first  get his word in “wendy lady”  said rapidly “for you we built this house” “oh say you’re pleased” cried nibs “lovely darling house” wendy said  they   very words they had hoped she would say “and we  your children” cried  twins then all went  their knees  holding out their arms cried “o wendy lady  our mother” “ought i” wendy said all shining “of course it’s frightfully fascinating but you see i am only  little girl i have no real experience” “that doesn’t matter” said peter  if    only person present who knew all about it though   really  one who knew least “what we need  just  nice motherly person” “oh dear” wendy said “you see i feel   exactly what i am” “it is  is” they all cried “we saw   once” “very well” she said “i  do my best come inside  once you naughty children i am sure your feet  damp and before i put you  bed i have just time  finish  story  cinderella” in they went i don’t know how there  room  them but you can squeeze very tight   neverland and    first   many joyous evenings they had  wendy by   she tucked them up   great bed   home under  trees but she herself slept  night   little house  peter kept watch outside  drawn sword   pirates could  heard carousing far away   wolves    prowl the little house looked so cosy  safe   darkness   bright light showing through  blinds   chimney smoking beautifully  peter standing  guard after  time  fell asleep  some unsteady fairies had  climb over him  their way home   orgy any   other boys obstructing  fairy path  night they would have mischiefed but they just tweaked peter’s nose  passed on chapter vii the home under the ground one   first things peter did next day   measure wendy  john  michael  hollow trees hook you remember had sneered   boys  thinking they needed  tree apiece but this  ignorance  unless your tree fitted you   difficult  go up  down  no two   boys  quite  same size once you fitted you drew  your breath   top  down you went  exactly  right speed while  ascend you drew   let out alternately  so wriggled up of course when you have mastered  action you  able  do these things without thinking  them  nothing can  more graceful but you simply must fit  peter measures you  your tree  carefully    suit  clothes  only difference being   clothes  made  fit you while you have   made  fit  tree usually   done quite easily   your wearing too many garments or too few but if you  bumpy  awkward places or  only available tree   odd shape peter does some things  you  after  you fit once you fit great care must  taken  go  fitting  this  wendy   discover  her delight keeps  whole family  perfect condition wendy  michael fitted their trees   first try but john had   altered  little after  few days’ practice they could go up  down  gaily  buckets   well and how ardently they grew  love their home under  ground especially wendy it consisted  one large room  all houses should do   floor  which you could dig if you wanted  go fishing   this floor grew stout mushrooms   charming colour which  used  stools a never tree tried hard  grow   centre   room but every morning they sawed  trunk through level   floor by teatime   always about two feet high  then they put  door  top  it  whole thus becoming  table  soon  they cleared away they sawed off  trunk again  thus there  more room  play there   enormous fireplace which   almost any part   room where you cared  light it  across this wendy stretched strings made  fibre  which she suspended her washing the bed  tilted against  wall  day  let down   when  filled nearly half  room  all  boys slept  it except michael lying like sardines   tin there   strict rule against turning round until one gave  signal when all turned  once michael should have used  also but wendy would have  baby     littlest  you know what women are   short  long       hung up   basket it  rough  simple  not unlike what baby bears would have made   underground house   same circumstances but there  one recess   wall no larger than  birdcage which   private apartment  tinker bell it could  shut off   rest   house

herself tink  very contemptuous   rest   house  indeed  perhaps inevitable  her chamber though beautiful looked rather conceited having  appearance   nose permanently turned up i suppose   all especially entrancing  wendy because those rampagious boys  hers gave her so much  do really there  whole weeks when except perhaps   stocking   evening she  never above ground the cooking i can tell you kept her nose   pot  even if there  nothing  it even if there  no pot she had  keep watching   came aboil just  same you never exactly knew whether there would   real meal or just  makebelieve  all depended upon peter’s whim  could eat really eat if   part   game but  could not stodge just  feel stodgy which  what most children like better than anything else  next best thing being  talk about it makebelieve  so real  him  during  meal   you could see him getting rounder of course   trying but you simply had  follow his lead  if you could prove  him  you  getting loose  your tree  let you stodge wendy’s favourite time  sewing  darning  after they had all gone  bed then  she expressed it she had  breathing time  herself  she occupied   making new things  them  putting double pieces   knees  they  all most frightfully hard  their knees when she sat down   basketful  their stockings every heel   hole  it she would fling up her arms  exclaim “oh dear i am sure i sometimes think spinsters    envied” her face beamed when she exclaimed this you remember about her pet wolf well  very soon discovered  she had come   island   found her out  they just ran into each other’s arms after   followed her about everywhere as time wore  did she think much about  beloved parents she had left behind her this   difficult question because   quite impossible  say how time does wear    neverland where   calculated  moons  suns  there  ever so many more  them than   mainland but i am afraid  wendy did not really worry about her father  mother she  absolutely confident  they would always keep  window open  her  fly back by  this gave her complete ease  mind what did disturb her  times   john remembered his parents vaguely only  people  had once known while michael  quite willing  believe  she  really his mother these things scared her  little  nobly anxious  do her duty she tried  fix  old life  their minds  setting them examination papers  it  like  possible   ones she used  do  school the other boys thought this awfully interesting  insisted  joining  they made slates  themselves  sat round  table writing  thinking hard about  questions she had written  another slate  passed round they   most ordinary questions—“what   colour  mother’s eyes which  taller father or mother was mother blonde or brunette answer all three questions if possible” “a write  essay  not less than  words  how i spent my last holidays or the characters  father  mother compared only one  these   attempted” or “ describe mother’s laugh  describe father’s laugh  describe mother’s party dress  describe  kennel   inmate” they  just everyday questions like these  when you could not answer them you  told  make  cross    really dreadful what  number  crosses even john made of course  only boy who replied  every question  slightly  no one could have been more hopeful  coming out first but his answers  perfectly ridiculous   really came out last  melancholy thing peter did not compete for one thing  despised all mothers except wendy   another    only boy   island who could neither write nor spell not  smallest word he  above all  sort  thing by  way  questions  all written   past tense what   colour  mother’s eyes  so on wendy you see had been forgetting too adventures  course  we shall see   daily occurrence but about this time peter invented  wendy’s help  new game  fascinated him enormously until  suddenly had no more interest  it which  you have been told  what always happened  his games it consisted  pretending not  have adventures  doing  sort  thing john  michael had been doing all their lives sitting  stools flinging balls   air pushing each other going out  walks  coming back without having killed so much   grizzly to see peter doing nothing   stool   great sight  could not help looking solemn  such times  sit still seemed  him such  comic thing  do he boasted   had gone walking   good  his health for several suns these   most novel  all adventures  him  john  michael had  pretend   delighted also otherwise  would have treated them severely he often went out alone  when  came back you  never absolutely certain whether  had had  adventure or not he might have forgotten  so completely   said nothing about it  then when you went out you found  body and   other hand  might say  great deal about it  yet you could not find  body sometimes  came home  his head bandaged  then wendy cooed over him  bathed   lukewarm water while  told  dazzling tale but she  never quite sure you know there were however many adventures which she knew   true because she   them herself  there  still more    least partly true   other boys   them  said they  wholly true to describe them all would require  book  large   englishlatin latinenglish dictionary   most we can do   give one   specimen   average hour   island the difficulty  which one  choose should we take  brush   redskins  slightly gulch it   sanguinary affair  especially interesting  showing one  peter’s peculiarities which     middle   fight  would suddenly change sides at  gulch when victory  still   balance sometimes leaning this way  sometimes that  called out “i’m redskin today what  you tootles” and tootles answered “redskin what  you nibs”  nibs said “redskin what  you twin”  so on  they  all redskins   course this would have ended  fight had not  real redskins fascinated  peter’s methods agreed   lost boys   once  so   they all went again more fiercely than ever the extraordinary upshot  this adventure was—but we have not decided yet  this   adventure we   narrate perhaps  better one would   night attack   redskins   house under  ground when several  them stuck   hollow trees  had   pulled out like corks or we might tell how peter saved tiger lily’s life   mermaids’ lagoon  so made her his ally or we could tell   cake  pirates cooked so   boys might eat   perish  how they placed   one cunning spot after another but always wendy snatched    hands  her children so   time  lost  succulence  became  hard   stone   used   missile  hook fell over    dark or suppose we tell   birds   peter’s friends particularly   never bird  built   tree overhanging  lagoon  how  nest fell into  water  still  bird sat  her eggs  peter gave orders  she  not   disturbed that   pretty story   end shows how grateful  bird can be but if we tell  we must also tell  whole adventure   lagoon which would  course  telling two adventures rather than just one a shorter adventure  quite  exciting  tinker bell’s attempt   help  some street fairies  have  sleeping wendy conveyed   great floating leaf   mainland fortunately  leaf gave way  wendy woke thinking   bathtime  swam back or again we might choose peter’s defiance   lions when  drew  circle round him   ground   arrow  dared them  cross it  though  waited  hours   other boys  wendy looking  breathlessly  trees not one  them dared  accept his challenge which  these adventures shall we choose the best way    toss  it i have tossed   lagoon  won this almost makes one wish   gulch or  cake or tink’s leaf had won of course i could do  again  make  best out  three however perhaps fairest  stick   lagoon chapter viii the mermaids’ lagoon if you shut your eyes    lucky one you may see  times  shapeless pool  lovely pale colours suspended   darkness then if you squeeze your eyes tighter  pool begins  take shape   colours become so vivid   another squeeze they must go  fire but just before they go  fire you see  lagoon this   nearest you ever get     mainland just one heavenly moment if there could  two moments you might see  surf  hear  mermaids singing the children often spent long summer days  this lagoon swimming or floating most   time playing  mermaid games   water  so forth you must not think  this   mermaids   friendly terms  them   contrary   among wendy’s lasting regrets  all  time she    island she never had  civil word  one  them when she stole softly   edge   lagoon she might see them   score especially  marooners’ rock where they loved  bask combing out their hair   lazy way  quite irritated her or she might even swim  tiptoe   were  within  yard  them but then they saw her  dived probably splashing her  their tails not  accident but intentionally they treated all  boys   same way except  course peter who chatted  them  marooners’ rock   hour  sat  their tails when they got cheeky he gave wendy one  their combs the most haunting time  which  see them    turn   moon when they utter strange wailing cries but  lagoon  dangerous  mortals then  until  evening  which we have now  tell wendy had never seen  lagoon  moonlight less  fear   course peter would have accompanied her than because she had strict rules about every one being  bed  seven she  often   lagoon however  sunny days after rain when  mermaids come up  extraordinary numbers  play  their bubbles the bubbles  many colours made  rainbow water they treat  balls hitting them gaily  one  another  their tails  trying  keep them   rainbow till they burst the goals   each end   rainbow   keepers only  allowed  use their hands sometimes  dozen  these games   going    lagoon   time    quite  pretty sight but  moment  children tried  join  they had  play  themselves   mermaids immediately disappeared nevertheless we have proof  they secretly watched  interlopers   not above taking  idea  them  john introduced  new way  hitting  bubble   head instead   hand   mermaids adopted it this   one mark  john  left   neverland it must also have been rather pretty  see  children resting   rock  half  hour after their midday meal wendy insisted  their doing this   had    real rest even though  meal  makebelieve so they lay there   sun  their bodies glistened  it while she sat beside them  looked important it  one such day  they  all  marooners’ rock the rock  not much larger than their great bed but  course they all knew how not  take up much room  they  dozing or  least lying  their eyes shut  pinching occasionally when they thought wendy  not looking she  very busy stitching while she stitched  change came   lagoon little shivers ran over it   sun went away  shadows stole across  water turning  cold wendy could no longer see  thread her needle  when she looked up  lagoon  had always hitherto been such  laughing place seemed formidable  unfriendly it  not she knew  night had come but something  dark  night had come no worse than that it had not come but  had sent  shiver through  sea  say    coming what  it there crowded upon her all  stories she had been told  marooners’ rock so called because evil captains put sailors    leave them there  drown they drown when  tide rises  then   submerged of course she should have roused  children  once not merely because   unknown   stalking toward them but because   no longer good  them  sleep   rock grown chilly but she   young mother  she did not know this she thought you simply must stick  your rule about half  hour after  midday meal so though fear  upon her  she longed  hear male voices she would not waken them even when she heard  sound  muffled oars though her heart   her mouth she did not waken them she stood over them  let them have their sleep out was  not brave  wendy it  well  those boys then  there  one among them who could sniff danger even  his sleep peter sprang erect  wide awake  once   dog   one warning cry  roused  others he stood motionless one hand  his ear “pirates”  cried the others came closer  him a strange smile  playing about his face  wendy saw   shuddered while  smile   his face no one dared address him all they could do   stand ready  obey the order came sharp  incisive “dive” there   gleam  legs  instantly  lagoon seemed deserted marooners’ rock stood alone   forbidding waters  if   itself marooned the boat drew nearer it   pirate dinghy  three figures  her smee  starkey   third  captive no other than tiger lily her hands  ankles  tied  she knew what    her fate she    left   rock  perish  end  one  her race more terrible than death  fire or torture    not written   book   tribe  there  no path through water   happy huntingground yet her face  impassive she   daughter   chief she must die   chief’s daughter   enough they had caught her boarding  pirate ship   knife  her mouth no watch  kept   ship  being hook’s boast   wind  his name guarded  ship   mile around now her fate would help  guard  also one more wail would go  round   wind  night in  gloom  they brought  them  two pirates did not see  rock till they crashed into it “luff you lubber” cried  irish voice   smee’s “here’s  rock now then what we have  do   hoist  redskin     leave her here  drown” it   work  one brutal moment  land  beautiful girl   rock she  too proud  offer  vain resistance quite near  rock but out  sight two heads  bobbing up  down peter’s  wendy’s wendy  crying     first tragedy she had seen peter had seen many tragedies but  had forgotten them all he  less sorry than wendy  tiger lily   two against one  angered him   meant  save her an easy way would have been  wait until  pirates had gone but   never one  choose  easy way there  almost nothing  could not do   now imitated  voice  hook “ahoy there you lubbers”  called it   marvellous imitation “the captain” said  pirates staring  each other  surprise “he must  swimming out  us” starkey said when they had looked  him  vain “we  putting  redskin   rock” smee called out “set her free” came  astonishing answer “free” “yes cut her bonds  let her go” “but captain—” “at once d’ye hear” cried peter “or i’ll plunge my hook  you” “this  queer” smee gasped “better do what  captain orders” said starkey nervously “ay ay” smee said   cut tiger lily’s cords at once like  eel she slid between starkey’s legs into  water of course wendy  very elated over peter’s cleverness but she knew   would  elated also  very likely crow  thus betray himself so  once her hand went out  cover his mouth but   stayed even   act  “boat ahoy” rang over  lagoon  hook’s voice  this time   not peter who had spoken peter may have been about  crow but his face puckered   whistle  surprise instead “boat ahoy” again came  voice now wendy understood the real hook  also   water he  swimming   boat   his men showed  light  guide him  had soon reached them in  light   lantern wendy saw his hook grip  boat’s side she saw his evil swarthy face   rose dripping   water and quaking she would have liked  swim away but peter would not budge he  tingling  life  also topheavy  conceit “am i not  wonder oh i am  wonder”  whispered  her  though she thought so also she  really glad   sake  his reputation  no one heard him except herself he signed  her  listen the two pirates  very curious  know what had brought their captain  them but  sat  his head  his hook   position  profound melancholy “captain  all well” they asked timidly but  answered   hollow moan “he sighs” said smee “he sighs again” said starkey “and yet  third time  sighs” said smee then  last  spoke passionately “the game’s up”  cried “those boys have found  mother” affrighted though she was wendy swelled  pride “o evil day” cried starkey “what’s  mother” asked  ignorant smee wendy  so shocked  she exclaimed “he doesn’t know”  always after this she felt  if you could have  pet pirate smee would  her one peter pulled her beneath  water  hook had started up crying “what  that” “i heard nothing” said starkey raising  lantern over  waters    pirates looked they saw  strange sight it   nest i have told you of floating   lagoon   never bird  sitting  it “see” said hook  answer  smee’s question “that   mother what  lesson the nest must have fallen into  water but would  mother desert her eggs no” there   break  his voice  if   moment  recalled innocent days when—but  brushed away this weakness  his hook smee much impressed gazed   bird   nest  borne past but  more suspicious starkey said “if she   mother perhaps she  hanging about here  help peter” hook winced “ay”  said “that   fear  haunts me” he  roused  this dejection  smee’s eager voice “captain” said smee “could we not kidnap these boys’ mother  make her our mother” “it   princely scheme” cried hook   once  took practical shape  his great brain “we  seize  children  carry them   boat  boys we  make walk  plank  wendy shall  our mother” again wendy forgot herself “never” she cried  bobbed “what  that” but they could see nothing they thought  must have been  leaf   wind “do you agree my bullies” asked hook “there  my hand  it” they both said “and there  my hook swear” they all swore by this time they    rock  suddenly hook remembered tiger lily “where   redskin”  demanded abruptly he had  playful humour  moments  they thought this  one   moments “that  all right captain” smee answered complacently “we let her go” “let her go” cried hook “’twas your own orders”  bo’sun faltered “you called over  water  us  let her go” said starkey “brimstone  gall” thundered hook “what cozening  going  here” his face had gone black  rage but  saw  they believed their words    startled “lads”  said shaking  little “i gave no such order” “it  passing queer” smee said  they all fidgeted uncomfortably hook raised his voice but there   quiver  it “spirit  haunts this dark lagoon tonight”  cried “dost hear me” of course peter should have kept quiet but  course  did not he immediately answered  hook’s voice “odds bobs hammer  tongs i hear you” in  supreme moment hook did not blanch even   gills but smee  starkey clung  each other  terror “who  you stranger speak” hook demanded “i am james hook” replied  voice “captain   jolly roger” “you  not you  not” hook cried hoarsely “brimstone  gall”  voice retorted “say  again  i’ll cast anchor  you” hook tried  more ingratiating manner “if you  hook”  said almost humbly “come tell me who am i” “a codfish” replied  voice “only  codfish” “a codfish” hook echoed blankly    then but not till then  his proud spirit broke he saw his men draw back  him “have we been captained all this time   codfish” they muttered “it  lowering  our pride” they  his dogs snapping  him but tragic figure though  had become  scarcely heeded them against such fearful evidence   not their belief  him   needed   his own he felt his ego slipping  him “don’t desert me bully”  whispered hoarsely  it in his dark nature there   touch   feminine   all  great pirates   sometimes gave him intuitions suddenly  tried  guessing game “hook”  called “have you another voice” now peter could never resist  game   answered blithely  his own voice “i have” “and another name” “ay ay” “vegetable” asked hook “no” “mineral” “no” “animal” “yes” “man” “no” this answer rang out scornfully “boy” “yes” “ordinary boy” “no” “wonderful boy” to wendy’s pain  answer  rang out this time  “yes” “are you  england” “no” “are you here” “yes” hook  completely puzzled “you ask him some questions”  said   others wiping his damp brow smee reflected “i can’t think   thing”  said regretfully “can’t guess can’t guess” crowed peter “do you give  up” of course  his pride   carrying  game too far   miscreants saw their chance “yes yes” they answered eagerly “well then”  cried “i am peter pan” pan in  moment hook  himself again  smee  starkey  his faithful henchmen “now we have him” hook shouted “into  water smee starkey mind  boat take him dead or alive” he leaped   spoke  simultaneously came  gay voice  peter “are you ready boys” “ay ay”  various parts   lagoon “then lam into  pirates” the fight  short  sharp first  draw blood  john who gallantly climbed into  boat  held starkey there  fierce struggle  which  cutlass  torn   pirate’s grasp he wriggled overboard  john leapt after him the dinghy drifted away here  there  head bobbed up   water  there   flash  steel followed   cry or  whoop in  confusion some struck  their own side the corkscrew  smee got tootles   fourth rib but   himself pinked  turn  curly farther   rock starkey  pressing slightly   twins hard where all this time  peter he  seeking bigger game the others  all brave boys  they must not  blamed  backing   pirate captain his iron claw made  circle  dead water round him  which they fled like affrighted fishes but there  one who did not fear him there  one prepared  enter  circle strangely   not   water  they met hook rose   rock  breathe    same moment peter scaled    opposite side the rock  slippery   ball  they had  crawl rather than climb neither knew   other  coming each feeling   grip met  other’s arm  surprise they raised their heads their faces  almost touching so they met some   greatest heroes have confessed  just before they fell  they had  sinking had  been so  peter   moment i would admit it after all    only man   seacook had feared but peter had no sinking  had one feeling only gladness   gnashed his pretty teeth  joy quick  thought  snatched  knife  hook’s belt   about  drive  home when  saw    higher up  rock than his foe it would not have been fighting fair he gave  pirate  hand  help him up it  then  hook bit him not  pain  this but  unfairness  what dazed peter it made him quite helpless he could only stare horrified every child  affected thus  first time   treated unfairly all  thinks    right  when  comes  you   yours  fairness after you have been unfair  him   love you again but  never afterwards  quite  same boy no one ever gets over  first unfairness no one except peter he often met it but  always forgot it i suppose    real difference between him  all  rest so when  met  now   like  first time   could just stare helpless twice  iron hand clawed him a few moments afterwards  other boys saw hook   water striking wildly   ship no elation   pestilent face now only white fear   crocodile   dogged pursuit  him on ordinary occasions  boys would have swum alongside cheering but now they  uneasy  they had lost both peter  wendy   scouring  lagoon  them calling them  name they found  dinghy  went home  it shouting “peter wendy”  they went but no answer came save mocking laughter   mermaids “they must  swimming back or flying”  boys concluded they  not very anxious because they had such faith  peter they chuckled boylike because they would  late  bed    all mother wendy’s fault when their voices died away there came cold silence over  lagoon  then  feeble cry “help help” two small figures  beating against  rock  girl had fainted  lay   boy’s arm with  last effort peter pulled her up  rock  then lay down beside her even   also fainted  saw   water  rising he knew  they would soon  drowned but  could do no more as they lay side  side  mermaid caught wendy   feet  began pulling her softly into  water peter feeling her slip  him woke   start   just  time  draw her back but  had  tell her  truth “we    rock wendy”  said “but   growing smaller soon  water   over it” she did not understand even now “we must go” she said almost brightly “yes”  answered faintly “shall we swim or fly peter” he had  tell her “do you think you could swim or fly  far   island wendy without my help” she had  admit  she  too tired he moaned “what  it” she asked anxious about him  once “i can’t help you wendy hook wounded me i can neither fly nor swim” “do you mean we shall both  drowned” “look how  water  rising” they put their hands over their eyes  shut out  sight they thought they would soon  no more as they sat thus something brushed against peter  light   kiss  stayed there  if saying timidly “can i   any use” it   tail   kite which michael had made some days before it had torn itself out  his hand  floated away “michael’s kite” peter said without interest but next moment  had seized  tail   pulling  kite toward him “it lifted michael off  ground”  cried “why should  not carry you” “both  us” “it can’t lift two michael  curly tried” “let us draw lots” wendy said bravely “and you  lady never” already  had tied  tail round her she clung  him she refused  go without him but   “goodbye wendy”  pushed her   rock    few minutes she  borne out  his sight peter  alone   lagoon the rock  very small now soon  would  submerged pale rays  light tiptoed across  waters     there    heard  sound  once  most musical   most melancholy   world  mermaids calling   moon peter  not quite like other boys but   afraid  last a tremour ran through him like  shudder passing over  sea but   sea one shudder follows another till there  hundreds  them  peter felt just  one next moment   standing erect   rock again   smile  his face   drum beating within him it  saying “to die    awfully big adventure” chapter ix the never bird the last sound peter heard before   quite alone   mermaids retiring one  one  their bedchambers under  sea he  too far away  hear their doors shut but every door   coral caves where they live rings  tiny bell when  opens or closes as  all  nicest houses   mainland   heard  bells steadily  waters rose till they  nibbling  his feet   pass  time until they made their final gulp  watched  only thing   lagoon he thought    piece  floating paper perhaps part   kite  wondered idly how long  would take  drift ashore presently  noticed   odd thing    undoubtedly out upon  lagoon  some definite purpose    fighting  tide  sometimes winning  when  won peter always sympathetic   weaker side could not help clapping   such  gallant piece  paper it  not really  piece  paper    never bird making desperate efforts  reach peter   nest by working her wings   way she had learned since  nest fell into  water she  able  some extent  guide her strange craft but   time peter recognised her she  very exhausted she had come  save him  give him her nest though there  eggs  it i rather wonder   bird  though  had been nice  her  had also sometimes tormented her i can suppose only that like mrs darling   rest  them she  melted because  had all his first teeth she called out  him what she had come for   called out  her what she  doing there but  course neither  them understood  other’s language in fanciful stories people can talk   birds freely  i wish   moment i could pretend  this  such  story  say  peter replied intelligently   never bird but truth  best  i want  tell you only what really happened well not only could they not understand each other but they forgot their manners “i—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest”  bird called speaking  slowly  distinctly  possible “and—then—you—can—drift—ashore but—i—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—try to—swim—to—it” “what  you quacking about” peter answered “why don’t you let  nest drift  usual” “i—want—you—”  bird said  repeated  all over then peter tried slow  distinct “what—are—you—quacking—about”  so on the never bird became irritated they have very short tempers “you dunderheaded little jay” she screamed “why don’t you do  i tell you” peter felt  she  calling him names    venture  retorted hotly “so  you” then rather curiously they both snapped out  same remark “shut up” “shut up” nevertheless  bird  determined  save him if she could   one last mighty effort she propelled  nest against  rock then up she flew deserting her eggs so   make her meaning clear then  last  understood  clutched  nest  waved his thanks   bird  she fluttered overhead it  not  receive his thanks however  she hung there   sky   not even  watch him get into  nest    see what  did  her eggs there  two large white eggs  peter lifted them up  reflected the bird covered her face  her wings so  not  see  last  them but she could not help peeping between  feathers i forget whether i have told you  there   stave   rock driven into   some buccaneers  long ago  mark  site  buried treasure the children had discovered  glittering hoard  when   mischievous mood used  fling showers  moidores diamonds pearls  pieces  eight   gulls who pounced upon them  food  then flew away raging   scurvy trick  had been played upon them the stave  still there    starkey had hung his hat  deep tarpaulin watertight   broad brim peter put  eggs into this hat  set    lagoon it floated beautifully the never bird saw  once what   up to  screamed her admiration  him and alas peter crowed his agreement  her then  got into  nest reared  stave     mast  hung up his shirt   sail at  same moment  bird fluttered down upon  hat  once more sat snugly  her eggs she drifted  one direction    borne off  another both cheering of course when peter landed  beached his barque   place where  bird would easily find it but  hat  such  great success  she abandoned  nest it drifted about till  went  pieces  often starkey came   shore   lagoon   many bitter feelings watched  bird sitting  his hat as we shall not see her again  may  worth mentioning here  all never birds now build   shape  nest   broad brim  which  youngsters take  airing great   rejoicings when peter reached  home under  ground almost  soon  wendy who had been carried hither  thither   kite every boy had adventures  tell but perhaps  biggest adventure  all   they  several hours late  bed this so inflated them  they did various dodgy things  get staying up still longer such  demanding bandages but wendy though glorying  having them all home again safe  sound  scandalised   lateness   hour  cried “to bed  bed”   voice  had   obeyed next day however she  awfully tender  gave out bandages  every one  they played till bedtime  limping about  carrying their arms  slings chapter x the happy home one important result   brush   lagoon    made  redskins their friends peter had saved tiger lily   dreadful fate  now there  nothing she  her braves would not do  him all night they sat above keeping watch over  home under  ground  awaiting  big attack   pirates which obviously could not  much longer delayed even  day they hung about smoking  pipe  peace  looking almost  if they wanted titbits  eat they called peter  great white father prostrating themselves before him   liked this tremendously so    not really good  him “the great white father”  would say  them   very lordly manner  they grovelled  his feet “is glad  see  piccaninny warriors protecting his wigwam   pirates” “me tiger lily”  lovely creature would reply “peter pan save me me his velly nice friend me no let pirates hurt him” she  far too pretty  cringe  this way but peter thought  his due   would answer condescendingly “it  good peter pan  spoken” always when  said “peter pan  spoken”  meant  they must now shut up  they accepted  humbly   spirit but they   no means so respectful   other boys whom they looked upon  just ordinary braves they said “howdo”  them  things like that  what annoyed  boys   peter seemed  think this all right secretly wendy sympathised  them  little but she  far too loyal  housewife  listen  any complaints against father “father knows best” she always said whatever her private opinion must be her private opinion    redskins should not call her  squaw we have now reached  evening     known among them   night  nights because   adventures  their upshot the day  if quietly gathering  forces had been almost uneventful  now  redskins  their blankets   their posts above while below  children  having their evening meal all except peter who had gone out  get  time the way you got  time   island   find  crocodile  then stay near him till  clock struck the meal happened    makebelieve tea  they sat around  board guzzling  their greed  really what  their chatter  recriminations  noise  wendy said  positively deafening to  sure she did not mind noise but she simply would not have them grabbing things  then excusing themselves  saying  tootles had pushed their elbow there   fixed rule  they must never hit back  meals but should refer  matter  dispute  wendy  raising  right arm politely  saying “i complain  soandso” but what usually happened   they forgot  do this or did  too much “silence” cried wendy when   twentieth time she had told them  they  not all  speak  once “is your mug empty slightly darling” “not quite empty mummy” slightly said after looking into  imaginary mug “he hasn’t even begun  drink his milk” nibs interposed this  telling  slightly seized his chance “i complain  nibs”  cried promptly john however had held up his hand first “well john” “may i sit  peter’s chair    not here” “sit  father’s chair john” wendy  scandalised “certainly not” “he  not really our father” john answered “he didn’t even know how  father does till i showed him” this  grumbling “we complain  john” cried  twins tootles held up his hand he  so much  humblest  them indeed    only humble one  wendy  specially gentle  him “i don’t suppose” tootles said diffidently “that i could  father” “no tootles” once tootles began which  not very often  had  silly way  going on “as i can’t  father”  said heavily “i don’t suppose michael you would let me  baby” “no i won’t” michael rapped out he  already  his basket “as i can’t  baby” tootles said getting heavier  heavier  heavier “do you think i could   twin” “no indeed” replied  twins “it’s awfully difficult    twin” “as i can’t  anything important” said tootles “would any  you like  see me do  trick” “no” they all replied then  last  stopped “i hadn’t really any hope”  said the hateful telling broke out again “slightly  coughing   table” “the twins began  cheesecakes” “curly  taking both butter  honey” “nibs  speaking  his mouth full” “i complain   twins” “i complain  curly” “i complain  nibs” “oh dear oh dear” cried wendy “i’m sure i sometimes think  spinsters    envied” she told them  clear away  sat down  her workbasket  heavy load  stockings  every knee   hole    usual “wendy” remonstrated michael “i’m too big   cradle” “i must have somebody   cradle” she said almost tartly “and you   littlest a cradle  such  nice homely thing  have about  house” while she sewed they played around her such  group  happy faces  dancing limbs lit up   romantic fire it had become  very familiar scene this   home under  ground but we  looking     last time there   step above  wendy you may  sure   first  recognize it “children i hear your father’s step he likes you  meet him   door” above  redskins crouched before peter “watch well braves i have spoken” and then  so often before  gay children dragged him  his tree as so often before but never again he had brought nuts   boys  well   correct time  wendy “peter you just spoil them you know” wendy simpered “ah old lady” said peter hanging up his gun “it  me told him mothers  called old lady” michael whispered  curly “i complain  michael” said curly instantly the first twin came  peter “father we want  dance” “dance away my little man” said peter who   high good humour “but we want you  dance” peter  really  best dancer among them but  pretended   scandalised “me my old bones would rattle” “and mummy too” “what” cried wendy “the mother  such  armful dance” “but   saturday night” slightly insinuated it  not really saturday night  least  may have been  they had long lost count   days but always if they wanted  do anything special they said this  saturday night  then they did it “of course   saturday night peter” wendy said relenting “people  our figure wendy” “but   only among our own progeny” “true true” so they  told they could dance but they must put  their nighties first “ah old lady” peter said aside  wendy warming himself   fire  looking down  her  she sat turning  heel “there  nothing more pleasant   evening  you  me when  day’s toil  over than  rest   fire   little ones near by” “it  sweet peter isn’t it” wendy said frightfully gratified “peter i think curly  your nose” “michael takes after you” she went  him  put her hand  his shoulder “dear peter” she said “with such  large family  course i have now passed my best but you don’t want  change me do you” “no wendy” certainly  did not want  change but  looked  her uncomfortably blinking you know like one not sure whether   awake or asleep “peter what  it” “i  just thinking”  said  little scared “it  only makebelieve isn’t it  i am their father” “oh yes” wendy said primly “you see”  continued apologetically “it would make me seem so old   their real father” “but they  ours peter yours  mine” “but not really wendy”  asked anxiously “not if you don’t wish it” she replied  she distinctly heard his sigh  relief “peter” she asked trying  speak firmly “what  your exact feelings  me” “those   devoted son wendy” “i thought so” she said  went  sat  herself   extreme end   room “you  so queer”  said frankly puzzled “and tiger lily  just  same there  something she wants    me but she says   not my mother” “no indeed   not” wendy replied  frightful emphasis now we know why she  prejudiced against  redskins “then what  it” “it isn’t   lady  tell” “oh very well” peter said  little nettled “perhaps tinker bell  tell me” “oh yes tinker bell  tell you” wendy retorted scornfully “she   abandoned little creature” here tink who   her bedroom eavesdropping squeaked out something impudent “she says she glories  being abandoned” peter interpreted he had  sudden idea “perhaps tink wants   my mother” “you silly ass” cried tinker bell   passion she had said  so often  wendy needed no translation “i almost agree  her” wendy snapped fancy wendy snapping but she had been much tried  she little knew what   happen before  night  out if she had known she would not have snapped none  them knew perhaps   best not  know their ignorance gave them one more glad hour       their last hour   island let us rejoice  there  sixty glad minutes  it they sang  danced  their nightgowns such  deliciously creepy song  was  which they pretended   frightened  their own shadows little witting  so soon shadows would close  upon them  whom they would shrink  real fear so uproariously gay   dance  how they buffeted each other   bed  out  it it   pillow fight rather than  dance  when   finished  pillows insisted  one bout more like partners who know  they may never meet again the stories they told before   time  wendy’s goodnight story even slightly tried  tell  story  night but  beginning  so fearfully dull   appalled not only  others but himself   said gloomily “yes    dull beginning i say let us pretend     end” and then  last they all got into bed  wendy’s story  story they loved best  story peter hated usually when she began  tell this story  left  room or put his hands over his ears  possibly if  had done either  those things this time they might all still    island but tonight  remained  his stool  we shall see what happened chapter xi wendy’s story “listen then” said wendy settling down  her story  michael  her feet  seven boys   bed “there  once  gentleman—” “i had rather  had been  lady” curly said “i wish  had been  white rat” said nibs “quiet” their mother admonished them “there   lady also and—” “oh mummy” cried  first twin “you mean  there   lady also don’t you she  not dead  she” “oh no” “i am awfully glad she isn’t dead” said tootles “are you glad john” “of course i am” “are you glad nibs” “rather” “are you glad twins” “we  glad” “oh dear” sighed wendy “little less noise there” peter called out determined  she should have fair play however beastly  story  might   his opinion “the gentleman’s name” wendy continued “was mr darling  her name  mrs darling” “i knew them” john said  annoy  others “i think i knew them” said michael rather doubtfully “they  married you know” explained wendy “and what do you think they had” “white rats” cried nibs inspired “no” “it’s awfully puzzling” said tootles who knew  story  heart “quiet tootles they had three descendants” “what  descendants” “well you  one twin” “did you hear that john i am  descendant” “descendants  only children” said john “oh dear oh dear” sighed wendy “now these three children had  faithful nurse called nana but mr darling  angry  her  chained her up   yard  so all  children flew away” “it’s  awfully good story” said nibs “they flew away” wendy continued “to  neverland where  lost children are” “i just thought they did” curly broke  excitedly “i don’t know how  is but i just thought they did” “o wendy” cried tootles “was one   lost children called tootles” “yes  was” “i am   story hurrah i am   story nibs” “hush now i want you  consider  feelings   unhappy parents  all their children flown away” “oo” they all moaned though they  not really considering  feelings   unhappy parents one jot “think   empty beds” “oo” “it’s awfully sad”  first twin said cheerfully “i don’t see how  can have  happy ending” said  second twin “do you nibs” “i’m frightfully anxious” “if you knew how great   mother’s love” wendy told them triumphantly “you would have no fear” she had now come   part  peter hated “i do like  mother’s love” said tootles hitting nibs   pillow “do you like  mother’s love nibs” “i do just” said nibs hitting back “you see” wendy said complacently “our heroine knew   mother would always leave  window open  her children  fly back by so they stayed away  years  had  lovely time” “did they ever go back” “let us now” said wendy bracing herself up  her finest effort “take  peep into  future”  they all gave themselves  twist  makes peeps into  future easier “years have rolled by  who  this elegant lady  uncertain age alighting  london station” “o wendy who  she” cried nibs every bit  excited  if  didn’t know “can  be—yes—no—it is—the fair wendy” “oh” “and who   two noble portly figures accompanying her now grown  man’s estate can they  john  michael they are” “oh” “‘see dear brothers’ says wendy pointing upwards ‘there   window still standing open ah now we  rewarded  our sublime faith   mother’s love’ so up they flew  their mummy  daddy  pen cannot describe  happy scene over which we draw  veil” that   story  they   pleased     fair narrator herself everything just   should be you see off we skip like  most heartless things   world which  what children are but so attractive  we have  entirely selfish time  then when we have need  special attention we nobly return  it confident  we shall  rewarded instead  smacked so great indeed  their faith   mother’s love  they felt they could afford   callous   bit longer but there  one there who knew better  when wendy finished  uttered  hollow groan “what  it peter” she cried running  him thinking   ill she felt him solicitously lower down than his chest “where  it peter” “it isn’t  kind  pain” peter replied darkly “then what kind  it” “wendy you  wrong about mothers” they all gathered round him  affright so alarming  his agitation    fine candour  told them what  had hitherto concealed “long ago”  said “i thought like you  my mother would always keep  window open  me so i stayed away  moons  moons  moons  then flew back but  window  barred  mother had forgotten all about me  there  another little boy sleeping  my bed” i am not sure  this  true but peter thought   true   scared them “are you sure mothers  like that” “yes” so this   truth about mothers the toads still   best   careful  no one knows so quickly   child when  should give in “wendy let us go home” cried john  michael together “yes” she said clutching them “not tonight” asked  lost boys bewildered they knew  what they called their hearts  one can get  quite well without  mother     only  mothers who think you can’t “at once” wendy replied resolutely   horrible thought had come  her “perhaps mother   half mourning  this time” this dread made her forgetful  what must  peter’s feelings  she said  him rather sharply “peter  you make  necessary arrangements” “if you wish it”  replied  coolly  if she had asked him  pass  nuts not so much   sorrytoloseyou between them if she did not mind  parting   going  show her  peter  neither did he but  course  cared very much    so full  wrath against grownups who  usual  spoiling everything   soon   got inside his tree  breathed intentionally quick short breaths   rate  about five   second he did this because there   saying   neverland that every time you breathe  grownup dies  peter  killing them off vindictively  fast  possible then having given  necessary instructions   redskins  returned   home where  unworthy scene had been enacted  his absence panicstricken   thought  losing wendy  lost boys had advanced upon her threateningly “it   worse than before she came” they cried “we shan’t let her go” “let’s keep her prisoner” “ay chain her up” in her extremity  instinct told her  which  them  turn “tootles” she cried “i appeal  you” was  not strange she appealed  tootles quite  silliest one grandly however did tootles respond for  one moment  dropped his silliness  spoke  dignity “i am just tootles”  said “and nobody minds me but  first who does not behave  wendy like  english gentleman i  blood him severely” he drew back his hanger    instant his sun   noon the others held back uneasily then peter returned  they saw  once  they would get no support  him he would keep no girl   neverland against her will “wendy”  said striding up  down “i have asked  redskins  guide you through  wood  flying tires you so” “thank you peter” “then”  continued   short sharp voice  one accustomed   obeyed “tinker bell  take you across  sea wake her nibs” nibs had  knock twice before  got  answer though tink had really been sitting up  bed listening  some time “who  you how dare you go away” she cried “you   get up tink” nibs called “and take wendy   journey” of course tink had been delighted  hear  wendy  going but she  jolly well determined not   her courier  she said so  still more offensive language then she pretended   asleep again “she says she won’t” nibs exclaimed aghast  such insubordination whereupon peter went sternly toward  young lady’s chamber “tink”  rapped out “if you don’t get up  dress  once i  open  curtains  then we shall all see you  your negligée” this made her leap   floor “who said i wasn’t getting up” she cried in  meantime  boys  gazing very forlornly  wendy now equipped  john  michael   journey by this time they  dejected not merely because they  about  lose her but also because they felt  she  going off  something nice  which they had not been invited novelty  beckoning  them  usual crediting them   nobler feeling wendy melted “dear ones” she said “if you  all come  me i feel almost sure i can get my father  mother  adopt you” the invitation  meant specially  peter but each   boys  thinking exclusively  himself   once they jumped  joy “but won’t they think us rather  handful” nibs asked   middle  his jump “oh no” said wendy rapidly thinking  out “it  only mean having  few beds   drawingroom they can  hidden behind  screens  first thursdays” “peter can we go” they all cried imploringly they took   granted  if they went  would go also but really they scarcely cared thus children  ever ready when novelty knocks  desert their dearest ones “all right” peter replied   bitter smile  immediately they rushed  get their things “and now peter” wendy said thinking she had put everything right “i am going  give you your medicine before you go” she loved  give them medicine  undoubtedly gave them too much of course   only water but   out   bottle  she always shook  bottle  counted  drops which gave   certain medicinal quality on this occasion however she did not give peter his draught  just  she had prepared it she saw  look  his face  made her heart sink “get your things peter” she cried shaking “no”  answered pretending indifference “i am not going  you wendy” “yes peter” “no” to show  her departure would leave him unmoved  skipped up  down  room playing gaily  his heartless pipes she had  run about after him though   rather undignified “to find your mother” she coaxed now if peter had ever quite had  mother  no longer missed her he could do very well without one he had thought them out  remembered only their bad points “no no”  told wendy decisively “perhaps she would say i  old  i just want always    little boy   have fun” “but peter—” “no” and so  others had   told “peter isn’t coming” peter not coming they gazed blankly  him their sticks over their backs   each stick  bundle their first thought   if peter  not going  had probably changed his mind about letting them go but   far too proud  that “if you find your mothers”  said darkly “i hope you  like them” the awful cynicism  this made  uncomfortable impression  most  them began  look rather doubtful after all their faces said  they not noodles  want  go “now then” cried peter “no fuss no blubbering goodbye wendy”   held out his hand cheerily quite  if they must really go now   had something important  do she had  take his hand  there  no indication   would prefer  thimble “you  remember about changing your flannels peter” she said lingering over him she  always so particular about their flannels “yes” “and you  take your medicine” “yes” that seemed   everything   awkward pause followed peter however  not  kind  breaks down before other people “are you ready tinker bell”  called out “ay ay” “then lead  way” tink darted up  nearest tree but no one followed her     this moment   pirates made their dreadful attack upon  redskins above where all had been so still  air  rent  shrieks   clash  steel below there  dead silence mouths opened  remained open wendy fell  her knees but her arms  extended toward

but still  slept it must have been not less than ten o’clock   crocodile when  suddenly sat up  his bed wakened   knew not what it   soft cautious tapping   door  his tree soft  cautious but   stillness   sinister peter felt  his dagger till his hand gripped it then  spoke “who  that” for long there  no answer then again  knock “who  you” no answer he  thrilled   loved being thrilled in two strides  reached  door unlike slightly’s door  filled  aperture so   could not see beyond it nor could  one knocking see him “i won’t open unless you speak” peter cried then  last  visitor spoke   lovely belllike voice “let me in peter” it  tink  quickly  unbarred  her she flew  excitedly her face flushed  her dress stained  mud “what  it” “oh you could never guess” she cried  offered him three guesses “out  it”  shouted   one ungrammatical sentence  long   ribbons  conjurers pull  their mouths she told   capture  wendy   boys peter’s heart bobbed up  down   listened wendy bound    pirate ship she who loved everything   just so “i’ll rescue her”  cried leaping  his weapons as  leapt  thought  something  could do  please her he could take his medicine his hand closed   fatal draught “no” shrieked tinker bell who had heard hook mutter about his deed   sped through  forest “why not” “it  poisoned” “poisoned who could have poisoned it” “hook” “don’t  silly how could hook have got down here” alas tinker bell could not explain this  even she did not know  dark secret  slightly’s tree nevertheless hook’s words had left no room  doubt the cup  poisoned “besides” said peter quite believing himself “i never fell asleep” he raised  cup no time  words now time  deeds   one  her lightning movements tink got between his lips   draught  drained    dregs “why tink how dare you drink my medicine” but she did not answer already she  reeling   air “what   matter  you” cried peter suddenly afraid “it  poisoned peter” she told him softly “and now i am going   dead” “o tink did you drink   save me” “yes” “but why tink” her wings would scarcely carry her now but  reply she alighted  his shoulder  gave his nose  loving bite she whispered  his ear “you silly ass”  then tottering  her chamber lay down   bed his head almost filled  fourth wall  her little room   knelt near her  distress every moment her light  growing fainter   knew  if  went out she would  no more she liked his tears so much  she put out her beautiful finger  let them run over it her voice  so low   first  could not make out what she said then  made  out she  saying  she thought she could get well again if children believed  fairies peter flung out his arms there  no children there    night time but  addressed all who might  dreaming   neverland  who  therefore nearer  him than you think boys  girls  their nighties  naked papooses  their baskets hung  trees “do you believe”  cried tink sat up  bed almost briskly  listen  her fate she fancied she heard answers   affirmative  then again she wasn’t sure “what do you think” she asked peter “if you believe”  shouted  them “clap your hands don’t let tink die” many clapped some didn’t a few beasts hissed the clapping stopped suddenly  if countless mothers had rushed  their nurseries  see what  earth  happening but already tink  saved first her voice grew strong then she popped out  bed then she  flashing through  room more merry  impudent than ever she never thought  thanking those who believed but she would have liked  get   ones who had hissed “and now  rescue wendy” the moon  riding   cloudy heaven when peter rose  his tree begirt

terribly alone this inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded  his dogs they  socially inferior  him hook  not his true name to reveal who  really  would even  this date set  country

urged “and flint feared barbecue” “barbecue flint—what house” came  cutting retort most disquieting reflection  all   not bad form  think about good form his vitals  tortured  this problem it   claw within him sharper than  iron one    tore him  perspiration dripped down his tallow countenance  streaked his doublet ofttimes  drew his sleeve across his face but there  no damming  trickle ah envy not hook there came  him  presentiment  his early dissolution it   if peter’s terrible oath had boarded  ship hook felt  gloomy desire  make his dying speech lest presently there should  no time  it “better  hook”  cried “if  had had less ambition” it   his darkest hours only   referred  himself   third person “no little children  love me” strange   should think  this which had never troubled him before perhaps  sewing machine brought   his mind for long  muttered  himself staring  smee who  hemming placidly under  conviction  all children feared him feared him feared smee there  not  child  board  brig  night who did not already love him he had said horrid things  them  hit them   palm  his hand because  could not hit  his fist but they had only clung  him  more michael had tried  his spectacles to tell poor smee  they thought him lovable hook itched  do it but  seemed too brutal instead  revolved this mystery  his mind why do they find smee lovable he pursued  problem like  sleuthhound   was if smee  lovable what    made him so a terrible answer suddenly presented itself—“good form” had  bo’sun good form without knowing it which   best form  all he remembered  you have  prove you don’t know you have  before you  eligible  pop with  cry  rage  raised his iron hand over smee’s head but  did not tear what arrested him  this reflection “to claw  man because   good form what would  be” “bad form” the unhappy hook   impotent    damp   fell forward like  cut flower his dogs thinking him out   way   time discipline instantly relaxed  they broke into  bacchanalian dance which brought him  his feet  once all traces  human weakness gone  if  bucket  water had passed over him “quiet you scugs”  cried “or i’ll cast anchor  you”   once  din  hushed “are all  children chained so  they cannot fly away” “ay ay” “then hoist them up” the wretched prisoners  dragged   hold all except wendy  ranged  line  front  him for  time  seemed unconscious  their presence he lolled  his ease humming not unmelodiously snatches   rude song  fingering  pack  cards ever  anon  light  his cigar gave  touch  colour  his face “now then bullies”  said briskly “six  you walk  plank tonight but i have room  two cabin boys which  you    be” “don’t irritate him unnecessarily” had been wendy’s instructions   hold so tootles stepped forward politely tootles hated  idea  signing under such  man but  instinct told him   would  prudent  lay  responsibility   absent person  though  somewhat silly boy  knew  mothers alone  always willing    buffer all children know this about mothers  despise them  it but make constant use  it so tootles explained prudently “you see sir i don’t think my mother would like me    pirate would your mother like you    pirate slightly” he winked  slightly who said mournfully “i don’t think so”  if  wished things had been otherwise “would your mother like you    pirate twin” “i don’t think so” said  first twin  clever   others “nibs would—” “stow this gab” roared hook   spokesmen  dragged back “you boy”  said addressing john “you look  if you had  little pluck  you didst never want    pirate my hearty” now john had sometimes experienced this hankering  maths prep    struck  hook’s picking him out “i once thought  calling myself redhanded jack”  said diffidently “and  good name too we’ll call you  here bully if you join” “what do you think michael” asked john “what would you call me if i join” michael demanded “blackbeard joe” michael  naturally impressed “what do you think john” he wanted john  decide  john wanted him  decide “shall we still  respectful subjects   king” john inquired through hook’s teeth came  answer “you would have  swear ‘down   king’” perhaps john had not behaved very well so far but  shone out now “then i refuse”  cried banging  barrel  front  hook “and i refuse” cried michael “rule britannia” squeaked curly the infuriated pirates buffeted them   mouth  hook roared out “that seals your doom bring up their mother get  plank ready” they  only boys  they went white  they saw jukes  cecco preparing  fatal plank but they tried  look brave when wendy  brought up no words  mine can tell you how wendy despised those pirates to  boys there   least some glamour   pirate calling but all  she saw    ship had not been tidied  years there  not  porthole   grimy glass  which you might not have written  your finger “dirty pig”  she had already written   several but   boys gathered round her she had no thought  course save  them “so my beauty” said hook  if  spoke  syrup “you   see your children walk  plank” fine gentlemen though  was  intensity  his communings had soiled his ruff  suddenly  knew  she  gazing  it with  hasty gesture  tried  hide it but   too late “are they  die” asked wendy   look  such frightful contempt   nearly fainted “they are”  snarled “silence all”  called gloatingly “for  mother’s last words  her children” at this moment wendy  grand “these  my last words dear boys” she said firmly “i feel  i have  message  you  your real mothers    this ‘we hope our sons  die like english gentlemen’” even  pirates  awed  tootles cried out hysterically “i am going  do what my mother hopes what  you  do nibs” “what my mother hopes what  you  do twin” “what my mother hopes john what are—” but hook had found his voice again “tie her up”  shouted it  smee who tied her   mast “see here honey”  whispered “i’ll save you if you promise   my mother” but not even  smee would she make such  promise “i would almost rather have no children  all” she said disdainfully it  sad  know  not  boy  looking  her  smee tied her   mast  eyes  all    plank  last little walk they  about  take they  no longer able  hope  they would walk  manfully   capacity  think had gone  them they could stare  shiver only hook smiled  them  his teeth closed  took  step toward wendy his intention   turn her face so  she should see  boys walking  plank one  one but  never reached her  never heard  cry  anguish  hoped  wring  her he heard something else instead it   terrible ticktick   crocodile they all heard it—pirates boys wendy  immediately every head  blown  one direction not   water whence  sound proceeded but toward hook all knew  what  about  happen concerned him alone    being actors they  suddenly become spectators very frightful    see  change  came over him it   if  had been clipped  every joint he fell   little heap the sound came steadily nearer   advance   came this ghastly thought “the crocodile  about  board  ship” even  iron claw hung inactive  if knowing    no intrinsic part  what  attacking force wanted left so fearfully alone any other man would have lain  his eyes shut where  fell but  gigantic brain  hook  still working  under  guidance  crawled   knees along  deck  far   sound   could go the pirates respectfully cleared  passage  him    only when  brought up against  bulwarks   spoke “hide me”  cried hoarsely they gathered round him all eyes averted   thing   coming aboard they had no thought  fighting it it  fate only when hook  hidden  them did curiosity loosen  limbs   boys so  they could rush   ship’s side  see  crocodile climbing it then they got  strangest surprise   night  nights    no crocodile   coming  their aid it  peter he signed  them not  give vent  any cry  admiration  might rouse suspicion then  went  ticking chapter xv “hook or me this time” odd things happen  all  us  our way through life without our noticing   time  they have happened thus  take  instance we suddenly discover  we have been deaf  one ear  we don’t know how long but say half  hour now such  experience had come  night  peter when last we saw him   stealing across  island  one finger  his lips  his dagger   ready he had seen  crocodile pass  without noticing anything peculiar about it but     remembered   had not been ticking at first  thought this eerie but soon concluded rightly   clock had run down without giving  thought  what might   feelings   fellowcreature thus abruptly deprived   closest companion peter began  consider how  could turn  catastrophe  his own use   decided  tick so  wild beasts should believe    crocodile  let him pass unmolested he ticked superbly but  one unforeseen result the crocodile  among those who heard  sound   followed him though whether   purpose  regaining what  had lost or merely   friend under  belief    again ticking itself  never  certainly known for like slaves   fixed idea    stupid beast peter reached  shore without mishap  went straight on his legs encountering  water  if quite unaware  they had entered  new element thus many animals pass  land  water but no other human  whom i know as  swam  had but one thought “hook or me this time” he had ticked so long   now went  ticking without knowing    doing it had  known  would have stopped   board  brig  help   tick though  ingenious idea had not occurred  him on  contrary  thought  had scaled her side  noiseless   mouse    amazed  see  pirates cowering  him  hook  their midst  abject  if  had heard  crocodile the crocodile no sooner did peter remember  than  heard  ticking at first  thought  sound did come   crocodile   looked behind him swiftly then  realised    doing  himself    flash  understood  situation “how clever  me”  thought  once  signed   boys not  burst into applause it   this moment  ed teynte  quartermaster emerged   forecastle  came along  deck now reader time what happened  your watch peter struck true  deep john clapped his hands   illfated pirate’s mouth  stifle  dying groan he fell forward four boys caught him  prevent  thud peter gave  signal   carrion  cast overboard there   splash  then silence how long   taken “one” slightly had begun  count none too soon peter every inch  him  tiptoe vanished into  cabin  more than one pirate  screwing up his courage  look round they could hear each other’s distressed breathing now which showed them   more terrible sound had passed “it’s gone captain” smee said wiping off his spectacles “all’s still again” slowly hook let his head emerge  his ruff  listened so intently   could have caught  echo   tick there  not  sound   drew himself up firmly  his full height “then here’s  johnny plank”  cried brazenly hating  boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend he broke into  villainous ditty “yo ho yo ho  frisky plank you walks along  so till  goes down  you goes down to davy jones below” to terrorise  prisoners  more though   certain loss  dignity  danced along  imaginary plank grimacing  them   sang  when  finished  cried “do you want  touch   cat before you walk  plank” at  they fell  their knees “no no” they cried so piteously  every pirate smiled “fetch  cat jukes” said hook “it’s   cabin” the cabin peter    cabin the children gazed  each other “ay ay” said jukes blithely   strode into  cabin they followed him  their eyes they scarce knew  hook had resumed his song his dogs joining   him “yo ho yo ho  scratching cat its tails  nine you know and when they’re writ upon your back—” what   last line  never  known    sudden  song  stayed   dreadful screech   cabin it wailed through  ship  died away then  heard  crowing sound which  well understood   boys but   pirates  almost more eerie than  screech “what  that” cried hook “two” said slightly solemnly the italian cecco hesitated   moment  then swung into  cabin he tottered out haggard “what’s  matter  bill jukes you dog” hissed hook towering over him “the matter wi’ him  he’s dead stabbed” replied cecco   hollow voice “bill jukes dead” cried  startled pirates “the cabin’s  black   pit” cecco said almost gibbering “but there  something terrible  there  thing you heard crowing” the exultation   boys  lowering looks   pirates both  seen  hook “cecco”  said  his most steely voice “go back  fetch me out  doodledoo” cecco bravest   brave cowered before his captain crying “no no” but hook  purring  his claw “did you say you would go cecco”  said musingly cecco went first flinging his arms despairingly there  no more singing all listened now  again came  deathscreech  again  crow no one spoke except slightly “three”  said hook rallied his dogs   gesture “’s’death  odds fish”  thundered “who   bring me  doodledoo” “wait till cecco comes out” growled starkey   others took up  cry “i think i heard you volunteer starkey” said hook purring again “no  thunder” starkey cried “my hook thinks you did” said hook crossing  him “i wonder if  would not  advisable starkey  humour  hook” “i’ll swing before i go  there” replied starkey doggedly  again  had  support   crew “is this mutiny” asked hook more pleasantly than ever “starkey’s ringleader” “captain mercy” starkey whimpered all   tremble now “shake hands starkey” said hook proffering his claw starkey looked round  help but all deserted him as  backed up hook advanced  now  red spark   his eye with  despairing scream  pirate leapt upon long tom  precipitated himself into  sea “four” said slightly “and now” hook said courteously “did any other gentlemen say mutiny” seizing  lantern  raising his claw   menacing gesture “i’ll bring out  doodledoo myself”  said  sped into  cabin “five” how slightly longed  say it he wetted his lips   ready but hook came staggering out without his lantern “something blew out  light”  said  little unsteadily “something” echoed mullins “what  cecco” demanded noodler “he’s  dead  jukes” said hook shortly his reluctance  return   cabin impressed them all unfavourably   mutinous sounds again broke forth all pirates  superstitious  cookson cried “they do say  surest sign  ship’s accurst  when there’s one  board more than can  accounted for” “i’ve heard” muttered mullins “he always boards  pirate craft last had   tail captain” “they say” said another looking viciously  hook “that when  comes it’s   likeness   wickedest man aboard” “had   hook captain” asked cookson insolently  one after another took up  cry “the ship’s doomed” at this  children could not resist raising  cheer hook had wellnigh forgotten his prisoners but   swung round  them now his face lit up again “lads”  cried  his crew “now here’s  notion open  cabin door  drive them in let them fight  doodledoo  their lives if they kill him we’re so much  better if  kills them we’re none  worse” for  last time his dogs admired hook  devotedly they did his bidding the boys pretending  struggle  pushed into  cabin   door  closed  them “now listen” cried hook  all listened but not one dared  face  door yes one wendy who all this time had been bound   mast it   neither  scream nor  crow  she  watching     reappearance  peter she had not long  wait in  cabin  had found  thing  which  had gone  search  key  would free  children  their manacles  now they all stole forth armed  such weapons  they could find first signing them  hide peter cut wendy’s bonds  then nothing could have been easier than  them all  fly off together but one thing barred  way  oath “hook or me this time” so when  had freed wendy  whispered  her  conceal herself   others  himself took her place   mast her cloak around him so   should pass  her then  took  great breath  crowed to  pirates    voice crying  all  boys lay slain   cabin  they  panicstricken hook tried  hearten them but like  dogs  had made them they showed him their fangs   knew  if  took his eyes off them now they would leap  him “lads”  said ready  cajole or strike  need be but never quailing   instant “i’ve thought  out there’s  jonah aboard” “ay” they snarled “a man wi’  hook” “no lads no it’s  girl never  luck   pirate ship wi’  woman  board we’ll right  ship when she’s gone” some  them remembered  this had been  saying  flint’s “it’s worth trying” they said doubtfully “fling  girl overboard” cried hook  they made  rush   figure   cloak “there’s none can save you now missy” mullins hissed jeeringly “there’s one” replied  figure “who’s that” “peter pan  avenger” came  terrible answer    spoke peter flung off his cloak then they all knew who ’twas  had been undoing them   cabin  twice hook essayed  speak  twice  failed in  frightful moment i think his fierce heart broke at last  cried “cleave him   brisket” but without conviction “down boys   them” peter’s voice rang out   another moment  clash  arms  resounding through  ship had  pirates kept together   certain  they would have won but  onset came when they  still unstrung  they ran hither  thither striking wildly each thinking himself  last survivor   crew man  man they   stronger but they fought   defensive only which enabled  boys  hunt  pairs  choose their quarry some   miscreants leapt into  sea others hid  dark recesses where they  found  slightly who did not fight but ran about   lantern which  flashed  their faces so  they  half blinded  fell   easy prey   reeking swords   other boys there  little sound   heard but  clang  weapons  occasional screech or splash  slightly monotonously counting—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten—eleven i think all  gone when  group  savage boys surrounded hook who seemed  have  charmed life   kept them  bay   circle  fire they had done  his dogs but this man alone seemed    match  them all again  again they closed upon him  again  again  hewed  clear space he had lifted up one boy  his hook   using him   buckler when another who had just passed his sword through mullins sprang into  fray “put up your swords boys” cried  newcomer “this man  mine” thus suddenly hook found himself face  face  peter the others drew back  formed  ring around them for long  two enemies looked  one another hook shuddering slightly  peter   strange smile upon his face “so pan” said hook  last “this  all your doing” “ay james hook” came  stern answer “it  all my doing” “proud  insolent youth” said hook “prepare  meet thy doom” “dark  sinister man” peter answered “have  thee” without more words they fell to    space there  no advantage  either blade peter   superb swordsman  parried  dazzling rapidity ever  anon  followed up  feint   lunge  got past his foe’s defence but his shorter reach stood him  ill stead   could not drive  steel home hook scarcely his inferior  brilliancy but not quite so nimble  wrist play forced him back   weight  his onset hoping suddenly  end all   favourite thrust taught him long ago  barbecue  rio but  his astonishment  found this thrust turned aside again  again then  sought  close  give  quietus  his iron hook which all this time had been pawing  air but peter doubled under  and lunging fiercely pierced him   ribs at  sight  his own blood whose peculiar colour you remember  offensive  him  sword fell  hook’s hand     peter’s mercy “now” cried all  boys but   magnificent gesture peter invited his opponent  pick up his sword hook did so instantly but   tragic feeling  peter  showing good form hitherto  had thought   some fiend fighting him but darker suspicions assailed him now “pan who  what art thou”  cried huskily “i’m youth i’m joy” peter answered   venture “i’m  little bird   broken out   egg” this  course  nonsense but   proof   unhappy hook  peter did not know   least who or what  was which   very pinnacle  good form “to’t again”  cried despairingly he fought now like  human flail  every sweep   terrible sword would have severed  twain any man or boy who obstructed it but peter fluttered round him  if  very wind  made blew him out   danger zone and again  again  darted   pricked hook  fighting now without hope that passionate breast no longer asked  life but  one boon  craved  see peter show bad form before   cold forever abandoning  fight  rushed into  powder magazine  fired it “in two minutes”  cried “the ship   blown  pieces” now now  thought true form  show but peter issued   powder magazine   shell  his hands  calmly flung  overboard what sort  form  hook himself showing misguided man though  was we may  glad without sympathising  him    end   true   traditions  his race the other boys  flying around him now flouting scornful   staggered about  deck striking up  them impotently his mind  no longer  them   slouching   playing fields  long ago or being sent up  good or watching  wallgame   famous wall and his shoes  right  his waistcoat  right  his tie  right  his socks  right james hook thou not wholly unheroic figure farewell for we have come  his last moment seeing peter slowly advancing upon him through  air  dagger poised  sprang upon  bulwarks  cast himself into  sea he did not know   crocodile  waiting  him  we purposely stopped  clock  this knowledge might  spared him  little mark  respect  us   end he had one last triumph which i think we need not grudge him as  stood   bulwark looking over his shoulder  peter gliding through  air  invited him   gesture  use his foot it made peter kick instead  stab at last hook had got  boon  which  craved “bad form”  cried jeeringly  went content   crocodile thus perished james

then she took them into hook’s cabin  pointed  his watch which  hanging   nail it said “halfpast one” the lateness   hour  almost  biggest thing  all she got them  bed   pirates’ bunks pretty quickly

perplexed when told  take soundings the general feeling   peter  honest just now  lull wendy’s suspicions but  there might   change when  new suit  ready which against her will she  making  him out  some  hook’s wickedest garments it  afterwards whispered among them    first night  wore this suit  sat long   cabin  hook’s cigarholder  his mouth  one hand clenched all but   forefinger which  bent  held threateningly aloft like  hook instead  watching  ship however we must now return   desolate home  which three  our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago it seems  shame  have neglected no  all this time  yet we may  sure  mrs darling does not blame us if we had returned sooner  look  sorrowful sympathy  her she would probably have cried “don’t  silly what do i matter do go back  keep  eye   children” so long  mothers  like this their children  take advantage  them  they may lay  that even now we venture into  familiar nursery only because  lawful occupants   their way home we  merely hurrying   advance  them  see  their beds  properly aired   mr  mrs darling do not go out   evening we  no more than servants why  earth should their beds  properly aired seeing  they left them  such  thankless hurry would  not serve them jolly well right if they came back  found  their parents  spending  weekend   country it would   moral lesson they have been  need  ever since we met them but if we contrived things  this way mrs darling would never forgive us one thing i should like  do immensely     tell her   way authors have   children  coming back  indeed they   here  thursday week this would spoil so completely  surprise  which wendy  john  michael  looking forward they have been planning  out   ship mother’s rapture father’s shout  joy nana’s leap through  air  embrace them first when what they ought   prepared    good hiding how delicious  spoil  all  breaking  news  advance so  when they enter grandly mrs darling may not even offer wendy her mouth  mr darling may exclaim pettishly “dash  all here  those boys again” however we should get no thanks even  this we  beginning  know mrs darling  this time  may  sure  she would upbraid us  depriving  children  their little pleasure “but my dear madam   ten days till thursday week so   telling you what’s what we can save you ten days  unhappiness” “yes but  what  cost by depriving  children  ten minutes  delight” “oh if you look     way” “what other way  there  which  look  it” you see  woman had no proper spirit i had meant  say extraordinarily nice things about her but i despise her  not one  them  i say now she does not really need   told  have things ready  they  ready all  beds  aired  she never leaves  house  observe  window  open for all  use we   her we might well go back   ship however  we  here we may  well stay  look on that  all we are lookerson nobody really wants us so let us watch  say jaggy things   hope  some  them  hurt the only change   seen   nightnursery   between nine  six  kennel  no longer there when  children flew away mr darling felt  his bones  all  blame  his  having chained nana up    first  last she had been wiser than he of course  we have seen   quite  simple man indeed  might have passed   boy again if  had been able  take his baldness off but  had also  noble sense  justice   lion’s courage  do what seemed right  him  having thought  matter out  anxious care after  flight   children  went down  all fours  crawled into  kennel to all mrs darling’s dear invitations  him  come out  replied sadly but firmly “no my own one this   place  me” in  bitterness  his remorse  swore   would never leave  kennel until his children came back of course this   pity but whatever mr darling did  had  do  excess otherwise  soon gave up doing it and there never   more humble man than  once proud george darling   sat   kennel   evening talking  his wife  their children  all their pretty ways very touching  his deference  nana he would not let her come into  kennel but  all other matters  followed her wishes implicitly every morning  kennel  carried  mr darling     cab which conveyed him  his office   returned home   same way  six something   strength  character   man   seen if we remember how sensitive     opinion  neighbours this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention inwardly  must have suffered torture but  preserved  calm exterior even when  young criticised his little home   always lifted his hat courteously  any lady who looked inside it may have been quixotic but   magnificent soon  inward meaning   leaked out   great heart   public  touched crowds followed  cab cheering  lustily charming girls scaled   get his autograph interviews appeared   better class  papers  society invited him  dinner  added “do come   kennel” on  eventful thursday week mrs darling    nightnursery awaiting george’s return home  very sadeyed woman now  we look  her closely  remember  gaiety  her   old days all gone now just because she  lost her babes i find i won’t  able  say nasty things about her after all if she  too fond  her rubbishy children she couldn’t help it look  her  her chair where she  fallen asleep the corner  her mouth where one looks first  almost withered up her hand moves restlessly  her breast  if she had  pain there some like peter best  some like wendy best but i like her best suppose  make her happy we whisper  her  her sleep   brats  coming back they  really within two miles   window now  flying strong but all we need whisper   they    way let’s it   pity we did it  she  started up calling their names  there  no one   room but nana “o nana i dreamt my dear ones had come back” nana had filmy eyes but all she could do  put her paw gently  her mistress’s lap  they  sitting together thus when  kennel  brought back as mr darling puts his head out  kiss his wife we see  his face  more worn than  yore but   softer expression he gave his hat  liza who took  scornfully  she had no imagination   quite incapable  understanding  motives  such  man outside  crowd who had accompanied  cab home  still cheering    naturally not unmoved “listen  them”  said “it  very gratifying” “lots  little boys” sneered liza “there  several adults today”  assured her   faint flush but when she tossed her head  had not  word  reproof  her social success had not spoilt him  had made him sweeter for some time  sat  his head out   kennel talking  mrs darling  this success  pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not  turned  it “but if i had been  weak man”  said “good heavens if i had been  weak man” “and george” she said timidly “you   full  remorse  ever aren’t you” “full  remorse  ever dearest see my punishment living   kennel” “but   punishment isn’t it george you  sure you  not enjoying it” “my love” you may  sure she begged his pardon  then feeling drowsy  curled round   kennel “won’t you play me  sleep”  asked “on  nursery piano”   she  crossing   daynursery  added thoughtlessly “and shut  window i feel  draught” “o george never ask me  do that the window must always  left open  them always always” now   his turn  beg her pardon  she went into  daynursery  played  soon   asleep  while  slept wendy  john  michael flew into  room oh no we have written  so because    charming arrangement planned  them before we left  ship but something must have happened since then    not they who have flown in   peter  tinker bell peter’s first words tell all “quick tink”  whispered “close  window bar it that’s right now you  i must get away   door  when wendy comes she  think her mother  barred her out  she  have  go back  me” now i understand what had hitherto puzzled me why when peter had exterminated  pirates  did not return   island  leave tink  escort  children   mainland this trick had been  his head all  time instead  feeling    behaving badly  danced  glee then  peeped into  daynursery  see who  playing he whispered  tink “it’s wendy’s mother she   pretty lady but not so pretty  my mother her mouth  full  thimbles but not so full  my mother’s was” of course  knew nothing whatever about his mother but  sometimes bragged about her he did not know  tune which  “home sweet home” but  knew   saying “come back wendy wendy wendy”   cried exultantly “you  never see wendy again lady   window  barred” he peeped  again  see why  music had stopped  now  saw  mrs darling had laid her head   box   two tears  sitting  her eyes “she wants me  unbar  window” thought peter “but i won’t not i” he peeped again   tears  still there or another two had taken their place “she’s awfully fond  wendy”  said  himself he  angry  her now  not seeing why she could not have wendy the reason  so simple “i’m fond  her too we can’t both have her lady” but  lady would not make  best  it    unhappy he ceased  look  her but even then she would not let go  him he skipped about  made funny faces but when  stopped   just  if she  inside him knocking “oh all right”  said  last  gulped then  unbarred  window “come on tink”  cried   frightful sneer   laws  nature “we don’t want any silly mothers”   flew away thus wendy  john  michael found  window open  them after all which  course  more than they deserved they alighted   floor quite unashamed  themselves   youngest one had already forgotten his home “john”  said looking around him doubtfully “i think i have been here before” “of course you have you silly there  your old bed” “so  is” michael said but not  much conviction “i say” cried john “the kennel”   dashed across  look into it “perhaps nana  inside it” wendy said but john whistled “hullo”  said “there’s  man inside it” “it’s father” exclaimed wendy “let me see father” michael begged eagerly   took  good look “he  not so big   pirate i killed”  said  such frank disappointment  i am glad mr darling  asleep  would have been sad if those had been  first words  heard his little michael say wendy  john had been taken aback somewhat  finding their father   kennel “surely” said john like one who had lost faith  his memory “he used not  sleep   kennel” “john” wendy said falteringly “perhaps we don’t remember  old life  well  we thought we did” a chill fell upon them  serve them right “it  very careless  mother” said  young scoundrel john “not   here when we come back” it  then  mrs darling began playing again “it’s mother” cried wendy peeping “so  is” said john “then  you not really our mother wendy” asked michael who  surely sleepy “oh dear” exclaimed wendy  her first real twinge  remorse “it  quite time we came back” “let us creep in” john suggested “and put our hands over her eyes” but wendy who saw  they must break  joyous news more gently had  better plan “let us all slip into our beds   there when she comes in just  if we had never been away” and so when mrs darling went back   nightnursery  see if her husband  asleep all  beds  occupied the children waited  her cry  joy but  did not come she saw them but she did not believe they  there you see she saw them  their beds so often  her dreams  she thought this  just  dream hanging around her still she sat down   chair   fire where   old days she had nursed them they could not understand this   cold fear fell upon all  three  them “mother” wendy cried “that’s wendy” she said but still she  sure    dream “mother” “that’s john” she said “mother” cried michael he knew her now “that’s michael” she said  she stretched out her arms   three little selfish children they would never envelop again yes they did they went round wendy  john  michael who had slipped out  bed  run  her “george george” she cried when she could speak  mr darling woke  share her bliss  nana came rushing in there could not have been  lovelier sight but there  none  see  except  little boy who  staring    window he had had ecstasies innumerable  other children can never know but   looking through  window   one joy  which  must   ever barred chapter xvii when wendy grew up i hope you want  know what became   other boys they  waiting below  give wendy time  explain about them  when they had counted five hundred they went up they went up   stair because they thought this would make  better impression they stood   row  front  mrs darling  their hats off  wishing they  not wearing their pirate clothes they said nothing but their eyes asked her  have them they ought  have looked  mr darling also but they forgot about him of course mrs darling said  once  she would have them but mr darling  curiously depressed  they saw   considered six  rather large number “i must say”  said  wendy “that you don’t do things  halves”  grudging remark which  twins thought  pointed  them the first twin   proud one   asked flushing “do you think we should  too much   handful sir because if so we can go away” “father” wendy cried shocked but still  cloud   him he knew   behaving unworthily but  could not help it “we could lie doubled up” said nibs “i always cut their hair myself” said wendy “george” mrs darling exclaimed pained  see her dear one showing himself  such  unfavourable light then  burst into tears   truth came out he   glad  have them  she was  said but  thought they should have asked his consent  well  hers instead  treating him   cypher  his own house “i don’t think    cypher” tootles cried instantly “do you think    cypher curly” “no i don’t do you think    cypher slightly” “rather not twin what do you think” it turned out  not one  them thought him  cypher    absurdly gratified  said  would find space  them all   drawingroom if they fitted in “we’ll fit in sir” they assured him “then follow  leader”  cried gaily “mind you i am not sure  we have  drawingroom but we pretend we have  it’s all  same hoop la” he went off dancing through  house  they all cried “hoop la”  danced after him searching   drawingroom  i forget whether they found it but  any rate they found corners  they all fitted in as  peter  saw wendy once again before  flew away he did not exactly come   window but  brushed against   passing so  she could open  if she liked  call  him that  what she did “hullo wendy goodbye”  said “oh dear  you going away” “yes” “you don’t feel peter” she said falteringly “that you would like  say anything  my parents about  very sweet subject” “no” “about me peter” “no” mrs darling came   window   present she  keeping  sharp eye  wendy she told peter  she had adopted all  other boys  would like  adopt him also “would you send me  school”  inquired craftily “yes” “and then   office” “i suppose so” “soon i would   man” “very soon” “i don’t want  go  school  learn solemn things”  told her passionately “i don’t want    man o wendy’s mother if i   wake up  feel there   beard” “peter” said wendy  comforter “i should love you   beard”  mrs darling stretched out her arms  him but  repulsed her “keep back lady no one  going  catch me  make me  man” “but where  you going  live” “with tink   house we built  wendy the fairies   put  high up among  tree tops where they sleep  nights” “how lovely” cried wendy so longingly  mrs darling tightened her grip “i thought all  fairies  dead” mrs darling said “there  always  lot  young ones” explained wendy who  now quite  authority “because you see when  new baby laughs   first time  new fairy  born   there  always new babies there  always new fairies they live  nests   tops  trees   mauve ones  boys   white ones  girls   blue ones  just little sillies who  not sure what they are” “i shall have such fun” said peter  eye  wendy “it   rather lonely   evening” she said “sitting   fire” “i shall have tink” “tink can’t go  twentieth part   way round” she reminded him  little tartly “sneaky telltale” tink called out  somewhere round  corner “it doesn’t matter” peter said “o peter you know  matters” “well then come  me   little house” “may i mummy” “certainly not i have got you home again  i mean  keep you” “but  does so need  mother” “so do you my love” “oh all right” peter said  if  had asked her  politeness merely but mrs darling saw his mouth twitch  she made this handsome offer  let wendy go  him   week every year  do his spring cleaning wendy would have preferred  more permanent arrangement   seemed  her  spring would  long  coming but this promise sent peter away quite gay again he had no sense  time   so full  adventures  all i have told you about him  only  halfpennyworth  them i suppose   because wendy knew this  her last words  him  these rather plaintive ones “you won’t forget me peter  you before spring cleaning time comes” of course peter promised  then  flew away he took mrs darling’s kiss  him the kiss  had been  no one else peter took quite easily funny but she seemed satisfied of course all  boys went  school  most  them got into class iii but slightly  put first into class iv  then into class v class i   top class before they had attended school  week they saw what goats they had been not  remain   island but   too late now  soon they settled down  being  ordinary  you or me or jenkins minor it  sad  have  say   power  fly gradually left them at first nana tied their feet   bedposts so  they should not fly away   night  one  their diversions  day   pretend  fall off buses but    they ceased  tug  their bonds  bed  found  they hurt themselves when they let go   bus in time they could not even fly after their hats want  practice they called it but what  really meant   they no longer believed michael believed longer than  other boys though they jeered  him so    wendy when peter came  her   end   first year she flew away  peter   frock she had woven  leaves  berries   neverland  her one fear    might notice how short  had become but  never noticed  had so much  say about himself she had looked forward  thrilling talks  him about old times but new adventures had crowded  old ones  his mind “who  captain hook”  asked  interest when she spoke   arch enemy “don’t you remember” she asked amazed “how you killed him  saved all our lives” “i forget them after i kill them”  replied carelessly when she expressed  doubtful hope  tinker bell would  glad  see her  said “who  tinker bell” “o peter” she said shocked but even when she explained  could not remember “there  such  lot  them”  said “i expect she  no more” i expect   right  fairies don’t live long but they  so little   short time seems  good while  them wendy  pained too  find   past year  but  yesterday  peter  had seemed such  long year  waiting  her but   exactly  fascinating  ever  they had  lovely spring cleaning   little house   tree tops next year  did not come  her she waited   new frock because  old one simply would not meet but  never came “perhaps   ill” michael said “you know   never ill” michael came close  her  whispered   shiver “perhaps there  no such person wendy”  then wendy would have cried if michael had not been crying peter came next spring cleaning   strange thing    never knew  had missed  year that   last time  girl wendy ever saw him for  little longer she tried  his sake not  have growing pains  she felt she  untrue  him when she got  prize  general knowledge but  years came  went without bringing  careless boy  when they met again wendy   married woman  peter  no more  her than  little dust   box  which she had kept her toys wendy  grown up you need not  sorry  her she  one   kind  likes  grow up in  end she grew up  her own free   day quicker than other girls all  boys  grown up  done   this time so   scarcely worth while saying anything more about them you may see  twins  nibs  curly any day going   office each carrying  little bag   umbrella michael   enginedriver slightly married  lady  title  so  became  lord you see  judge   wig coming out   iron door that used   tootles the bearded man who doesn’t know any story  tell his children  once john wendy  married  white   pink sash it  strange  think  peter did not alight   church  forbid  banns years rolled  again  wendy had  daughter this ought not   written  ink but   golden splash she  called jane  always had  odd inquiring look  if   moment she arrived   mainland she wanted  ask questions when she  old enough  ask them they  mostly about peter pan she loved  hear  peter  wendy told her all she could remember   very nursery  which  famous flight had taken place it  jane’s nursery now  her father had bought    three per cents  wendy’s father who  no longer fond  stairs mrs darling  now dead  forgotten there  only two beds   nursery now jane’s  her nurse’s  there  no kennel  nana also had passed away she died  old age    end she had been rather difficult  get  with being very firmly convinced  no one knew how  look after children except herself once  week jane’s nurse had her evening off  then   wendy’s part  put jane  bed that   time  stories it  jane’s invention  raise  sheet over her mother’s head  her own thus making  tent    awful darkness  whisper “what do we see now” “i don’t think i see anything tonight” says wendy   feeling  if nana  here she would object  further conversation “yes you do” says jane “you see when you   little girl” “that   long time ago sweetheart” says wendy “ah me how time flies” “does  fly” asks  artful child “the way you flew when you   little girl” “the way i flew do you know jane i sometimes wonder whether i ever did really fly” “yes you did” “the dear old days when i could fly” “why can’t you fly now mother” “because i am grown up dearest when people grow up they forget  way” “why do they forget  way” “because they  no longer gay  innocent  heartless it  only  gay  innocent  heartless who can fly” “what  gay  innocent  heartless i do wish i  gay  innocent  heartless” or perhaps wendy admits she does see something “i do believe” she says “that   this nursery” “i do believe  is” says jane “go on” they  now embarked   great adventure   night when peter flew  looking  his shadow “the foolish fellow” says wendy “tried  stick    soap  when  could not  cried   woke me  i sewed    him” “you have missed  bit” interrupts jane who now knows  story better than her mother “when you saw him sitting   floor crying what did you say” “i sat up  bed  i said ‘boy why  you crying’” “yes   it” says jane   big breath “and then  flew us all away   neverland   fairies   pirates   redskins   mermaids’ lagoon   home under  ground   little house” “yes which did you like best  all” “i think i liked  home under  ground best  all” “yes so do i what   last thing peter ever said  you” “the last thing  ever said  me was ‘just always  waiting  me  then some night you  hear me crowing’” “yes” “but alas  forgot all about me” wendy said    smile she   grown up  that “what did his crow sound like” jane asked one evening “it  like this” wendy said trying  imitate peter’s crow “no  wasn’t” jane said gravely “it  like this”  she did  ever so much better than her mother wendy   little startled “my darling how can you know” “i often hear  when i am sleeping” jane said “ah yes many girls hear  when they  sleeping but i   only one who heard  awake” “lucky you” said jane and then one night came  tragedy it   spring   year   story had been told   night  jane  now asleep  her bed wendy  sitting   floor very close   fire so   see  darn  there  no other light   nursery  while she sat darning she heard  crow then  window blew open   old  peter dropped    floor he  exactly  same  ever  wendy saw  once   still had all his first teeth he   little boy  she  grown up she huddled   fire not daring  move helpless  guilty  big woman “hullo wendy”  said not noticing any difference    thinking chiefly  himself    dim light her white dress might have been  nightgown  which  had seen her first “hullo peter” she replied faintly squeezing herself  small  possible something inside her  crying “woman woman let go  me” “hullo where  john”  asked suddenly missing  third bed “john  not here now” she gasped “is michael asleep”  asked   careless glance  jane “yes” she answered  now she felt  she  untrue  jane  well   peter “that  not michael” she said quickly lest  judgment should fall  her peter looked “hullo    new one” “yes” “boy or girl” “girl” now surely  would understand but not  bit  it “peter” she said faltering “are you expecting me  fly away  you” “of course   why i have come” he added  little sternly “have you forgotten  this  spring cleaning time” she knew   useless  say   had let many spring cleaning times pass “i can’t come” she said apologetically “i have forgotten how  fly” “i’ll soon teach you again” “o peter don’t waste  fairy dust  me” she had risen  now  last  fear assailed him “what  it”  cried shrinking “i  turn up  light” she said “and then you can see  yourself” for almost  only time  his life  i know of peter  afraid “don’t turn up  light”  cried she let her hands play   hair   tragic boy she  not  little girl heartbroken about him she   grown woman smiling   all but they  weteyed smiles then she turned up  light  peter saw he gave  cry  pain  when  tall beautiful creature stooped  lift him  her arms  drew back sharply “what  it”  cried again she had  tell him “i am old peter i am ever so much more than twenty i grew up long ago” “you promised not to” “i couldn’t help it i am  married woman peter” “no you’re not” “yes   little girl   bed  my baby” “no she’s not” but  supposed she was   took  step towards  sleeping child  his dagger upraised of course  did not strike he sat down   floor instead  sobbed  wendy did not know how  comfort him though she could have done  so easily once she  only  woman now  she ran out   room  try  think peter continued  cry  soon his sobs woke jane she sat up  bed   interested  once “boy” she said “why  you crying” peter rose  bowed  her  she bowed  him   bed “hullo”  said “hullo” said jane “my name  peter pan”  told her “yes i know” “i came back  my mother”  explained “to take her   neverland” “yes i know” jane said “i have been waiting  you” when wendy returned diffidently she found peter sitting   bedpost crowing gloriously while jane  her nighty  flying round  room  solemn ecstasy “she  my mother” peter explained  jane descended  stood  his side   look  her face   liked  see  ladies when they gazed  him “he does so need  mother” jane said “yes i know” wendy admitted rather forlornly “no one knows  so well  i” “goodbye” said peter  wendy   rose   air   shameless jane rose  him   already her easiest way  moving about wendy rushed   window “no no” she cried “it  just  spring cleaning time” jane said “he wants me always  do his spring cleaning” “if only i could go  you” wendy sighed “you see you can’t fly” said jane of course   end wendy let them fly away together our last glimpse  her shows her   window watching them receding into  sky until they   small  stars as you look  wendy you may see her hair becoming white  her figure little again  all this happened long ago jane  now  common grownup   daughter called margaret  every spring cleaning time except when  forgets peter comes  margaret  takes her   neverland where she tells him stories about
