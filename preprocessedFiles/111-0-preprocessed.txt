regretted  question  minute   asked “i dont know” answered freckles the reply sounded so hopeless even  his own ears   hastened  qualify   adding “you see its like this sir kindnesses  people  paid

replied freckles “the home   chicago  i  there all me life until three months ago when i  too old   training they gave   little children they sent me   closest ward school  long   law would let them

mustache  hide  smile  his lips but  liked  boy all  better  this confession “i didnt even have  steal clothes  get rid  starting  me home ones” freckles continued “for they had already taken all me clean neat things   boy  put me into his rags   went almost  sore   beatings  where i  we  always kept tidy  sweetsmelling anyway i hustled clear into this state before i learned  man couldnt have

forward  step “if you  give me  job where i can earn me food clothes   place  sleep”  said “if i can have  boss  work  like other men   place i feel ive  right to i  do precisely what you tell me or die trying” he spoke so convincingly  mclean believed although  his heart  knew   employ  stranger would  wretched business   man   interests  had involved “very well”  boss found himself answering “i

know what mine is  i never will but i am going   your man  do your work  ill  glad  answer  any name you choose  call me wont you please  giving me  name mr mclean” the boss wheeled abruptly  began stacking his books what   thinking  probably what any other gentleman would have thought   circumstances with his eyes still downcast    voice harsh  huskiness  spoke “i  tell you what we  do my lad”  said “my father  my ideal man  i loved him better than any other i have ever known he went out five years ago but   would have been proud  leave you his name i firmly believe if i give  you  name  my nearest kin   man i loved bestwill  do” freckles rigid attitude relaxed suddenly his head dropped  big tears splashed   soiled calico shirt mclean  not surprised   silence   found  talking came none too easily just then “all right”  said “i  write    rolljames ross mclean” “thank you mightily” said freckles “that makes me feel almost  if i belonged already” “you do” said mclean “until someone

large open space there  no wind  carry it from  clear sky  had fallen  freckles gazing eagerly into  arch  june blue   few lazy clouds floating high   sea  ether had neither mind nor knowledge  dream   bird hanging  if frozen there he turned  big quill questioningly  again his awed eyes swept  sky “a feather dropped  heaven”  breathed reverently “are  holy angels moulting but no if they were  would  white maybe all  angels  not  being white what if  angels  god  white  those   devil  black but  black one  no business up there maybe some poor black angel  so tired  being punished its  slipping

wondering about it it   wing quill eighteen inches  length   heavy spine gray   base shading  jet black   tip   caught  play   suns rays  slanting gleams  green  bronze again freckles “old man   sea”

unseeing eyes so intently   thinking before him spread  large green pool filled  rotting logs  leaves bordered  delicate ferns  grasses among which lifted  creamy spikes   arrowhead  blue  waterhyacinth   delicate yellow   jewelflower as freckles leaned handling  feather  staring  it then into  depths   pool  once more gave voice  his old query “i wonder what  is” straight across  him couched   mosses   soggy old log  big green bullfrog  palpitant throat  batting eyes lifted his head  bellowed  answer “fin dout fin dout” “whawhats that” stammered freckles almost too much bewildered  speak “ii know you  only  bullfrog but  jabbers  sounded mightily like speech wouldnt you please   saying  over” the bullfrog cuddled contentedly   ooze then suddenly  lifted his voice and   imperative drumbeat rolled  again “fin dout fin dout fin dout” freckles had  answer something seemed  snap  his brain there   wavering flame before his eyes then his mind cleared his head lifted   new poise his shoulders squared while his spine straightened the agony  over his soul floated free freckles came into his birthright “before god i will” he uttered  oath so impressively   recording angel never winced   posted    prayer column freckles set his hat over  top  one   locust posts used between trees  hold up  wire while  fastened  feather securely   band then  started down  line talking  himself  men who have worked long alone always fall into  habit  doing “what  fool i have been”  muttered “of course thats what i have  do there wouldnt likely anybody  doing   me of course i can what

her beak  freckles burst into  laugh but clapped his hand over his mouth  stifle  sound the lover ducked  sidestepped  few feet he spread his wings  slowly  softly waved them precisely  if   fanning his charmer which  indeed  result  accomplished then  wave  uncontrollable tenderness moved him so  hobbled  his bombardment once more he faced her squarely this time  turned his head  side  side  queer little jerks  indiscriminate peckings  her wings  head  smirkings  really should have been irresistible she yawned  shuffled away indifferently freckles reached up pulled  quill  his hat

freckles lifted his hat  faced  sky the harvest moon looked down sheeting  swamp  silver glory the limberlost sang her night song the swale softly rustled   wind winged things  night brushed his face

entrance   shade  then take  horse toward  north   better place  knew then    entertain  angel  his study or   line until  bird woman finished her work  came  them “this  take only  little time” she said “i know where  set  camera now  little chicken  big enough   good  too small  run away or  act very ugly so i   coming soon  see about those nests i have ten plates along  i surely wont use more than two  him so perhaps i can get some nests or young birds this morning” freckles almost flew  his dream had come true so soon he  walking  timberline   angel  following him he asked   excused  going first because  wanted   sure  trail  safe  her she laughed  his fears telling him     polite thing  him  do anyway “oh” said freckles “so you  after knowing that well i didnt spose you did  i  afraid youd think me wanting  respect   preceding you” the astonished angel looked  him caught  irrepressible gleam  irish fun  his eyes so they stood  laughed together freckles did not realize how   talking  morning he showed her many   beautiful nests  eggs   line she could identify  number  them but  some she  ignorant so they made notes   number  color   eggs material  construction  nest color size  shape   birds  went  find them   book at his room when freckles had lifted  overhanging bushes  stepped back  her  enter his heart  all out  time  place the study  vastly more beautiful than  week previous the angel drew  deep breath  stood gazing first  one side then  another then far down  cathedral aisle “its just fairyland” she cried ecstatically then she turned  stared  freckles  she had  his handiwork “what  you planning  be” she asked wonderingly “whatever mr mclean wants me to”  replied “what do you do most” she asked “watch me lines” “i dont mean work” “oh  me spare time i keep me room  study  me books” “do you work   room or  books most” “on  room only what  takes  keep  up   rest   time  me books” the angel studied him closely “well maybe you  going    great scholar” she said “but you dont look it your face isnt right  that but its got something big  itsomething really great i must find out what    then you must work  it your father  expecting you  do something one can tell   way  talks you should begin right away youve wasted too much time already” poor freckles hung his head he never had wasted  hour  his life there never had been one   his  waste the angel studying him intently read  thought  his face “oh i dont mean that” she cried   frank dismay  sixteen “of course youre not lazy no one ever would think   your appearance its this i mean there  something fine strong  full  power  your face there  something you   do  this world  no matter how you work  all these other things or how successfully you do them   all wasted until you find  one thing  you can do best if you hadnt  thing   world  keep you  could go anywhere you please  do anything you want what would you do” persisted  angel “id go  chicago  sing   first episcopal choir” answered freckles promptly the angel dropped   seatthe hat she had removed  held  her fingers rolled  her feet “there” she exclaimed vehemently “you can see what im going  be nothing absolutely nothing you can sing of course you can sing it  written all over you” “anyone  half wit could have seen  could sing without having   told” she thought “its   slenderness  his fingers  his quick nervous touch it    brightness  his hair  fire  his eyes  breadth  his chest  muscles  his throat  neck  above all its  every tone  his voice  even   speak its  sweetest sound i ever heard   throat

business” said  angel “you go over there  stand before  hedge  sing something just anything you think  first” freckles faced  angel  his banked wall  brown blue  crimson   background  solid green  lifting his face   sky  sang  first thing  came into his mind it   childrens song   had led   little folks   home many times recalled  his mind   angels exclamation “to fairyland we go with  song  joy heigho in dreams well stand upon  shore and all  realm behold well see  sights so grand that belong  fairyland its mysteries we  explore its beauties  unfold “oh tra la la oh ha ha ha were happy now  we can be our welcome song we  prolong and greet you  our melody o fairyland sweet fairyland we love  sing” no song could have given  intense sweetness  rollicking quality  freckles voice better scope

entrance “freckles freckles” called  voice   bird woman they    trail   instant “both those revolvers loaded” she asked “yes” said freckles “is there  way you can cut across  swamp  reach  chicken tree   few minutes   little noise” “yes” “then go flying” said  bird woman “give  angel  lift behind me  we  ride  horse back where you left him  wait  you i finished little chicken  no time  put him back his mother came so close i felt sure she would enter  log the light  fine so i set  focused  camera  covered   branches attached  long hose  went away over  hundred feet  hid  some bushes  wait a

carriage  bird woman   angel had  horse hitched  outfit packed   calmly waiting the bird woman held  revolver  her hand she wore dark clothing they had pinned  big focusing cloth over  front   angels light dress “give angel one  your revolvers quick” said  bird woman “we  creep up until we   fair range the underbrush  so thick  they  so busy  they  never notice us if we dont make  noise you fire first then i  pop   my direction  then you angel  shoot quite high or else very low we mustnt really hit them well go close enough   cowards  make  interesting  keep  up until we have them going” freckles protested the bird woman reached over and taking  smaller revolver  his belt handed    angel “keep your nerve steady dear watch where you step  shoot high” she said “go straight  them  where you are wait until you hear freckles first shot then follow me  closely  you can  let them know  we outnumber them if you want  save mcleans wager  you now you go” she commanded freckles who   agonized glance   angel ran toward  east the bird woman chose  middle distance    last time cautioned  angel  she moved away  lie down  shoot high through  underbrush  bird woman crept even more closely than she had intended found  clear range  waited  freckles shot there  one long minute  sickening suspense the men straightened  breath work  difficult   handsaw   heat   swamp as they rested  big dark fellow took  bottle  his pocket  began oiling  saw “we got  keep mighty quiet”  said “and wait  fell  until  damned guard  gone  his dinner” again they bent  their work freckles revolver spat

bird woman  her shot scarcely could have been called high at almost  same instant  third shot whistled   east black jack sprang into  air   yell  complete panic   ripped  heel  his boot freckles emptied his second chamber   earth spattered over wessner shots poured  rapidly without even reaching   weapon both men ran toward  east road  great leaping bounds while leaden slugs sung  hissed around them  deadly earnest freckles  trimming his corners  closely   dared but if  angel did not really intend  hit she  taking risks   scandalous manner when  men reached  trail freckles yelled   top  his voice “head them off   south boys fire   south” as  had hoped jack  wessner instantly plunged into  swale a spattering  lead followed them they crossed  swale running low  not even one backward glance  entered  woods beyond  corduroy then  little party gathered   tree “id better fix this saw so they cant  using  if they come back” said freckles taking out his hatchet  making sawteeth fly “now we must leave here without being seen” said  bird woman   angel “it wont do  me  make enemies  these men  i am likely  meet them while  work any day” “you can do   driving straight north  this road” said freckles “i  go ahead  cut  wires  you the swale  almost dry you  only  sinking  little in  few rods you  strike  cornfield i  take down  fence  let you into that follow  furrows  drive straight across  until you come   other side be following  fence south until you come   road through  woods east  it then take  road  follow east until you reach  pike you  come out  your way back  town  two miles north  anywhere they  likely  be dont  your lives ever let  out  you did this”  earnestly cautioned “for its black enemies you would  making” freckles clipped  wires  they drove through the angel leaned   carriage  held out his revolver freckles looked  her  surprise her eyes  black while her face   deeper rose than usual he felt  his own  white “did i shoot high enough” she asked sweetly “i really forgot about lying down” freckles winced did  child know how close she had gone surely she could not or   possible  she had  nerve  skill  fire like  purposely “i  send  first reliable man i meet  mclean” said  bird woman gathering up  lines “if i dont meet one when we reach town we  send  messenger if  wasnt  having  gang see me i would go myself but i  promise you  you  have help   little over two hours you keep well hidden they must think some   gang   you now there isnt  chance  they   back but dont run any risks remain under cover if they should come

shouting themselves hoarse   limberlost guard freckles did not feel   deserved it he would have given much   able  go   men  explain but  mclean only could  tell his story at  sight  freckles  men threw up their hats  cheered mclean shook hands  him warmly but big duncan gathered him into his arms  hugged him   bear  choked over  few words  praise the gang drove   finished felling  tree mclean  angry beyond measure  this attempt  his property   their haste  fell  tree  thieves had cut too high  wasted  foot   half  valuable timber when  last wagon rolled away mclean sat   stump  freckles told  story   aching  tell the boss scarcely could believe his senses also   much disappointed “i have been almost praying all  way over freckles”  said “that you would have some evidence  which we could arrest those fellows  get them out  our way but this  never do we cant mix up those women  it they have helped you save me  tree  my wager  well going across  country  she does  bird woman never

angel “i know her father well” said mclean  last “and i have often seen her you  right she   beautiful young girl  she appears   utterly free   least particle  false pride or foolishness i do not understand why her father risks such  jewel  this place” “hes daring  because she   jewel sir” said freckles eagerly “why shes trusting  rattlesnake  rattle before  strikes her   course she thinks she can trust mankind  well the man isnt made who wouldnt lay down  life  him  her she doesnt need any care her face   pretty ways  her  all  protection she would need   band  howling savages” “did you say she handled one   revolvers” asked mclean “she scared all  breath out  me body” admitted freckles “seems  her father  taught her  shoot the bird woman told her distinctly  lie low  blaze away high just  help scare them the spunky little thing followed them right out into  west road spitting lead like hail  clipping all around  heads  heels  them  im damned sir if i believe shed cared  rap if

black jack will wessner may not have  pluck unless   half drunk then hed   terror and  next time” freckles hesitated “what” “it    question  who shoots first  straightest” “then  only thing  me  do

“next time  where i run i wont try  fight them alone ill just  getting wind  them  then make tracks  you ill need  come like lightning  duncan  no extra horse so im thinking youd best get me oneor perhaps  wheel would  better i used  do extra work   home doctor   would let me take his bicycle  ride around  place and  times  head nurse would loan me his   hour a wheel would cost less   faster than  horse  would take less care i believe if you  going  town soon you had best pick up any kind   old one  some secondhand store  if im ever called  use    hurry there wont   handlebars left after crossing  corduroy” “yes” said mclean “and if you didnt have  firstclass wheel you never could cross  corduroy    all” as they walked   cabin mclean insisted  another guard but freckles  stubbornly set  fighting his battle alone he made one mental condition if  bird woman  going  give up  little chicken series  would yield   second guard solely   sake  her work   presence   angel   limberlost he did not propose  have  second man unless   absolutely necessary   had been alone so long   loved  solitude his chickens  flowers the thought  having  stranger  all his ways come  meddle  his

trail  test it it  new chainless   little  possible  catch  hurried riding   every way  best   kind freckles went skimming around  trail     preliminary trip before  locked   his case  started his minute examination  his line  foot he glanced around his room   left it  then stood staring on  moss before his prettiest seat lay  angels hat in  excitement  yesterday all  them had forgotten it he went  picked  up oh so carefully gazing    hungry eyes but touching  only  carry   his case where  hung    shining handlebar   new wheel  locked  among his treasures then  went   trail   new expression  his face   strange throbbing  his heart he  not   least afraid  anything  morning he felt    veriest daniel but all his lions seemed weak  harmless what black jacks next move would   could not imagine but  there would   move  some kind  certain the big bully  not  man  give up his purpose or  have  hat swept  his head   bullet  bear  meekly moreover wessner would cling  his revenge   dutchmans singleness  mind freckles tried  think connectedly but there  too many places   trail where  angels footprints  vet visible she had stepped  one mucky spot  left  sharp impression the afternoon sun had baked  hard   horses hoofs had not obliterated any part  it  they had  so many places freckles stood fascinated gazing  it he measured  lovingly  his eye he would not have ventured  caress  her hat any more than  her person but this  different surely  footprint   trail might belong  anyone who found  wanted it he stooped under  wires  entered  swamp with  little searching  found  big piece  thick bark loose   log  carefully peeling it carried  out  covered  print so   first rain would not obliterate it when  reached his room  tenderly laid  hat upon his bookshelf   wear off his awkwardness mounted his wheel  went spinning  trail again it  like flying   path  worn smooth  his feet  baked hard   sun almost all  way when  came   bark  veered far  one side  smiled    passing suddenly   off  wheel kneeling beside it he removed his hat carefully lifted  bark  gazed lovingly   imprint “i wonder what she  going  say  me voice”  whispered “she never got  said but   face  her i

appearing  if  had been drinking   fountain  gladness chapter viii wherein freckles meets  man  affairs  loses nothing   encounter “weel i  drawed on” exclaimed mrs duncan freckles stood before her holding  angels hat “ive been thinking this long time  ye or duncan would see  sunbonnets werena braw enough   woman  my standing  yere  guid laddie  bring me this beautiful hat” she turned  around examining  weave   straw   foliage trimmings passing her rough fingers over  satin ties delightedly as she held  up admiring it freckles astonished eyes saw  new side  sarah duncan she  jesting but under  jest  fact loomed strong that though poor overworked   none but godgiven refinement there  something  her soul crying after  bit  feminine finery   made his heart ache  her he resolved  when

“its verra plain  simple but  juist makes ye feel  its all   finest stuff its exactly what id call  heavenly hat” “sure” said freckles “for its belonging   angel” then  told her about  hat  asked her what  should do  it “take   her  course” said sarah duncan “like its  only ane she   she may need  badly” freckles smiled he had  clear idea about  hat being  only one  angel had however there   thing  felt  should do  wanted  do but   not sure “you think i might  taking  home”  said “of course ye must” said mrs duncan “and without another hours delay its been here two days noo  she may want it

while   so hurried he exchanged his wadingboots  shoes gave her his club  went spinning toward town he knew very well where  angel lived he had seen her home many times   passed  again without even raising his eyes   street steering straight  her fathers place  business carrying  hat freckles passed  long line  clerks    door   private office asked  see  proprietor when  had waited  moment  tall spare keeneyed man faced him   brisk nervous tones asked “how can i serve you sir” freckles handed him  package  answered “by delivering  your daughter this hat which she  after leaving  me place

favoring me greatly if you would deliver  hat   message good morning sir”   turned away “one minute” said  angels father “suppose i give you permission  return this hat  person  make your own acknowledgments” freckles stood one moment thinking intently  then  lifted those eyes  unswerving truth  asked “why should you sir you  kind indade  mention it  its thanking you i am  your good intintions but my wanting  go or your being willing  have me aint proving  your daughter would  wanting me or care  bother  me” the angels father looked keenly into  face  this extraordinary young man   found   his liking “theres one other thing i meant  say” said freckles “every day i see something   times  lot  things  i think  bird woman would  wanting pictures  badly if she knew you might  speaking    her  if shed want me to i can send her word when i find things she wouldnt likely get elsewhere” “if thats  case” said  angels father “and you feel under obligations  her assistance  other

conceived  gentleman should be  surprised  man  affairs into thinking  him  seeing his face over his books many times  morning whereas if  had gone   angel   had longed  do her father never would have

 week out i shouldnt    least surprised  see her start any hour” freckles could not endure  suspense  had  come “and you”  questioned but  dared not lift his eyes “wild horses me too” she laughed “couldnt keep me away either i dearly love  come   next time i am going  bring my banjo  ill play  you sing  me some   songs i like best wont you” “yis” said freckles because   all   capable  saying

  stars  shining before  reached  home   bird woman from afar  could see   house  ablaze  lights the lawn  veranda  strung  fancy lanterns  alive  people he thought his errand important so  turn back never occurred  freckles this  all  time or opportunity  would have he must see  bird woman  see her  once he leaned his wheel inside  fence  walked up  broad front entrance as  neared  steps  saw   place  swarming  young people   angel   excuse   group  surrounded her came hurrying  him “oh freckles” she cried delightedly “so you could come we  so afraid you could not im  glad  i can be” “i dont

disturb  story but i want you  come  outside way   conservatory  have some  my birthday lunch  some cake  take  mrs duncan   babies wont   fun” freckles thought   would  more than fun  followed delightedly the angel gave him  big glass brimming  some icy sparkling liquid  struck his palate   never had been touched before because  combination  frosty fruit juices had not been  frequent beverage  him the night  warm   angel most beautiful  kind a triple delirium  spirit mind  body seized upon him  developed  boldness all unnatural he slightly parted  heavy curtains  separated  conservatory   company  looked between he almost stopped breathing he had read  things like that but  never had seen them the open space seemed  stretch through half  dozen rooms all ablaze  lights perfumed  flowers  filled  elegantly dressed people there  glimpses  polished floors sparkling glass  fine furnishings from somewhere  voice  his beloved bird woman arose  fell the angel crowded beside him   watching also “doesnt  look pretty” she whispered “do you suppose heaven  any finer than that” asked freckles the angel began  laugh “do you want   laughing harder than that” queried freckles “a laugh  always good” said  angel “a little more avoirdupois wont hurt me go ahead” “well then” said freckles “its only  i feel all over  if i belonged there i could wear fine clothes  move over those floors  hold me own against  best  them” “but where does my laugh come in” demanded  angel  if she had been defrauded “and you ask me where  laugh comes in looking me   face after that” marveled freckles “i wouldnt  so foolish   laugh  such  manifest truth  that” said  angel “anyone who knows you even half  well  i do knows  you  never guilty   discourtesy  you move  twice  grace  any man here why shouldnt you feel  if you belonged where people  graceful  courteous” “on me soul” said freckles “you  kind   thinking it you  doubly kind   saying it” the curtains parted   woman came toward them her silks  laces trailed across  polished floors the lights gleamed  her neck  arms  flashed  rare jewels she  smiling brightly  until she spoke freckles had not realized fully    his loved bird woman noticing his bewilderment she cried “why freckles dont you know me  my war clothes” “i do   uniform  which you fight  limberlost” said freckles the bird woman laughed then  told her why  had come but she scarcely could believe him she could not say exactly when she would go but she would make   soon  possible  she  most anxious   study while they talked  angel  busy packing  box  sandwiches cake fruit  flowers she gave him  last frosty glass thanked him repeatedly  bringing news  new material then freckles went into  night he rode toward  limberlost  his eyes   stars presently  removed his hat hung   his belt  ruffled his hair   sweep   night wind he filled  air all  way  snatches  oratorios gospel hymns  dialect  coon songs   startlingly varied programme the one thing

waiting they heard freckles before they saw him he came gliding down  line swiftly    rode   singing softly “oh do you love oh say you love” he got no farther the sharply driven wheel struck  tense wire  bounded back freckles shot over  handlebar  coasted down  trail  his chest as  struck black jack  wessner  upon him wessner caught off  old felt hat  clapped  over freckles mouth while black jack twisted  boys arms behind him  they rushed him into his room almost before  realized  anything had happened   trussed   tree  securely gagged then three   men resumed work   tree the other

report them it  not   hoped for the place always had been lawless it could mean but one thing a mist swept before his eyes while his head swam was  only last night   had worshiped  angel   delirium

and after they had conspired  make him appear  runaway thief  his loved ones what    wessner would do  him whatever  was freckles lifted his head  resolved   would bear  mind what  had once heard  bird woman say he would go out bonnily never would  let them see if  grew afraid after all what did  matter what they did  his body if  some scheme   devil they could encompass his disgrace then hope suddenly rose high  freckles breast they could not do that the angel would not believe neither would mclean he would keep up his courage kill him they could dishonor him they could not yet summon all  fortitude  might  saw eating into  tree rasped his nerves worse  worse with whirling brain  gazed into  limberlost searching  something  knew not what   blank horror found his eyes focusing   angel

words she said were “why have  gang come so soon i didnt know you expected them  three weeks yet or  this some especial tree  mr mclean needs  fill  order right now” freckles hesitated would  man dare lie  save himself no but  save  angelsurely   different he opened his lips but  angel  capable  saving herself she walked among them exactly  if she had been reared   lumber camp  never waited   answer “why your specimen case” she cried “look havent you noticed  its tipped over set  straight quickly” a couple   men stepped out  carefully righted  case “there thats better” she said “freckles

“well ill leave   you isnt  handsome” she challenged “as   cowboys face  couldnt  compared  yours the only trouble  you   your clothes  spoiling you its  dress those cowboys wear  makes half their attraction if you  properly clothed you could break  heart   prettiest girl   country” with one accord  other men looked  black jack    first time realized     superb specimen  manhood   stood six feet tall  broad wellrounded  had dark even skin big black eyes  full red lips “ill tell you what” exclaimed  angel “id just love  see you  horseback nothing sets  handsome man off so splendidly do

longer then wear  blue flannel shirt  little open   throat  red tie   broadbrimmed felt hat  ride past my house  evenings im always  home then  almost always   veranda and oh but i would like  see you

expression the evil lines    softening  fading under her clear gaze a dull red flamed into his bronze cheeks while his eyes  growing brightly tender “yes”  said   glance  gave  men   such  nature  no one saw fit even  change countenance “oh goody” she cried tilting  her toes “ill ask all  girls  come see but they neednt stick in we can get along without them cant we” jack leaned toward her he   charmed fluttering bird while  angel   snake “well i rather guess”  cried the angel drew  deep breath  surveyed him rapturously “my but youre tall” she commented “do you suppose i ever  grow  reach your shoulders” she stood  tiptoe  measured  distance  her eyes then she developed timid confusion while her glance sought  ground “i wish i could do something” she half whispered jack seemed  increase  inch  height “what”  asked hoarsely “lariat bill used always  have  bunch  red flowers  his shirt pocket the red lit up his dark eyes  olive cheeks  made him splendid may i put some red flowers  you” freckles stared   wheezed  breath he wished  earth would open  swallow him was  dead or alive since his angel had seen black jack she never had glanced his way was she completely bewitched would she throw herself   mans feet before them all couldnt she give him even one thought hadnt she seen    gagged  bound did she truly think  these  mcleans men why she could not it  only  few days ago  she had been close enough  this man  angry enough  him  peel  hat  his head   shot suddenly  thing she had said jestingly  him one day came back  startling force “you must take angels  trust” of course you must she  his angel she must have seen his life  what  far more her own   her hands there  nothing  could do but trust her surely she  working out some plan the angel knelt beside his flower bed  recklessly tore up   roots  big bunch  foxfire “these stems  so tough  sticky” she said “i cant break them loan me your knife” she ordered freckles as she reached   knife her back   one second toward  men she looked into his eyes  deliberately winked she severed  stems tossed  knife  freckles  walking  jack laid  flowers over his heart freckles broke into  sweat  agony he had said she would  safe   herd  howling savages would she if black jack even made  motion toward touching her freckles knew   somewhere  would muster  strength  kill him he mentally measured  distance  where his club lay  set his muscles   spring but noby  splendor  god the big fellow  baring his head   hand   unsteady the angel pulled one   long silver pins  her hat  fastened her flowers securely freckles  quaking what   come next what  she planning  oh did she understand  danger  her presence among those men  real necessity  action as  angel stepped  jack she turned her head  one side  peered  him quite  freckles had seen  little yellow fellow do   line  hundred times  said “well  does  trick isnt  fine see how  sets him off boys dont you forget  tie    red   first ride soon i cant wait very long now i must go the bird woman   ready  start  she  come here hunting me next  she  busy today what did i come here  anyway” she glanced inquiringly around  several   men laughed oh  delight  it she had forgotten her errand  him jack had  second increase  height the angel glanced helplessly  if seeking  clue then her eyes fell  if  accident  freckles  she cried “oh i know now it  those magazines  bird woman promised you i came  tell you  we put them under  box where we hide things   entrance   swamp  we came in i knew i would need my hands crossing  swamp so i hid them there youll find them   same old place” then freckles spoke “its mighty risky  you   crossing  swamp alone”  said “im surprised   bird woman would  letting you try it i know its  little farther but its begging you i am   going back   trail thats bad enough but its far safer than  swamp” the angel laughed merrily “oh stop your nonsense” she cried “im not afraid not   least the bird woman didnt want me  try following  path  id been over only once but i  sure i could do it  im rather proud   performance now dont go babying you know im not afraid” “no” said freckles gently “i know youre not but   nothing  do   fact  your friends  afraid  you on  trail you can see your way  bit ahead  youve all  world  better chance if you meet  snake” then freckles had  inspiration he turned  jack imploringly “you tell her”  pleaded “tell her  go   trail she   you” the implication  this statement  so gratifying  black jack   seemed again  expand  take  increase before their very eyes “you bet” exclaimed jack and   angel “you better take freckles word  it miss he knows  old swamp better than any  us except me  if  says go   trail youd best do it” the angel hesitated she wanted  recross  swamp  try  reach  horse she knew freckles would brave any danger  save her crossing  swamp alone but she really  not afraid while  trail added over  mile   walk she knew  path she intended  run  dear life  instant she felt herself  their sight  tucked   folds  her blouse   fine little caliber revolver  her father had presented her  her share  what   pleased  call her military exploit one last glance  freckles showed her  agony  his eyes  immediately she imagined  had some other reason she would follow  trail “all right” she said giving jack  thrilling glance “if you say so ill return   trail  please you goodbye everybody” she lifted  bushes  started toward  entrance “you damned fool stop her” growled wessner “keep her till were loaded anyhow youre playing hell cant you see  when this thing  found out there shell   ruin all  us if you let her go every man  us  got  cut  some  us   caught sure” jack sprang forward freckles heart muffled  his throat the angel seemed  divine jacks coming she  humming  little song she deliberately stopped  began pulling  heads   curious grasses  grew all around her when she straightened she took  step backward  called “ho freckles  bird woman wants  natural history pamphlet returned it belongs   set she  going  have bound thats one   reasons we put  under  box you  sure  get them  you go home tonight  fear  rains or becomes damp   heavy dews” “all right” said freckles but     voice   never had heard before then  angel turned  sent  parting glance  jack she  overpoweringly human  bewitchingly lovely “you wont forget  ride   red tie” she half asserted half questioned jack succumbed freckles  his captive but    angels soul  body his face wore  holiest look  ever had known   softly reechoed freckles “all right” with her head held well up  angel walked slowly away  jack turned   men “drop your damned staring  saw wood”  shouted “dont you know anything  all about how  treat  lady” it might have been  question which   cronies  crouched over green wood fires   cabins  wildcat hollow eternally sucking  corncob pipe  stirring  endless kettles  stewing coon  opossum had taught him  do even  well   had   angel the men muttered  threatened among themselves but they began working desperately someone suggested   man  sent  follow  angel   watch her   bird woman leave  swamp freckles heart sank within him but jack    delirium  past all caution “yes”  sneered “mebby all  you had better give over   saw  run after  girl i guess not seems  me i got  favors i didnt see no bouquets   rest  you if anybody follows her i do  im needed here among

difference about  noise” answered jack “she took us    mcleans gang slick  grease make  chips fly” so all  them attacked  big tree freckles sat  one  his benches  waited in their haste  fell  tree  load it so   teamsters could start  leave them free  attack another they had forgotten  rebind him the angel    trail  safely started the cold perspiration made freckles temples clammy  ran  little streams down his chest it would take her more time  follow  trail but her safety  freckles sole thought  urging her  go  way he tried  figure  how long  would require  walk   carriage he wondered if

my boy by heaven shes sense courage  beauty  half  dozen girls” said mclean “its altogether right you are sir” affirmed freckles heartily presently  added “theres no question but  series  over now” “dont think it” answered mclean “the bird woman  working  success  success along any line  not won  being scared out she   back   usual day  ten  one  angel    her they  made  pretty stern stuff  they

resolutely wiping her eyes   palm  her hand  gulping down  nervous spasm  her throat “i must read this paper before i meet lord omore” she blinked back  tears  spreading  paper  her knee read “after

lord omores card “has my uncle started yet” she asked sweetly the surprised clerk stepped back   bellboy  covertly kicked him  being   way “his lordship   his room”  said   low bow “all right” said  angel picking up  card “i thought  might have started ill see him” the clerk shoved  bellboy toward  angel “show her ladyship   elevator  lord omores suite”  said bowing double “aw thanks” said  angel   slight nod  she turned away “im not sure” she muttered  herself   elevator sped upward “whether its  irish or  english who say aw thanks but its probable  isnt either  anyway i just had  do something  counteract  all right how stupid  me” at  bellboys tap  door swung open   liveried servant thrust  cardtray before  angel the opening   door created  current  swayed  curtain aside    adjoining room lounging   big chair   paper  his hand sat  man who was beyond question  freckles blood  race with perfect control  angel dropped lord omores card   tray stepped past his servant  stood before his lordship “good morning” she said  tense politeness lord omore said nothing he carelessly glanced her over  amused curiosity until her color began  deepen  her blood  run hotly “well my dear”  said  last “how can i serve you” instantly  angel became indignant she had been so shielded   midst  almost entire freedom owing   circumstances  her life   words   look appeared  her  almost insulting she lifted her head   proud gesture “i am not your dear” she said  slow distinctness “there isnt  thing   world you can do  me i came here  see if i could do somethinga very great somethingfor you but if i dont like you i wont do it” then lord omore did stare suddenly  broke into  ringing laugh without  change  attitude or expression  angel stood looking steadily  him there   silken rustle then  beautiful woman  cheeks  satiny pink dark hair  eyes  pure irish blue moved  lord omores side  catching his arm shook him impatiently “terence have you lost your senses” she cried “didnt you understand what  child said look  her face see what she has” lord omore opened his eyes widely  sat up he did look   angels face intently  suddenly found  so good    difficult  follow  next injunction he arose instantly “i beg your pardon”  said “the fact is i am leaving chicago sorely disappointed it makes me bitter  reckless i thought you one more  those queer useless people who have thrust themselves  me constantly  i  careless forgive me  tell me why you came” “i  if i like you” said  angel stoutly “and if i dont i wont” “but i began all wrong  now i dont know how  make you like me” said his lordship  sincere penitence  his tone the angel found herself yielding  his voice he spoke   soft mellow smoothly flowing irish tone  although his speech  perfectly correct   so rounded  accented   sentences so turned    freckles over again still    matter   very greatest importance  she must  sure so she looked into  beautiful womans face “are you his wife” she asked “yes” said  woman “i am his wife” “well” said  angel judicially “the bird woman says no one   whole world knows all  mans bignesses  all his littlenesses  his wife does what you think  him should do  me do you like him” the question  so earnestly asked   met  equal earnestness the dark head moved caressingly against lord omores sleeve “better than anyone   whole world” said lady omore promptly the angel mused  second  then her legal tinge came   fore again “yes but have you anyone you could like better if  wasnt all right” she persisted “i have three  his sons two little daughters  father mother  several brothers  sisters” came  quick reply “and you like him best” persisted  angel  finality “i love him so much  i would give up every one  them  dry eyes if  so doing i could save him” cried lord omores wife “oh” cried  angel “oh my” she lifted her clear eyes  lord omores  shook her head “she never never could do that” she said “but its  mighty big thing  your credit  she thinks she could i guess ill tell you why i came” she laid down  paper  touched  portrait “when you  only  boy did people call you freckles” she asked “dozens  good fellows all over ireland   continent  doing  today” answered lord omore the angels face wore her most beautiful smile “i  sure  it” she said winningly “thats what we call him    so like you i doubt if any one  those three boys  yours  more so but its been twenty years seems  me youve been  long time coming” lord omore caught  angels wrists  his wife slipped her arms around her “steady my girl” said  mans voice hoarsely “dont make me think youve brought word   boy  this last hour unless you know surely” “its all right” said  angel “we have him  theres no chance   mistake if i hadnt gone   home  his little clothes  heard  you  been hunting you  had met you   street or anywhere i would have stopped you  asked you who you were just because you  so like him its all right i can tell you where freckles is but whether you deserve  knowthats another matter” lord omore did not hear her he dropped  his chair  covering his face burst into those terrible sobs  shake  rend  strong man lady omore hovered over him weeping “umph looks pretty fair

bundle  yellow  brown linen  gave only  glance   texture  work then she gathered  little clothes   picture  her heart  led  way   cab ushering lord  lady omore into  reception room she said  mclean “please go call up my father  ask him  come   first train” she closed  door after him “these  freckles people” she said   bird woman “you can find out about each other im going  him” chapter xix

quietly “why dont you look  me when you  telling about  lost boy” “ii didnt know i wasnt” faltered  angel “it seems  me” said freckles his breath beginning  come  sharp wheezes “that you got us rather

barely breathing  her fear still freckles lay rigid  whiter than  coverlet “would  boy   old  me”  asked “yes” said  angel faintly “angel” said freckles  last catching her wrist “are you trying  tell me  there  somebody hunting  boy  youre thinking might  me are you belavin youve found me relations” then  angels eyes came home the time had come she pinioned freckles arms  his sides  bent above him “how strong  you dear heart” she breathed “how brave  you can you bear it dare i tell you that” “no” gasped freckles “not if youre sure i cant bear it ill die if you do” the day had been one unremitting strain   angel nerve tension  drawn   finest thread it snapped suddenly “die” she flamed “die if i tell you that you said this morning  you would die if you didnt know your name  if your

terrified angel caught him  her arms  tried  stifle  sound she implored  commanded when   too worn  utter another sound his eyes laughed silently after  long time when   quiet  rested  angel commenced talking  him gently  this time her big eyes humid  tenderness  mellow  happiness seemed  if they could not leave his face “dear freckles” she  saying “across your knees there   face   mother who went into  fire  you  i know  nameold  full  honorto which you  born dear heart which  you have first” freckles  very tired  big drops  perspiration ran together  his temples but  watching angel caught  words his lips formed “me mother” she lifted  lovely pictured face  set    nook  his arm freckles caught her hand  drew her beside him  together they gazed   picture while  tears slid over their cheeks “me mother oh me mother can you ever  forgiving me oh me beautiful little mother” chanted freckles over  over  exalted wonder until   so completely exhausted  his lips refused  form  question  his weary eyes “wait” cried  angel  inborn refinement  she could no more answer  question than  could ask “wait i  write it” she hurried   table caught up  nurses pencil    back   prescription tablet scrawled it “terence maxwell omore dunderry house county clare ireland” before she had finished came freckles voice “angel  you hurrying” “yes” said  angel “i am but there   good deal  it i have  put

fingers over  slip  straightened his hair “now you  all right dear limberlost guard” she said “you go  sleep  dont think   thing but just pure joy joy joy ill keep your people until you wake up you  too tired  see anyone else just now” freckles caught her skirt  she turned  him “ill go  sleep  five minutes”  said “if you   doing just one thing more  me send  your father oh angel send  him quick how  i ever  waiting until  comes” one instant  angel stood looking  him the next  crimson wave darkly stained her lovely face her chin began  spasmodic quivering   tears sprang into her eyes her hands caught  her chest  if she  stifling freckles grasp  her tightened until  drew her beside him he slipped his arm around her  drew her face  his pillow “dont angel   love  mercy dont  doing that”  implored “i cant  bearing it tell me you must tell me” the angel shook her head “that aint fair angel” said freckles “you made me tell you when   like tearing  heart raw  me breast and you   making

bosss black hair  his cheek “dear boss thats why ive wanted you so i knew you would know now you   looking  these i dont want emeralds because thats what she gave me” he pushed  green stones into  little heap  rejected ones then  singled out all  pearls “aint they pretty things”  said “ill  getting her some  those later they  like lily faces turtlehead flowers dewdrops   shade or moonlight but they havent  life  them  i want   stone i give   angel right now” freckles heaped  pearls   emeralds he studied  diamonds  long time “these things  so fascinating like they almost tempt one though

reason good enough  keep me  it its  thing ive had  me mind every hour since ive had time  straighten things out  little may i  asking you  question” mclean reached over  took freckles hand his voice  shaken  feeling   replied “freckles you almost hurt me will you never learn how much you   mehow happy you make me  coming  me  anything no matter what” “then its this” said freckles gripping  hand  mclean strongly “if this accident  all thats come  me since had never happened where   you had planned  send me  school what   you meant  me  do” “why freckles” answered mclean “im scarcely prepared
