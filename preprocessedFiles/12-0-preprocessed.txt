it chapter i lookingglass house one thing  certain   white kitten had had nothing  do  it—it   black kitten’s fault entirely for  white kitten had been having  face washed   old cat   last quarter   hour and bearing  pretty well considering so you see   couldn’t have had any hand   mischief the way dinah washed her children’s faces  this first she held  poor thing down   ear  one paw  then   other paw she rubbed  face all over  wrong way beginning   nose  just now  i said she  hard  work   white kitten which  lying quite still  trying  purr—no doubt feeling    all meant   good but  black kitten had been finished  earlier   afternoon  so while alice  sitting curled up   corner   great armchair half talking  herself  half asleep  kitten had been having  grand game  romps   ball  worsted alice had been trying  wind up  had been rolling  up  down till  had all come undone again  there  was spread over  hearthrug all knots  tangles   kitten running after  own tail   middle “oh you wicked little thing” cried alice catching up  kitten  giving   little kiss  make  understand     disgrace “really dinah ought  have taught you better manners you ought dinah you know you ought” she added looking reproachfully   old cat  speaking   cross  voice  she could manage—and then she scrambled back into  armchair taking  kitten   worsted  her  began winding up  ball again but she didn’t get  very fast  she  talking all  time sometimes   kitten  sometimes  herself kitty sat very demurely  her knee pretending  watch  progress   winding  now  then putting out one paw  gently touching  ball  if  would  glad  help if  might “do you know what tomorrow is kitty” alice began “you’d have guessed if you’d been up   window  me—only dinah  making you tidy so you couldn’t i  watching  boys getting  sticks   bonfire—and  wants plenty  sticks kitty only  got so cold   snowed so they had  leave off never mind kitty we’ll go  see  bonfire tomorrow” here alice wound two or three turns   worsted round  kitten’s neck just  see how  would look this led   scramble  which  ball rolled down upon  floor  yards  yards   got unwound again “do you know i  so angry kitty” alice went   soon  they  comfortably settled again “when i saw all  mischief you had been doing i  very nearly opening  window  putting you out into  snow and you’d have deserved it you little mischievous darling what have you got  say  yourself now don’t interrupt me” she went on holding up one finger “i’m going  tell you all your faults number one you squeaked twice while dinah  washing your face this morning now you can’t deny it kitty i heard you what’s  you say” pretending   kitten  speaking “her paw went into your eye well that’s your fault  keeping your eyes open—if you’d shut them tight up  wouldn’t have happened now don’t make any more excuses but listen number two you pulled snowdrop away   tail just  i had put down  saucer  milk before her what you  thirsty  you how do you know she wasn’t thirsty too now  number three you unwound every bit   worsted while i wasn’t looking “that’s three faults kitty  you’ve not been punished  any  them yet you know i’m saving up all your punishments  wednesday week—suppose they had saved up all my punishments” she went on talking more  herself than  kitten “what would they do   end   year i should  sent  prison i suppose when  day came or—let me see—suppose each punishment    going without  dinner then when  miserable day came i should have  go without fifty dinners  once well i shouldn’t mind that much i’d far rather go without them than eat them “do you hear  snow against  windowpanes kitty how nice  soft  sounds just  if some one  kissing  window all over outside i wonder if  snow loves  trees  fields   kisses them so gently and then  covers them up snug you know   white quilt  perhaps  says ‘go  sleep darlings till  summer comes again’ and when they wake up   summer kitty they dress themselves all  green  dance about—whenever  wind blows—oh that’s very pretty” cried alice dropping  ball  worsted  clap her hands “and i do so wish   true i’m sure  woods look sleepy   autumn when  leaves  getting brown “kitty can you play chess now don’t smile my dear i’m asking  seriously because when we  playing just now you watched just  if you understood it  when i said ‘check’ you purred well  was  nice check kitty  really i might have won if  hadn’t been   nasty knight  came wiggling down among my pieces kitty dear let’s pretend—” and here i wish i could tell you half  things alice used  say beginning  her favourite phrase “let’s pretend” she had had quite  long argument  her sister only  day before—all because alice had begun  “let’s pretend we’re kings  queens”  her sister who liked being very exact had argued  they couldn’t because there  only two  them  alice had been reduced  last  say “well you can  one  them then  i’ll  all  rest” and once she had really frightened her old nurse  shouting suddenly  her ear “nurse do let’s pretend  i’m  hungry hyaena  you’re  bone” but this  taking us away  alice’s speech   kitten “let’s pretend  you’re  red queen kitty do you know i think if you sat up  folded your arms you’d look exactly like her now do try there’s  dear” and alice got  red queen off  table  set  up before  kitten   model    imitate however  thing didn’t succeed principally alice said because  kitten wouldn’t fold  arms properly so  punish it she held  up   lookingglass   might see how sulky  was—“and if you’re not good directly” she added “i’ll put you through into lookingglass house how would you like that” “now if you’ll only attend kitty  not talk so much i’ll tell you all my ideas about lookingglass house first there’s  room you can see through  glass—that’s just  same  our drawing room only  things go  other way i can see all   when i get upon  chair—all but  bit behind  fireplace oh i do so wish i could see that bit i want so much  know whether they’ve  fire   winter you never can tell you know unless our fire smokes  then smoke comes up   room too—but  may  only pretence just  make  look  if they had  fire well then  books  something like our books only  words go  wrong way i know that because i’ve held up one  our books   glass  then they hold up one   other room “how would you like  live  lookingglass house kitty i wonder if they’d give you milk  there perhaps lookingglass milk isn’t good  drink—but oh kitty now we come   passage you can just see  little peep   passage  lookingglass house if you leave  door  our drawingroom wide open  it’s very like our passage  far  you can see only you know  may  quite different  beyond oh kitty how nice  would  if we could only get through into lookingglass house i’m sure it’s got oh such beautiful things  it let’s pretend there’s  way  getting through into it somehow kitty let’s pretend  glass  got all soft like gauze so  we can get through why it’s turning into  sort  mist now i declare it’ll  easy enough  get through—” she  up   chimneypiece while she said this though she hardly knew how she had got there and certainly  glass was beginning  melt away just like  bright silvery mist in another moment alice  through  glass  had jumped lightly down into  lookingglass room the very first thing she did   look whether there   fire   fireplace  she  quite pleased  find  there   real one blazing away  brightly   one she had left behind “so i shall   warm here  i    old room” thought alice “warmer  fact because there’ll  no one here  scold me away   fire oh what fun it’ll be when they see me through  glass  here  can’t get  me” then she began looking about  noticed  what could  seen   old room  quite common  uninteresting but  all  rest   different  possible for instance  pictures   wall next  fire seemed   all alive   very clock   chimneypiece you know you can only see  back     lookingglass had got  face   little old man  grinned  her “they don’t keep this room so tidy   other” alice thought  herself  she noticed several   chessmen down   hearth among  cinders but  another moment   little “oh”  surprise she  down  her hands  knees watching them the chessmen  walking about two  two “here   red king   red queen” alice said in  whisper  fear  frightening them “and there   white king   white queen sitting   edge   shovel—and here  two castles walking arm  arm—i don’t think they can hear me” she went on  she put her head closer down “and i’m nearly sure they can’t see me i feel somehow  if i  invisible—” here something began squeaking   table behind alice  made her turn her head just  time  see one   white pawns roll over  begin kicking she watched   great curiosity  see what would happen next “it   voice  my child”  white queen cried out  she rushed past  king so violently  she knocked him over among  cinders “my precious lily my imperial kitten”  she began scrambling wildly up  side   fender “imperial fiddlestick” said  king rubbing his nose which had been hurt   fall he had  right    little annoyed   queen    covered  ashes  head  foot alice  very anxious    use and   poor little lily  nearly screaming herself into  fit she hastily picked up  queen  set her   table   side  her noisy little daughter the queen gasped  sat down  rapid journey through  air had quite taken away her breath    minute or two she could do nothing but hug  little lily  silence as soon  she had recovered her breath  little she called out   white king who  sitting sulkily among  ashes “mind  volcano” “what volcano” said  king looking up anxiously into  fire  if  thought    most likely place  find one “blew—me—up” panted  queen who  still  little out  breath “mind you come up—the regular way—don’t get blown up” alice watched  white king   slowly struggled up  bar  bar till  last she said “why you’ll  hours  hours getting   table   rate i’d far better help you hadn’t i” but  king took no notice   question   quite clear   could neither hear her nor see her so alice picked him up very gently  lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted  queen  she mightn’t take his breath away but before she put him   table she thought she might  well dust him  little   so covered  ashes she said afterwards  she had never seen  all her life such  face   king made when  found himself held   air   invisible hand  being dusted   far too much astonished  cry out but his eyes  his mouth went  getting larger  larger  rounder  rounder till her hand shook so  laughing  she nearly let him drop upon  floor “oh please don’t make such faces my dear” she cried out quite forgetting   king couldn’t hear her “you make me laugh so  i can hardly hold you and don’t keep your mouth so wide open all  ashes  get into it—there now i think you’re tidy enough” she added  she smoothed his hair  set him upon  table near  queen the king immediately fell flat  his back  lay perfectly still  alice   little alarmed  what she had done  went round  room  see if she could find any water  throw over him however she could find nothing but  bottle  ink  when she got back   she found  had recovered     queen  talking together   frightened whisper—so low  alice could hardly hear what they said the king  saying “i assure you my dear i turned cold   very ends  my whiskers” to which  queen replied “you haven’t got any whiskers” “the horror   moment”  king went on “i shall never never forget” “you will though”  queen said “if you don’t make  memorandum  it” alice looked   great interest   king took  enormous memorandumbook out  his pocket  began writing a sudden thought struck her  she took hold   end   pencil which came some way over his shoulder  began writing  him the poor king looked puzzled  unhappy  struggled   pencil  some time without saying anything but alice  too strong  him   last  panted out “my dear i really must get  thinner pencil i can’t manage this one  bit  writes all manner  things  i don’t intend—” “what manner  things” said  queen looking over  book in which alice had put “the white knight  sliding down  poker he balances very badly” “that’s not  memorandum  your feelings” there   book lying near alice   table  while she sat watching  white king for she  still  little anxious about him  had  ink all ready  throw over him  case  fainted again she turned over  leaves  find some part  she could read “—for it’s all  some language i don’t know” she said  herself it  like this ykcowrebbaj sevot yhtils eht dna gillirb sawt’ ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg did sevogorob eht erew ysmim lla ebargtuo shtar emom eht dna she puzzled over this  some time but  last  bright thought struck her “why it’s  lookingglass book  course and if i hold  up   glass  words  all go  right way again” this   poem  alice read jabberwocky ’twas brillig   slithy toves did gyre  gimble   wabe all mimsy   borogoves and  mome raths outgrabe “beware  jabberwock my son the jaws  bite  claws  catch beware  jubjub bird  shun the frumious bandersnatch” he took his vorpal sword  hand long time  manxome foe  sought— so rested    tumtum tree and stood awhile  thought and   uffish thought  stood the jabberwock  eyes  flame came whiffling through  tulgey wood and burbled   came one two one two and through  through the vorpal blade went snickersnack he left  dead    head he went galumphing back “and hast thou slain  jabberwock come  my arms my beamish boy o frabjous day callooh callay” he chortled  his joy ’twas brillig   slithy toves did gyre  gimble   wabe all mimsy   borogoves and  mome raths outgrabe “it seems very pretty” she said when she had finished it “but it’s rather hard  understand” you see she didn’t like  confess even  herself  she couldn’t make  out  all “somehow  seems  fill my head  ideas—only i don’t exactly know what they are however somebody killed something that’s clear  any rate—” “but oh” thought alice suddenly jumping up “if i don’t make haste i shall have  go back through  lookingglass before i’ve seen what  rest   house  like let’s have  look   garden first” she  out   room   moment  ran down stairs—or  least  wasn’t exactly running but  new invention  hers  getting down stairs quickly  easily  alice said  herself she just kept  tips  her fingers   handrail  floated gently down without even touching  stairs  her feet then she floated  through  hall  would have gone straight out   door   same way if she hadn’t caught hold   doorpost she  getting  little giddy  so much floating   air   rather glad  find herself walking again   natural way chapter ii the garden  live flowers “i should see  garden far better” said alice  herself “if i could get   top   hill  here’s  path  leads straight  it—at least no  doesn’t do that—” after going  few yards along  path  turning several sharp corners “but i suppose    last but how curiously  twists it’s more like  corkscrew than  path well this turn goes   hill i suppose—no  doesn’t this goes straight back   house well then i’ll try   other way” and so she did wandering up  down  trying turn after turn but always coming back   house do what she would indeed once when she turned  corner rather more quickly than usual she ran against  before she could stop herself “it’s no use talking about it” alice said looking up   house  pretending   arguing  her “i’m not going  again yet i know i should have  get through  lookingglass again—back into  old room—and there’d   end  all my adventures” so resolutely turning her back upon  house she set out once more down  path determined  keep straight  till she got   hill for  few minutes all went  well  she  just saying “i really shall do  this time—” when  path gave  sudden twist  shook itself as she described  afterwards   next moment she found herself actually walking    door “oh it’s too bad” she cried “i never saw such  house  getting   way never” however there   hill full  sight so there  nothing   done but start again this time she came upon  large flowerbed   border  daisies   willowtree growing   middle “o tigerlily” said alice addressing herself  one   waving gracefully about   wind “i wish you could talk” “we can talk” said  tigerlily “when there’s anybody worth talking to” alice  so astonished  she could not speak   minute  quite seemed  take her breath away at length   tigerlily only went  waving about she spoke again   timid voice—almost   whisper “and can all  flowers talk” “as well  you can” said  tigerlily “and  great deal louder” “it isn’t manners  us  begin you know” said  rose “and i really  wondering when you’d speak said i  myself ‘her face  got some sense  it though it’s not  clever one’ still you’re  right colour   goes  long way” “i don’t care about  colour”  tigerlily remarked “if only her petals curled up  little more she’d  all right” alice didn’t like being criticised so she began asking questions “aren’t you sometimes frightened  being planted out here  nobody  take care  you” “there’s  tree   middle” said  rose “what else   good for” “but what could  do if any danger came” alice asked “it says ‘boughwough’” cried  daisy “that’s why  branches  called boughs” “didn’t you know that” cried another daisy  here they all began shouting together till  air seemed quite full  little shrill voices “silence every one  you” cried  tigerlily waving itself passionately  side  side  trembling  excitement “they know i can’t get  them”  panted bending  quivering head towards alice “or they wouldn’t dare  do it” “never mind” alice said   soothing tone  stooping down   daisies who  just beginning again she whispered “if you don’t hold your tongues i’ll pick you” there  silence   moment  several   pink daisies turned white “that’s right” said  tigerlily “the daisies  worst  all when one speaks they all begin together  it’s enough  make one wither  hear  way they go on” “how   you can all talk so nicely” alice said hoping  get  into  better temper   compliment “i’ve been  many gardens before but none   flowers could talk” “put your hand down  feel  ground” said  tigerlily “then you’ll know why” alice did so “it’s very hard” she said “but i don’t see what    do  it” “in most gardens”  tigerlily said “they make  beds too soft—so   flowers  always asleep” this sounded  very good reason  alice  quite pleased  know it “i never thought   before” she said “it’s my opinion  you never think at all”  rose said   rather severe tone “i never saw anybody  looked stupider”  violet said so suddenly  alice quite jumped   hadn’t spoken before “hold your tongue” cried  tigerlily “as if you ever saw anybody you keep your head under  leaves  snore away there till you know no more what’s going    world than if you   bud” “are there any more people   garden besides me” alice said not choosing  notice  rose’s last remark “there’s one other flower   garden  can move about like you” said  rose “i wonder how you do it—” “you’re always wondering” said  tigerlily “but she’s more bushy than you are” “is she like me” alice asked eagerly   thought crossed her mind “there’s another little girl   garden somewhere” “well she   same awkward shape  you”  rose said “but she’s redder—and her petals  shorter i think” “her petals  done up close almost like  dahlia”  tigerlily interrupted “not tumbled about anyhow like yours” “but that’s not your fault”  rose added kindly “you’re beginning  fade you know—and then one can’t help one’s petals getting  little untidy” alice didn’t like this idea  all so  change  subject she asked “does she ever come out here” “i daresay you’ll see her soon” said  rose “she’s one   thorny kind” “where does she wear  thorns” alice asked  some curiosity “why all round her head  course”  rose replied “i  wondering you hadn’t got some too i thought    regular rule” “she’s coming” cried  larkspur “i hear her footstep thump thump thump along  gravelwalk” alice looked round eagerly  found     red queen “she’s grown  good deal”  her first remark she had indeed when alice first found her   ashes she had been only three inches high—and here she was half  head taller than alice herself “it’s  fresh air  does it” said  rose “wonderfully fine air  is out here” “i think i’ll go  meet her” said alice for though  flowers  interesting enough she felt   would  far grander  have  talk   real queen “you can’t possibly do that” said  rose “i should advise you  walk  other way” this sounded nonsense  alice so she said nothing but set off  once towards  red queen to her surprise she lost sight  her   moment  found herself walking    frontdoor again a little provoked she drew back  after looking everywhere   queen whom she spied out  last  long way off she thought she would try  plan this time  walking   opposite direction it succeeded beautifully she had not been walking  minute before she found herself face  face   red queen  full  sight   hill she had been so long aiming at “where do you come from” said  red queen “and where  you going look up speak nicely  don’t twiddle your fingers all  time” alice attended  all these directions  explained  well  she could  she had lost her way “i don’t know what you mean  your way” said  queen “all  ways about here belong  me—but why did you come out here  all” she added   kinder tone “curtsey while you’re thinking what  say  saves time” alice wondered  little  this but she  too much  awe   queen  disbelieve it “i’ll try  when i go home” she thought  herself “the next time i’m  little late  dinner” “it’s time  you  answer now”  queen said looking  her watch “open your mouth  little wider when you speak  always say ‘your majesty’” “i only wanted  see what  garden  like your majesty—” “that’s right” said  queen patting her   head which alice didn’t like  all “though when you say ‘garden’—i’ve seen gardens compared  which this would   wilderness” alice didn’t dare  argue  point but went on “—and i thought i’d try  find my way   top   hill—” “when you say ‘hill’”  queen interrupted “i could show you hills  comparison  which you’d call   valley” “no i shouldn’t” said alice surprised into contradicting her  last “a hill can’t   valley you know that would  nonsense—” the red queen shook her head “you may call  ‘nonsense’ if you like” she said “but i’ve heard nonsense compared  which  would   sensible   dictionary” alice curtseyed again  she  afraid   queen’s tone  she   little offended  they walked   silence till they got   top   little hill for some minutes alice stood without speaking looking out  all directions over  country—and  most curious country  was there   number  tiny little brooks running straight across   side  side   ground between  divided up into squares   number  little green hedges  reached  brook  brook “i declare it’s marked out just like  large chessboard” alice said  last “there ought   some men moving about somewhere—and so there are” she added   tone  delight  her heart began  beat quick  excitement  she went on “it’s  great huge game  chess that’s being played—all over  world—if this is  world  all you know oh what fun  is how i wish i  one  them i wouldn’t mind being  pawn if only i might join—though  course i should like    queen best” she glanced rather shyly   real queen  she said this but her companion only smiled pleasantly  said “that’s easily managed you can   white queen’s pawn if you like  lily’s too young  play  you’re   second square  begin with when you get   eighth square you’ll   queen—” just  this moment somehow or other they began  run alice never could quite make out  thinking  over afterwards how    they began all she remembers is  they  running hand  hand   queen went so fast    all she could do  keep up  her  still  queen kept crying “faster faster” but alice felt she could not go faster though she had not breath left  say so the most curious part   thing was   trees   other things round them never changed their places  all however fast they went they never seemed  pass anything “i wonder if all  things move along  us” thought poor puzzled alice and  queen seemed  guess her thoughts  she cried “faster don’t try  talk” not  alice had any idea  doing that she felt  if she would never  able  talk again she  getting so much out  breath  still  queen cried “faster faster”  dragged her along “are we nearly there” alice managed  pant out  last “nearly there”  queen repeated “why we passed  ten minutes ago faster” and they ran    time  silence   wind whistling  alice’s ears  almost blowing her hair off her head she fancied “now now” cried  queen “faster faster” and they went so fast   last they seemed  skim through  air hardly touching  ground  their feet till suddenly just  alice  getting quite exhausted they stopped  she found herself sitting   ground breathless  giddy the queen propped her up against  tree  said kindly “you may rest  little now” alice looked round her  great surprise “why i do believe we’ve been under this tree  whole time everything’s just   was” “of course  is” said  queen “what would you have it” “well  our country” said alice still panting  little “you’d generally get  somewhere else—if you ran very fast   long time  we’ve been doing” “a slow sort  country” said  queen “now here you see  takes all  running you can do  keep   same place if you want  get somewhere else you must run  least twice  fast  that” “i’d rather not try please” said alice “i’m quite content  stay here—only i am so hot  thirsty” “i know what you’d like”  queen said goodnaturedly taking  little box out  her pocket “have  biscuit” alice thought  would not  civil  say “no” though  wasn’t  all what she wanted so she took it  ate   well  she could    very dry  she thought she had never been so nearly choked  all her life “while you’re refreshing yourself” said  queen “i’ll just take  measurements” and she took  ribbon out  her pocket marked  inches  began measuring  ground  sticking little pegs  here  there “at  end  two yards” she said putting   peg  mark  distance “i shall give you your directions—have another biscuit” “no thank you” said alice “one’s quite enough” “thirst quenched i hope” said  queen alice did not know what  say  this but luckily  queen did not wait   answer but went on “at  end  three yards i shall repeat them—for fear  your forgetting them at  end  four i shall say goodbye and   end  five i shall go” she had got all  pegs put   this time  alice looked   great interest  she returned   tree  then began slowly walking down  row at  twoyard peg she faced round  said “a pawn goes two squares   first move you know so you’ll go very quickly through  third square—by railway i should think—and you’ll find yourself   fourth square  no time well that square belongs  tweedledum  tweedledee—the fifth  mostly water—the sixth belongs  humpty dumpty—but you make no remark” “i—i didn’t know i had  make one—just then” alice faltered out “you should have said ‘it’s extremely kind  you  tell me all this’—however we’ll suppose  said—the seventh square  all forest—however one   knights  show you  way—and   eighth square we shall  queens together  it’s all feasting  fun” alice got up  curtseyed  sat down again at  next peg  queen turned again  this time she said “speak  french when you can’t think   english   thing—turn out your toes  you walk—and remember who you are” she did not wait  alice  curtsey this time but walked  quickly   next peg where she turned   moment  say “goodbye”  then hurried    last how  happened alice never knew but exactly  she came   last peg she  gone whether she vanished into  air or whether she ran quickly into  wood “and she can run very fast” thought alice there  no way  guessing but she  gone  alice began  remember  she   pawn    would soon  time  her  move chapter iii lookingglass insects of course  first thing  do   make  grand survey   country she  going  travel through “it’s something very like learning geography” thought alice  she stood  tiptoe  hopes  being able  see  little further “principal rivers—there are none principal mountains—i’m   only one but i don’t think it’s got any name principal towns—why what are those creatures making honey down there they can’t  bees—nobody ever saw bees  mile off you know—”   some time she stood silent watching one  them   bustling about among  flowers poking  proboscis into them “just  if    regular bee” thought alice however this  anything but  regular bee  fact    elephant—as alice soon found out though  idea quite took her breath away  first “and what enormous flowers they must be”  her next idea “something like cottages   roofs taken off  stalks put  them—and what quantities  honey they must make i think i’ll go down and—no i won’t just yet” she went on checking herself just  she  beginning  run down  hill  trying  find some excuse  turning shy so suddenly “it’ll never do  go down among them without  good long branch  brush them away—and what fun it’ll  when they ask me how i like my walk i shall say—‘oh i like  well enough—’” here came  favourite little toss   head “‘only   so dusty  hot   elephants did tease so’” “i think i’ll go down  other way” she said after  pause “and perhaps i may visit  elephants later on besides i do so want  get into  third square” so  this excuse she ran down  hill  jumped over  first   six little brooks                     “tickets please” said  guard putting his head    window in  moment everybody  holding out  ticket they  about  same size   people  quite seemed  fill  carriage “now then show your ticket child”  guard went on looking angrily  alice and  great many voices all said together “like  chorus   song” thought alice “don’t keep him waiting child why his time  worth  thousand pounds  minute” “i’m afraid i haven’t got one” alice said   frightened tone “there wasn’t  ticketoffice where i came from” and again  chorus  voices went on “there wasn’t room  one where she came from the land there  worth  thousand pounds  inch” “don’t make excuses” said  guard “you should have bought one   enginedriver” and once more  chorus  voices went   “the man  drives  engine why  smoke alone  worth  thousand pounds  puff” alice thought  herself “then there’s no use  speaking” the voices didn’t join  this time  she hadn’t spoken but  her great surprise they all thought  chorus i hope you understand what thinking  chorus means—for i must confess  i don’t “better say nothing  all language  worth  thousand pounds  word” “i shall dream about  thousand pounds tonight i know i shall” thought alice all this time  guard  looking  her first through  telescope then through  microscope  then through  operaglass at last  said “you’re travelling  wrong way”  shut up  window  went away “so young  child” said  gentleman sitting opposite  her he  dressed  white paper “ought  know which way she’s going even if she doesn’t know her own name” a goat   sitting next   gentleman  white shut his eyes  said   loud voice “she ought  know her way   ticketoffice even if she doesn’t know her alphabet” there   beetle sitting next   goat it   very queer carriagefull  passengers altogether and   rule seemed    they should all speak  turn he went   “she’ll have  go back  here  luggage” alice couldn’t see who  sitting beyond  beetle but  hoarse voice spoke next “change engines—”  said   obliged  leave off “it sounds like  horse” alice thought  herself and  extremely small voice close  her ear said “you might make  joke  that—something about ‘horse’  ‘hoarse’ you know” then  very gentle voice   distance said “she must  labelled ‘lass  care’ you know—” and after  other voices went  “what  number  people there    carriage” thought alice saying “she must go  post  she’s got  head  her—” “she must  sent   message   telegraph—” “she must draw  train herself  rest   way—”  so on but  gentleman dressed  white paper leaned forwards  whispered  her ear “never mind what they all say my dear but take  returnticket every time  train stops” “indeed i shan’t” alice said rather impatiently “i don’t belong  this railway journey  all—i    wood just now—and i wish i could get back there” “you might make  joke  that” said  little voice close  her ear “something about ‘you would if you could’ you know” “don’t tease so” said alice looking about  vain  see where  voice came from “if you’re so anxious  have  joke made why don’t you make one yourself” the little voice sighed deeply   very unhappy evidently  alice would have said something pitying  comfort it “if  would only sigh like other people” she thought but this  such  wonderfully small sigh  she wouldn’t have heard   all if  hadn’t come quite close  her ear the consequence  this    tickled her ear very much  quite took off her thoughts   unhappiness   poor little creature “i know you   friend”  little voice went on “a dear friend   old friend and you won’t hurt me though i am  insect” “what kind  insect” alice inquired  little anxiously what she really wanted  know was whether  could sting or not but she thought this wouldn’t  quite  civil question  ask “what then you don’t—”  little voice began when   drowned   shrill scream   engine  everybody jumped up  alarm alice among  rest the horse who had put his head out   window quietly drew    said “it’s only  brook we have  jump over” everybody seemed satisfied  this though alice felt  little nervous   idea  trains jumping  all “however it’ll take us into  fourth square that’s some comfort” she said  herself in another moment she felt  carriage rise straight up into  air   her fright she caught   thing nearest  her hand which happened    goat’s beard                     but  beard seemed  melt away  she touched it  she found herself sitting quietly under  tree—while  gnat for    insect she had been talking to  balancing itself   twig just over her head  fanning her   wings it certainly   very large gnat “about  size   chicken” alice thought still she couldn’t feel nervous  it after they had been talking together so long “—then you don’t like all insects”  gnat went on  quietly  if nothing had happened “i like them when they can talk” alice said “none  them ever talk where i come from” “what sort  insects do you rejoice in where you come from”  gnat inquired “i don’t rejoice  insects  all” alice explained “because i’m rather afraid  them—at least  large kinds but i can tell you  names  some  them” “of course they answer  their names”  gnat remarked carelessly “i never knew them  do it” “what’s  use  their having names”  gnat said “if they won’t answer  them” “no use  them” said alice “but it’s useful   people who name them i suppose if not why do things have names  all” “i can’t say”  gnat replied “further on   wood down there they’ve got no names—however go   your list  insects you’re wasting time” “well there’s  horsefly” alice began counting off  names  her fingers “all right” said  gnat “half way up  bush you’ll see  rockinghorsefly if you look it’s made entirely  wood  gets about  swinging itself  branch  branch” “what does  live on” alice asked  great curiosity “sap  sawdust” said  gnat “go    list” alice looked up   rockinghorsefly  great interest  made up her mind   must have been just repainted  looked so bright  sticky  then she went on “and there’s  dragonfly” “look   branch above your head” said  gnat “and there you’ll find  snapdragonfly its body  made  plumpudding  wings  hollyleaves   head   raisin burning  brandy” “and what does  live on” “frumenty  mince pie”  gnat replied “and  makes  nest   christmas box” “and then there’s  butterfly” alice went on after she had taken  good look   insect   head  fire  had thought  herself “i wonder if that’s  reason insects  so fond  flying into candles—because they want  turn into snapdragonflies” “crawling  your feet” said  gnat alice drew her feet back  some alarm “you may observe  breadandbutterfly its wings  thin slices  breadandbutter  body   crust   head   lump  sugar” “and what does it live on” “weak tea  cream  it” a new difficulty came into alice’s head “supposing  couldn’t find any” she suggested “then  would die  course” “but  must happen very often” alice remarked thoughtfully “it always happens” said  gnat after this alice  silent   minute or two pondering the gnat amused itself meanwhile  humming round  round her head  last  settled again  remarked “i suppose you don’t want  lose your name” “no indeed” alice said  little anxiously “and yet i don’t know”  gnat went    careless tone “only think how convenient  would  if you could manage  go home without it for instance if  governess wanted  call you  your lessons she would call out ‘come here—’  there she would have  leave off because there wouldn’t  any name  her  call   course you wouldn’t have  go you know” “that would never do i’m sure” said alice “the governess would never think  excusing me lessons  that if she couldn’t remember my name she’d call me ‘miss’   servants do” “well if she said ‘miss’  didn’t say anything more”  gnat remarked “of course you’d miss your lessons that’s  joke i wish you had made it” “why do you wish i had made it” alice asked “it’s  very bad one” but  gnat only sighed deeply while two large tears came rolling down  cheeks “you shouldn’t make jokes” alice said “if  makes you so unhappy” then came another  those melancholy little sighs  this time  poor gnat really seemed  have sighed itself away for when alice looked up there  nothing whatever   seen   twig and  she  getting quite chilly  sitting still so long she got up  walked on she very soon came   open field   wood   other side  it  looked much darker than  last wood  alice felt  little timid about going into it however  second thoughts she made up her mind  go on “for i certainly won’t go back” she thought  herself  this   only way   eighth square “this must   wood” she said thoughtfully  herself “where things have no names i wonder what’ll become  my name when i go in i shouldn’t like  lose   all—because they’d have  give me another   would  almost certain    ugly one but then  fun would  trying  find  creature  had got my old name that’s just like  advertisements you know when people lose dogs—‘answers   name  “dash” had   brass collar’—just fancy calling everything you met ‘alice’ till one  them answered only they wouldn’t answer  all if they  wise” she  rambling   this way when she reached  wood  looked very cool  shady “well  any rate it’s  great comfort” she said  she stepped under  trees “after being so hot  get into the—into what” she went on rather surprised  not being able  think   word “i mean  get under the—under the—under this you know” putting her hand   trunk   tree “what does  call itself i wonder i do believe it’s got no name—why   sure  hasn’t” she stood silent   minute thinking then she suddenly began again “then  really has happened after all and now who am i i will remember if i can i’m determined  do it” but being determined didn’t help much  all she could say after  great deal  puzzling was “l i know  begins  l” just then  fawn came wandering by  looked  alice   large gentle eyes but didn’t seem  all frightened “here then here then” alice said  she held out her hand  tried  stroke it but  only started back  little  then stood looking  her again “what do you call yourself”  fawn said  last such  soft sweet voice  had “i wish i knew” thought poor alice she answered rather sadly “nothing just now” “think again”  said “that won’t do” alice thought but nothing came  it “please would you tell me what you call yourself” she said timidly “i think  might help  little” “i’ll tell you if you’ll move  little further on”  fawn said “i can’t remember here” so they walked  together though  wood alice  her arms clasped lovingly round  soft neck   fawn till they came out into another open field  here  fawn gave  sudden bound into  air  shook itself free  alice’s arms “i’m  fawn”  cried out   voice  delight “and dear me you’re  human child” a sudden look  alarm came into  beautiful brown eyes   another moment  had darted away  full speed alice stood looking after it almost ready  cry  vexation  having lost her dear little fellowtraveller so suddenly “however i know my name now” she said “that’s some comfort alice—alice—i won’t forget  again and now which  these fingerposts ought i  follow i wonder” it  not  very difficult question  answer  there  only one road through  wood   two fingerposts both pointed along it “i’ll settle it” alice said  herself “when  road divides  they point different ways” but this did not seem likely  happen she went   on  long way but wherever  road divided there  sure   two fingerposts pointing  same way one marked “to tweedledum’s house”   other “to the house of tweedledee” “i do believe” said alice  last “that they live   same house i wonder i never thought   before—but i can’t stay there long i’ll just call  say ‘how d’you do’  ask them  way out   wood if i could only get   eighth square before  gets dark” so she wandered on talking  herself  she went till  turning  sharp corner she came upon two fat little men so suddenly  she could not help starting back but  another moment she recovered herself feeling sure  they must be chapter iv tweedledum and tweedledee they  standing under  tree each   arm round  other’s neck  alice knew which  which   moment because one  them had “dum” embroidered  his collar   other “dee” “i suppose they’ve each got ‘tweedle’ round   back   collar” she said  herself they stood so still  she quite forgot they  alive  she  just looking round  see if  word ‘tweedle’  written   back  each collar when she  startled   voice coming   one marked “dum” “if you think we’re waxworks”  said “you ought  pay you know waxworks weren’t made   looked   nothing nohow” “contrariwise” added  one marked “dee” “if you think we’re alive you ought  speak” “i’m sure i’m very sorry”  all alice could say   words   old song kept ringing through her head like  ticking   clock  she could hardly help saying them out loud— “tweedledum  tweedledee agreed  have  battle for tweedledum said tweedledee had spoiled his nice new rattle just then flew down  monstrous crow as black   tarbarrel which frightened both  heroes so they quite forgot their quarrel” “i know what you’re thinking about” said tweedledum “but  isn’t so nohow” “contrariwise” continued tweedledee “if   so  might be  if   so  would be but   isn’t  ain’t that’s logic” “i  thinking” alice said very politely “which   best way out  this wood it’s getting so dark would you tell me please” but  little men only looked  each other  grinned they looked so exactly like  couple  great schoolboys  alice couldn’t help pointing her finger  tweedledum  saying “first boy” “nohow” tweedledum cried out briskly  shut his mouth up again   snap “next boy” said alice passing   tweedledee though she felt quite certain  would only shout out “contrariwise”  so  did “you’ve been wrong” cried tweedledum “the first thing   visit   say ‘how d’ye do’  shake hands” and here  two brothers gave each other  hug  then they held out  two hands   free  shake hands  her alice did not like shaking hands  either  them first  fear  hurting  other one’s feelings so   best way out   difficulty she took hold  both hands  once  next moment they  dancing round   ring this seemed quite natural she remembered afterwards  she  not even surprised  hear music playing  seemed  come   tree under which they  dancing    done as well  she could make  out   branches rubbing one across  other like fiddles  fiddlesticks “but  certainly was funny” alice said afterwards when she  telling her sister  history  all this “to find myself singing ‘here we go round  mulberry bush’ i don’t know when i began it but somehow i felt  if i’d been singing   long long time” the other two dancers  fat  very soon out  breath “four times round  enough  one dance” tweedledum panted out  they left off dancing  suddenly  they had begun  music stopped   same moment then they let go  alice’s hands  stood looking  her   minute there   rather awkward pause  alice didn’t know how  begin  conversation  people she had just been dancing with “it would never do  say ‘how d’ye do’ now” she said  herself “we seem  have got beyond that somehow” “i hope you’re not much tired” she said  last “nohow and thank you very much  asking” said tweedledum “so much obliged” added tweedledee “you like poetry” “yees pretty well—some poetry” alice said doubtfully “would you tell me which road leads out   wood” “what shall i repeat  her” said tweedledee looking round  tweedledum  great solemn eyes  not noticing alice’s question “‘the walrus   carpenter’   longest” tweedledum replied giving his brother  affectionate hug tweedledee began instantly “the sun  shining—” here alice ventured  interrupt him “if it’s very long” she said  politely  she could “would you please tell me first which road—” tweedledee smiled gently  began again “the sun  shining   sea shining  all his might he did his very best  make the billows smooth  bright— and this  odd because   the middle   night the moon  shining sulkily because she thought  sun had got no business   there after  day  done— ‘it’s very rude  him’ she said ‘to come  spoil  fun’ the sea  wet  wet could be the sands  dry  dry you could not see  cloud because no cloud    sky no birds  flying over head— there  no birds  fly the walrus   carpenter were walking close  hand they wept like anything  see such quantities  sand ‘if this  only cleared away’ they said ‘it would  grand’ ‘if seven maids  seven mops swept   half  year do you suppose’  walrus said ‘that they could get  clear’ ‘i doubt it’ said  carpenter and shed  bitter tear ‘o oysters come  walk  us’ the walrus did beseech ‘a pleasant walk  pleasant talk along  briny beach we cannot do  more than four to give  hand  each’ the eldest oyster looked  him but never  word  said the eldest oyster winked his eye and shook his heavy head— meaning  say  did not choose to leave  oysterbed but four young oysters hurried up all eager   treat their coats  brushed their faces washed their shoes  clean  neat— and this  odd because you know they hadn’t any feet four other oysters followed them and yet another four and thick  fast they came  last and more  more  more— all hopping through  frothy waves and scrambling   shore the walrus   carpenter walked   mile or so and then they rested   rock conveniently low and all  little oysters stood and waited   row ‘the time  come’  walrus said ‘to talk  many things of shoes—and ships—and sealingwax— of cabbages—and kings— and why  sea  boiling hot— and whether pigs have wings’ ‘but wait  bit’  oysters cried ‘before we have our chat for some  us  out  breath and all  us  fat’ ‘no hurry’ said  carpenter they thanked him much  that ‘a loaf  bread’  walrus said ‘is what we chiefly need pepper  vinegar besides are very good indeed— now if you’re ready oysters dear we can begin  feed’ ‘but not  us’  oysters cried turning  little blue ‘after such kindness  would  a dismal thing  do’ ‘the night  fine’  walrus said ‘do you admire  view ‘it  so kind  you  come and you  very nice’ the carpenter said nothing but ‘cut us another slice i wish you  not quite so deaf— i’ve had  ask you twice’ ‘it seems  shame’  walrus said ‘to play them such  trick after we’ve brought them out so far and made them trot so quick’ the carpenter said nothing but ‘the butter’s spread too thick’ ‘i weep  you’  walrus said ‘i deeply sympathize’ with sobs  tears  sorted out those   largest size holding his pocket handkerchief before his streaming eyes ‘o oysters’ said  carpenter ‘you’ve had  pleasant run shall we  trotting home again’ but answer came there none— and   scarcely odd because they’d eaten every one” “i like  walrus best” said alice “because you see    little sorry   poor oysters” “he ate more than  carpenter though” said tweedledee “you see  held his handkerchief  front so   carpenter couldn’t count how many  took contrariwise” “that  mean” alice said indignantly “then i like  carpenter best—if  didn’t eat so many   walrus” “but  ate  many   could get” said tweedledum this   puzzler after  pause alice began “well they  both very unpleasant characters—” here she checked herself  some alarm  hearing something  sounded  her like  puffing   large steamengine   wood near them though she feared   more likely    wild beast “are there any lions or tigers about here” she asked timidly “it’s only  red king snoring” said tweedledee “come  look  him”  brothers cried  they each took one  alice’s hands  led her up  where  king  sleeping “isn’t   lovely sight” said tweedledum alice couldn’t say honestly   was he had  tall red nightcap on   tassel    lying crumpled up into  sort  untidy heap  snoring loud—“fit  snore his head off”  tweedledum remarked “i’m afraid he’ll catch cold  lying   damp grass” said alice who   very thoughtful little girl “he’s dreaming now” said tweedledee “and what do you think he’s dreaming about” alice said “nobody can guess that” “why about you” tweedledee exclaimed clapping his hands triumphantly “and if  left off dreaming about you where do you suppose you’d be” “where i am now  course” said alice “not you” tweedledee retorted contemptuously “you’d  nowhere why you’re only  sort  thing  his dream” “if  there king   wake” added tweedledum “you’d go out—bang—just like  candle” “i shouldn’t” alice exclaimed indignantly “besides if i’m only  sort  thing  his dream what  you i should like  know” “ditto” said tweedledum “ditto ditto” cried tweedledee he shouted this so loud  alice couldn’t help saying “hush you’ll  waking him i’m afraid if you make so much noise” “well  no use your talking about waking him” said tweedledum “when you’re only one   things  his dream you know very well you’re not real” “i am real” said alice  began  cry “you won’t make yourself  bit realler  crying” tweedledee remarked “there’s nothing  cry about” “if i wasn’t real” alice said—halflaughing through her tears  all seemed so ridiculous—“i shouldn’t  able  cry” “i hope you don’t suppose those  real tears” tweedledum interrupted   tone  great contempt “i know they’re talking nonsense” alice thought  herself “and it’s foolish  cry about it” so she brushed away her tears  went   cheerfully  she could “at any rate i’d better  getting out   wood  really it’s coming  very dark do you think it’s going  rain” tweedledum spread  large umbrella over himself  his brother  looked up into it “no i don’t think  is”  said “at least—not under here nohow” “but  may rain outside” “it may—if  chooses” said tweedledee “we’ve no objection contrariwise” “selfish things” thought alice  she  just going  say “goodnight”  leave them when tweedledum sprang out  under  umbrella  seized her   wrist “do you see that”  said   voice choking  passion  his eyes grew large  yellow all   moment   pointed   trembling finger   small white thing lying under  tree “it’s only  rattle” alice said after  careful examination   little white thing “not  rattlesnake you know” she added hastily thinking    frightened “only  old rattle—quite old  broken” “i knew  was” cried tweedledum beginning  stamp about wildly  tear his hair “it’s spoilt  course” here  looked  tweedledee who immediately sat down   ground  tried  hide himself under  umbrella alice laid her hand upon his arm  said   soothing tone “you needn’t  so angry about  old rattle” “but  isn’t old” tweedledum cried   greater fury than ever “it’s new i tell you—i bought  yesterday—my nice new rattle”  his voice rose   perfect scream all this time tweedledee  trying his best  fold up  umbrella  himself  it which  such  extraordinary thing  do   quite took off alice’s attention   angry brother but  couldn’t quite succeed   ended  his rolling over bundled up   umbrella  only his head out  there  lay opening  shutting his mouth  his large eyes—“looking more like  fish than anything else” alice thought “of course you agree  have  battle” tweedledum said   calmer tone “i suppose so”  other sulkily replied   crawled out   umbrella “only she must help us  dress up you know” so  two brothers went off handinhand into  wood  returned   minute  their arms full  things—such  bolsters blankets hearthrugs tablecloths dishcovers  coalscuttles “i hope you’re  good hand  pinning  tying strings” tweedledum remarked “every one  these things  got  go on somehow or other” alice said afterwards she had never seen such  fuss made about anything  all her life—the way those two bustled about—and  quantity  things they put on—and  trouble they gave her  tying strings  fastening buttons—“really they’ll  more like bundles  old clothes than anything else   time they’re ready” she said  herself  she arranged  bolster round  neck  tweedledee “to keep his head  being cut off”   said “you know”  added very gravely “it’s one   most serious things  can possibly happen  one   battle—to get one’s head cut off” alice laughed aloud but she managed  turn  into  cough  fear  hurting his feelings “do i look very pale” said tweedledum coming up  have his helmet tied on he called   helmet though  certainly looked much more like  saucepan “well—yes—a little” alice replied gently “i’m very brave generally”  went    low voice “only today i happen  have  headache” “and i’ve got  toothache” said tweedledee who had overheard  remark “i’m far worse off than you” “then you’d better not fight today” said alice thinking   good opportunity  make peace “we must have  bit   fight but i don’t care about going  long” said tweedledum “what’s  time now” tweedledee looked  his watch  said “halfpast four” “let’s fight till six  then have dinner” said tweedledum “very well”  other said rather sadly “and she can watch us—only you’d better not come very close”  added “i generally hit everything i can see—when i get really excited” “and i hit everything within reach” cried tweedledum “whether i can see  or not” alice laughed “you must hit  trees pretty often i should think” she said tweedledum looked round him   satisfied smile “i don’t suppose”  said “there’ll   tree left standing  ever so far round   time we’ve finished” “and all about  rattle” said alice still hoping  make them  little ashamed  fighting  such  trifle “i shouldn’t have minded  so much” said tweedledum “if  hadn’t been  new one” “i wish  monstrous crow would come” thought alice “there’s only one sword you know” tweedledum said  his brother “but you can have  umbrella—it’s quite  sharp only we must begin quick it’s getting  dark   can” “and darker” said tweedledee it  getting dark so suddenly  alice thought there must   thunderstorm coming on “what  thick black cloud  is” she said “and how fast  comes why i do believe it’s got wings” “it’s  crow” tweedledum cried out   shrill voice  alarm   two brothers took  their heels   out  sight   moment alice ran  little way into  wood  stopped under  large tree “it can never get  me here” she thought “it’s far too large  squeeze itself  among  trees but i wish  wouldn’t flap  wings so—it makes quite  hurricane   wood—here’s somebody’s shawl being blown away” chapter v wool  water she caught  shawl  she spoke  looked about   owner  another moment  white queen came running wildly through  wood  both arms stretched out wide  if she  flying  alice very civilly went  meet her   shawl “i’m very glad i happened     way” alice said  she helped her  put  her shawl again the white queen only looked  her   helpless frightened sort  way  kept repeating something   whisper  herself  sounded like “breadandbutter breadandbutter”  alice felt  if there    any conversation  all she must manage  herself so she began rather timidly “am i addressing  white queen” “well yes if you call  adressing” the queen said “it isn’t my notion   thing  all” alice thought  would never do  have  argument   very beginning  their conversation so she smiled  said “if your majesty  only tell me  right way  begin i’ll do   well  i can” “but i don’t want  done  all” groaned  poor queen “i’ve been adressing myself   last two hours” it would have been all  better   seemed  alice if she had got some one else  dress her she  so dreadfully untidy “every single thing’s crooked” alice thought  herself “and she’s all over pins—may i put your shawl straight  you” she added aloud “i don’t know what’s  matter  it”  queen said   melancholy voice “it’s out  temper i think i’ve pinned  here  i’ve pinned  there but there’s no pleasing it” “it can’t go straight you know if you pin  all  one side” alice said  she gently put  right  her “and dear me what  state your hair  in” “the brush  got entangled  it”  queen said   sigh “and i lost  comb yesterday” alice carefully released  brush  did her best  get  hair into order “come you look rather better now” she said after altering most   pins “but really you should have  lady’s maid” “i’m sure i’ll take you  pleasure”  queen said “twopence  week  jam every other day” alice couldn’t help laughing  she said “i don’t want you  hire me—and i don’t care  jam” “it’s very good jam” said  queen “well i don’t want any today  any rate” “you couldn’t have  if you did want it”  queen said “the rule is jam tomorrow  jam yesterday—but never jam today” “it must come sometimes  ‘jam today’” alice objected “no  can’t” said  queen “it’s jam every other day today isn’t any other day you know” “i don’t understand you” said alice “it’s dreadfully confusing” “that’s  effect  living backwards”  queen said kindly “it always makes one  little giddy  first—” “living backwards” alice repeated  great astonishment “i never heard  such  thing” “—but there’s one great advantage  it  one’s memory works both ways” “i’m sure mine only works one way” alice remarked “i can’t remember things before they happen” “it’s  poor sort  memory  only works backwards”  queen remarked “what sort  things do you remember best” alice ventured  ask “oh things  happened  week after next”  queen replied   careless tone “for instance now” she went on sticking  large piece  plaster  her finger  she spoke “there’s  king’s messenger he’s  prison now being punished   trial doesn’t even begin till next wednesday   course  crime comes last  all” “suppose  never commits  crime” said alice “that would  all  better wouldn’t it”  queen said  she bound  plaster round her finger   bit  ribbon alice felt there  no denying that “of course  would  all  better” she said “but  wouldn’t  all  better his being punished” “you’re wrong there  any rate” said  queen “were you ever punished” “only  faults” said alice “and you  all  better  it i know”  queen said triumphantly “yes but then i had done  things i  punished for” said alice “that makes all  difference” “but if you hadn’t done them”  queen said “that would have been better still better  better  better” her voice went higher  each “better” till  got quite   squeak  last alice  just beginning  say “there’s  mistake somewhere—” when  queen began screaming so loud  she had  leave  sentence unfinished “oh oh oh” shouted  queen shaking her hand about  if she wanted  shake  off “my finger’s bleeding oh oh oh oh” her screams  so exactly like  whistle   steamengine  alice had  hold both her hands over her ears “what is  matter” she said  soon  there   chance  making herself heard “have you pricked your finger” “i haven’t pricked  yet”  queen said “but i soon shall—oh oh oh” “when do you expect  do it” alice asked feeling very much inclined  laugh “when i fasten my shawl again”  poor queen groaned out “the brooch  come undone directly oh oh” as she said  words  brooch flew open   queen clutched wildly  it  tried  clasp  again “take care” cried alice “you’re holding  all crooked” and she caught   brooch but   too late  pin had slipped   queen had pricked her finger “that accounts   bleeding you see” she said  alice   smile “now you understand  way things happen here” “but why don’t you scream now” alice asked holding her hands ready  put over her ears again “why i’ve done all  screaming already” said  queen “what would   good  having  all over again” by this time   getting light “the crow must have flown away i think” said alice “i’m so glad it’s gone i thought    night coming on” “i wish i could manage   glad”  queen said “only i never can remember  rule you must  very happy living  this wood  being glad whenever you like” “only   so very lonely here” alice said   melancholy voice    thought  her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her cheeks “oh don’t go  like that” cried  poor queen wringing her hands  despair “consider what  great girl you are consider what  long way you’ve come today consider what o’clock  is consider anything only don’t cry” alice could not help laughing  this even   midst  her tears “can you keep  crying  considering things” she asked “that’s  way it’s done”  queen said  great decision “nobody can do two things  once you know let’s consider your age  begin with—how old  you” “i’m seven   half exactly” “you needn’t say ‘exactually’”  queen remarked “i can believe  without that now i’ll give you something  believe i’m just one hundred  one five months   day” “i can’t believe that” said alice “can’t you”  queen said   pitying tone “try again draw  long breath  shut your eyes” alice laughed “there’s no use trying” she said “one can’t believe impossible things” “i daresay you haven’t had much practice” said  queen “when i  your age i always did   halfanhour  day why sometimes i’ve believed  many  six impossible things before breakfast there goes  shawl again” the brooch had come undone  she spoke   sudden gust  wind blew  queen’s shawl across  little brook the queen spread out her arms again  went flying after it  this time she succeeded  catching   herself “i’ve got it” she cried   triumphant tone “now you shall see me pin   again all  myself” “then i hope your finger  better now” alice said very politely  she crossed  little brook after  queen                     “oh much better” cried  queen her voice rising   squeak  she went on “much beetter beetter beeeetter beeehh” the last word ended   long bleat so like  sheep  alice quite started she looked   queen who seemed  have suddenly wrapped herself up  wool alice rubbed her eyes  looked again she couldn’t make out what had happened  all was she   shop and   really—was  really  sheep   sitting   other side   counter rub  she could she could make nothing more  it she    little dark shop leaning  her elbows   counter  opposite  her   old sheep sitting   armchair knitting  every now  then leaving off  look  her through  great pair  spectacles “what   you want  buy”  sheep said  last looking up   moment  her knitting “i don’t quite know yet” alice said very gently “i should like  look all round me first if i might” “you may look  front  you   both sides if you like” said  sheep “but you can’t look all round you—unless you’ve got eyes   back  your head” but these   happened alice had not got so she contented herself  turning round looking   shelves  she came  them the shop seemed   full  all manner  curious things—but  oddest part   all was  whenever she looked hard  any shelf  make out exactly what  had  it  particular shelf  always quite empty though  others round   crowded  full  they could hold “things flow about so here” she said  last   plaintive tone after she had spent  minute or so  vainly pursuing  large bright thing  looked sometimes like  doll  sometimes like  workbox   always   shelf next above  one she  looking at “and this one   most provoking  all—but i’ll tell you what—” she added   sudden thought struck her “i’ll follow  up   very top shelf  all it’ll puzzle   go through  ceiling i expect” but even this plan failed  “thing” went through  ceiling  quietly  possible  if   quite used  it “are you  child or  teetotum”  sheep said  she took up another pair  needles “you’ll make me giddy soon if you go  turning round like that” she  now working  fourteen pairs  once  alice couldn’t help looking  her  great astonishment “how can she knit  so many”  puzzled child thought  herself “she gets more  more like  porcupine every minute” “can you row”  sheep asked handing her  pair  knittingneedles  she spoke “yes  little—but not  land—and not  needles—” alice  beginning  say when suddenly  needles turned into oars  her hands  she found they    little boat gliding along between banks so there  nothing   but  do her best “feather” cried  sheep  she took up another pair  needles this didn’t sound like  remark  needed any answer so alice said nothing but pulled away there  something very queer about  water she thought  every now  then  oars got fast  it  would hardly come out again “feather feather”  sheep cried again taking more needles “you’ll  catching  crab directly” “a dear little crab” thought alice “i should like that” “didn’t you hear me say ‘feather’”  sheep cried angrily taking up quite  bunch  needles “indeed i did” said alice “you’ve said  very often—and very loud please where are  crabs” “in  water  course” said  sheep sticking some   needles into her hair  her hands  full “feather i say” “why do you say ‘feather’ so often” alice asked  last rather vexed “i’m not  bird” “you are” said  sheep “you’re  little goose” this offended alice  little so there  no more conversation   minute or two while  boat glided gently on sometimes among beds  weeds which made  oars stick fast   water worse then ever  sometimes under trees but always   same tall riverbanks frowning over their heads “oh please there  some scented rushes” alice cried   sudden transport  delight “there really are—and such beauties” “you needn’t say ‘please’  me about “em”  sheep said without looking up  her knitting “i didn’t put “em there  i’m not going  take “em away” “no but i meant—please may we wait  pick some” alice pleaded “if you don’t mind stopping  boat   minute” “how am i  stop it” said  sheep “if you leave off rowing it’ll stop  itself” so  boat  left  drift down  stream   would till  glided gently  among  waving rushes and then  little sleeves  carefully rolled up   little arms  plunged  elbowdeep  get  rushes  good long way down before breaking them off—and   while alice forgot all about  sheep   knitting  she bent over  side   boat  just  ends  her tangled hair dipping into  water—while  bright eager eyes she caught  one bunch after another   darling scented rushes “i only hope  boat won’t tipple over” she said  herself “oh what  lovely one only i couldn’t quite reach it” “and  certainly did seem  little provoking “almost  if  happened  purpose” she thought that though she managed  pick plenty  beautiful rushes   boat glided by there  always  more lovely one  she couldn’t reach “the prettiest  always further” she said  last   sigh   obstinacy   rushes  growing so far off as  flushed cheeks  dripping hair  hands she scrambled back into her place  began  arrange her newfound treasures what mattered   her just then   rushes had begun  fade   lose all their scent  beauty   very moment  she picked them even real scented rushes you know last only  very little while—and these being dreamrushes melted away almost like snow  they lay  heaps  her feet—but alice hardly noticed this there  so many other curious things  think about they hadn’t gone much farther before  blade  one   oars got fast   water  wouldn’t come out again so alice explained  afterwards   consequence    handle   caught her under  chin and  spite   series  little shrieks  “oh oh oh”  poor alice  swept her straight off  seat  down among  heap  rushes however she wasn’t hurt   soon up again  sheep went   her knitting all  while just  if nothing had happened “that   nice crab you caught” she remarked  alice got back into her place very much relieved  find herself still   boat “was it i didn’t see it” said alice peeping cautiously over  side   boat into  dark water “i wish  hadn’t let go—i should so like  see  little crab  take home  me” but  sheep only laughed scornfully  went   her knitting “are there many crabs here” said alice “crabs  all sorts  things” said  sheep “plenty  choice only make up your mind now what do you want  buy” “to buy” alice echoed   tone   half astonished  half frightened—for  oars   boat   river had vanished all   moment  she  back again   little dark shop “i should like  buy  egg please” she said timidly “how do you sell them” “fivepence farthing  one—twopence  two”  sheep replied “then two  cheaper than one” alice said   surprised tone taking out her purse “only you must eat them both if you buy two” said  sheep “then i’ll have one please” said alice  she put  money down   counter for she thought  herself “they mightn’t   all nice you know” the sheep took  money  put  away   box then she said “i never put things into people’s hands—that would never do—you must get   yourself” and so saying she went off   other end   shop  set  egg upright   shelf “i wonder why  wouldn’t do” thought alice  she groped her way among  tables  chairs   shop  very dark towards  end “the egg seems  get further away  more i walk towards it let me see  this  chair why it’s got branches i declare how very odd  find trees growing here and actually here’s  little brook well this   very queerest shop i ever saw”                     so she went on wondering more  more  every step  everything turned into  tree  moment she came up  it  she quite expected  egg  do  same chapter vi humpty dumpty however  egg only got larger  larger  more  more human when she had come within  few yards  it she saw   had eyes   nose  mouth  when she had come close  it she saw clearly    humpty dumpty himself “it can’t  anybody else” she said  herself “i’m  certain  it  if his name  written all over his face” it might have been written  hundred times easily   enormous face humpty dumpty  sitting  his legs crossed like  turk   top   high wall—such  narrow one  alice quite wondered how  could keep his balance—and  his eyes  steadily fixed   opposite direction   didn’t take  least notice  her she thought  must   stuffed figure after all “and how exactly like  egg  is” she said aloud standing  her hands ready  catch him  she  every moment expecting him  fall “it’s very provoking” humpty dumpty said after  long silence looking away  alice   spoke “to  called  egg—very” “i said you looked like  egg sir” alice gently explained “and some eggs  very pretty you know” she added hoping  turn her remark into  sort   compliment “some people” said humpty dumpty looking away  her  usual “have no more sense than  baby” alice didn’t know what  say  this  wasn’t  all like conversation she thought   never said anything  her  fact his last remark  evidently addressed   tree—so she stood  softly repeated  herself— “humpty dumpty sat   wall humpty dumpty had  great fall all  king’s horses  all  king’s men couldn’t put humpty dumpty  his place again” “that last line  much too long   poetry” she added almost out loud forgetting  humpty dumpty would hear her “don’t stand there chattering  yourself like that” humpty dumpty said looking  her   first time “but tell me your name  your business” “my name  alice but—” “it’s  stupid enough name” humpty dumpty interrupted impatiently “what does  mean” “must  name mean something” alice asked doubtfully “of course  must” humpty dumpty said   short laugh “my name means  shape i am—and  good handsome shape  is too with  name like yours you might  any shape almost” “why do you sit out here all alone” said alice not wishing  begin  argument “why because there’s nobody  me” cried humpty dumpty “did you think i didn’t know  answer  that ask another” “don’t you think you’d  safer down   ground” alice went on not  any idea  making another riddle but simply  her goodnatured anxiety   queer creature “that wall  so very narrow” “what tremendously easy riddles you ask” humpty dumpty growled out “of course i don’t think so why if ever i did fall off—which there’s no chance of—but if i did—” here  pursed his lips  looked so solemn  grand  alice could hardly help laughing “if i did fall”  went on “the king  promised me—with his very own mouth—to—to—” “to send all his horses  all his men” alice interrupted rather unwisely “now i declare that’s too bad” humpty dumpty cried breaking into  sudden passion “you’ve been listening  doors—and behind trees—and down chimneys—or you couldn’t have known it” “i haven’t indeed” alice said very gently “it’s   book” “ah well they may write such things   book” humpty dumpty said   calmer tone “that’s what you call  history  england  is now take  good look  me i’m one   spoken   king i am mayhap you’ll never see such another   show you i’m not proud you may shake hands  me” and  grinned almost  ear  ear   leant forwards and  nearly  possible fell off  wall  doing so  offered alice his hand she watched him  little anxiously  she took it “if  smiled much more  ends  his mouth might meet behind” she thought “and then i don’t know what would happen  his head i’m afraid  would come off” “yes all his horses  all his men” humpty dumpty went on “they’d pick me up again   minute they would however this conversation  going   little too fast let’s go back   last remark but one” “i’m afraid i can’t quite remember it” alice said very politely “in  case we start fresh” said humpty dumpty “and it’s my turn  choose  subject—” “he talks about  just  if    game” thought alice “so here’s  question  you how old did you say you were” alice made  short calculation  said “seven years  six months” “wrong” humpty dumpty exclaimed triumphantly “you never said  word like it” “i though you meant ‘how old are you’” alice explained “if i’d meant that i’d have said it” said humpty dumpty alice didn’t want  begin another argument so she said nothing “seven years  six months” humpty dumpty repeated thoughtfully “an uncomfortable sort  age now if you’d asked my advice i’d have said ‘leave off  seven’—but it’s too late now” “i never ask advice about growing” alice said indignantly “too proud”  other inquired alice felt even more indignant  this suggestion “i mean” she said “that one can’t help growing older” “one can’t perhaps” said humpty dumpty “but two can with proper assistance you might have left off  seven” “what  beautiful belt you’ve got on” alice suddenly remarked they had had quite enough   subject  age she thought  if they really   take turns  choosing subjects   her turn now “at least” she corrected herself  second thoughts “a beautiful cravat i should have said—no  belt i mean—i beg your pardon” she added  dismay  humpty dumpty looked thoroughly offended  she began  wish she hadn’t chosen  subject “if i only knew” she thought  herself “which  neck  which  waist” evidently humpty dumpty  very angry though  said nothing   minute or two when  did speak again     deep growl “it  a—most—provoking—thing”  said  last “when  person doesn’t know  cravat   belt” “i know it’s very ignorant  me” alice said  so humble  tone  humpty dumpty relented “it’s  cravat child   beautiful one  you say it’s  present   white king  queen there now” “is  really” said alice quite pleased  find  she had chosen  good subject after all “they gave  me” humpty dumpty continued thoughtfully   crossed one knee over  other  clasped his hands round it “they gave  me—for  unbirthday present” “i beg your pardon” alice said   puzzled air “i’m not offended” said humpty dumpty “i mean what is  unbirthday present” “a present given when  isn’t your birthday  course” alice considered  little “i like birthday presents best” she said  last “you don’t know what you’re talking about” cried humpty dumpty “how many days  there   year” “three hundred  sixtyfive” said alice “and how many birthdays have you” “one” “and if you take one  three hundred  sixtyfive what remains” “three hundred  sixtyfour  course” humpty dumpty looked doubtful “i’d rather see  done  paper”  said alice couldn’t help smiling  she took out her memorandumbook  worked  sum  him      humpty dumpty took  book  looked   carefully “that seems   done right—”  began “you’re holding  upside down” alice interrupted “to  sure i was” humpty dumpty said gaily  she turned  round  him “i thought  looked  little queer as i  saying  seems   done right—though i haven’t time  look  over thoroughly just now—and  shows  there  three hundred  sixtyfour days when you might get unbirthday presents—” “certainly” said alice “and only one  birthday presents you know there’s glory  you” “i don’t know what you mean  ‘glory’” alice said humpty dumpty smiled contemptuously “of course you don’t—till i tell you i meant ‘there’s  nice knockdown argument  you’” “but ‘glory’ doesn’t mean ‘a nice knockdown argument’” alice objected “when i use  word” humpty dumpty said  rather  scornful tone “it means just what i choose   mean—neither more nor less” “the question is” said alice “whether you can make words mean so many different things” “the question is” said humpty dumpty “which    master—that’s all” alice  too much puzzled  say anything so after  minute humpty dumpty began again “they’ve  temper some  them—particularly verbs they’re  proudest—adjectives you can do anything with but not verbs—however i can manage  whole lot  them impenetrability that’s what i say” “would you tell me please” said alice “what  means” “now you talk like  reasonable child” said humpty dumpty looking very much pleased “i meant  ‘impenetrability’  we’ve had enough   subject   would  just  well if you’d mention what you mean  do next  i suppose you don’t mean  stop here all  rest  your life” “that’s  great deal  make one word mean” alice said   thoughtful tone “when i make  word do  lot  work like that” said humpty dumpty “i always pay  extra” “oh” said alice she  too much puzzled  make any other remark “ah you should see “em come round me   saturday night” humpty dumpty went on wagging his head gravely  side  side “for  get their wages you know” alice didn’t venture  ask what  paid them with  so you see i can’t tell you “you seem very clever  explaining words sir” said alice “would you kindly tell me  meaning   poem called ‘jabberwocky’” “let’s hear it” said humpty dumpty “i can explain all  poems   ever invented—and  good many  haven’t been invented just yet” this sounded very hopeful so alice repeated  first verse ’twas brillig   slithy toves did gyre  gimble   wabe all mimsy   borogoves and  mome raths outgrabe “that’s enough  begin with” humpty dumpty interrupted “there  plenty  hard words there ‘brillig’ means four o’clock   afternoon—the time when you begin broiling things  dinner” “that’ll do very well” said alice “and ‘slithy’” “well ‘slithy’ means ‘lithe  slimy’ ‘lithe’   same  ‘active’ you see it’s like  portmanteau—there  two meanings packed up into one word” “i see  now” alice remarked thoughtfully “and what  ‘toves’” “well ‘toves’  something like badgers—they’re something like lizards—and they’re something like corkscrews” “they must  very curious looking creatures” “they  that” said humpty dumpty “also they make their nests under sundials—also they live  cheese” “and what’s  ‘gyre’   ‘gimble’” “to ‘gyre’   go round  round like  gyroscope to ‘gimble’   make holes like  gimlet” “and ‘the wabe’   grassplot round  sundial i suppose” said alice surprised  her own ingenuity “of course  is it’s called ‘wabe’ you know because  goes  long way before it   long way behind it—” “and  long way beyond   each side” alice added “exactly so well then ‘mimsy’  ‘flimsy  miserable’ there’s another portmanteau  you and  ‘borogove’   thin shabbylooking bird   feathers sticking out all round—something like  live mop” “and then ‘mome raths’” said alice “i’m afraid i’m giving you  great deal  trouble” “well  ‘rath’   sort  green pig but ‘mome’ i’m not certain about i think it’s short  ‘from home’—meaning  they’d lost their way you know” “and what does ‘outgrabe’ mean” “well ‘outgrabing’  something between bellowing  whistling   kind  sneeze   middle however you’ll hear  done maybe—down   wood yonder—and when you’ve once heard  you’ll  quite content who’s been repeating all  hard stuff  you” “i read    book” said alice “but i had some poetry repeated  me much easier than that by—tweedledee i think  was” “as  poetry you know” said humpty dumpty stretching out one  his great hands “i can repeat poetry  well  other folk if  comes  that—” “oh  needn’t come  that” alice hastily said hoping  keep him  beginning “the piece i’m going  repeat”  went  without noticing her remark “was written entirely  your amusement” alice felt    case she really ought  listen  it so she sat down  said “thank you” rather sadly “in winter when  fields  white i sing this song  your delight— only i don’t sing it”  added   explanation “i see you don’t” said alice “if you can see whether i’m singing or not you’ve sharper eyes than most” humpty dumpty remarked severely alice  silent “in spring when woods  getting green i’ll try  tell you what i mean” “thank you very much” said alice “in summer when  days  long perhaps you’ll understand  song in autumn when  leaves  brown take pen  ink  write  down” “i will if i can remember  so long” said alice “you needn’t go  making remarks like that” humpty dumpty said “they’re not sensible  they put me out” “i sent  message   fish i told them ‘this  what i wish’ the little fishes   sea they sent  answer back  me the little fishes’ answer  ‘we cannot do it sir because—‘” “i’m afraid i don’t quite understand” said alice “it gets easier further on” humpty dumpty replied “i sent  them again  say ‘it   better  obey’ the fishes answered   grin ‘why what  temper you  in’ i told them once i told them twice they would not listen  advice i took  kettle large  new fit   deed i had  do my heart went hop my heart went thump i filled  kettle   pump then some one came  me  said ‘the little fishes   bed’ i said  him i said  plain ‘then you must wake them up again’ i said  very loud  clear i went  shouted  his ear” humpty dumpty raised his voice almost   scream   repeated this verse  alice thought   shudder “i wouldn’t have been  messenger  anything” “but   very stiff  proud he said ‘you needn’t shout so loud’ and   very proud  stiff he said ‘i’d go  wake them if—’ i took  corkscrew   shelf i went  wake them up myself and when i found  door  locked i pulled  pushed  kicked  knocked and when i found  door  shut i tried  turn  handle but—” there   long pause “is  all” alice timidly asked “that’s all” said humpty dumpty “goodbye” this  rather sudden alice thought but after such  very strong hint  she ought   going she felt   would hardly  civil  stay so she got up  held out her hand “goodbye till we meet again” she said  cheerfully  she could “i shouldn’t know you again if we did meet” humpty dumpty replied   discontented tone giving her one  his fingers  shake “you’re so exactly like other people” “the face  what one goes by generally” alice remarked   thoughtful tone “that’s just what i complain of” said humpty dumpty “your face   same  everybody has—the two eyes so—” marking their places   air  this thumb “nose   middle mouth under it’s always  same now if you had  two eyes   same side   nose  instance—or  mouth   top—that would  some help” “it wouldn’t look nice” alice objected but humpty dumpty only shut his eyes  said “wait till you’ve tried” alice waited  minute  see if  would speak again but   never opened his eyes or took any further notice  her she said “goodbye” once more and getting no answer  this she quietly walked away but she couldn’t help saying  herself  she went “of all  unsatisfactory—” she repeated this aloud     great comfort  have such  long word  say “of all  unsatisfactory people i ever met—” she never finished  sentence   this moment  heavy crash shook  forest  end  end chapter vii the lion   unicorn the next moment soldiers came running through  wood  first  twos  threes then ten or twenty together   last  such crowds  they seemed  fill  whole forest alice got behind  tree  fear  being run over  watched them go by she thought   all her life she had never seen soldiers so uncertain  their feet they  always tripping over something or other  whenever one went down several more always fell over him so   ground  soon covered  little heaps  men then came  horses having four feet these managed rather better than  footsoldiers but even they stumbled now  then   seemed    regular rule that whenever  horse stumbled  rider fell off instantly the confusion got worse every moment  alice  very glad  get out   wood into  open place where she found  white king seated   ground busily writing  his memorandumbook “i’ve sent them all”  king cried   tone  delight  seeing alice “did you happen  meet any soldiers my dear  you came through  wood” “yes i did” said alice “several thousand i should think” “four thousand two hundred  seven that’s  exact number”  king said referring  his book “i couldn’t send all  horses you know because two  them  wanted   game and i haven’t sent  two messengers either they’re both gone   town just look along  road  tell me if you can see either  them” “i see nobody   road” said alice “i only wish i had such eyes”  king remarked   fretful tone “to  able  see nobody and   distance too why it’s  much  i can do  see real people  this light” all this  lost  alice who  still looking intently along  road shading her eyes  one hand “i see somebody now” she exclaimed  last “but he’s coming very slowly—and what curious attitudes  goes into” for  messenger kept skipping up  down  wriggling like  eel   came along  his great hands spread out like fans  each side “not  all” said  king “he’s  anglosaxon messenger—and those  anglosaxon attitudes he only does them when he’s happy his name  haigha” he pronounced  so   rhyme  “mayor” “i love my love   h” alice couldn’t help beginning “because   happy i hate him   h because   hideous i fed him with—with—with hamsandwiches  hay his name  haigha   lives—” “he lives   hill”  king remarked simply without  least idea    joining   game while alice  still hesitating   name   town beginning  h “the other messenger’s called hatta i must have two you know—to come  go one  come  one  go” “i beg your pardon” said alice “it isn’t respectable  beg” said  king “i only meant  i didn’t understand” said alice “why one  come  one  go” “didn’t i tell you”  king repeated impatiently “i must have two—to fetch  carry one  fetch  one  carry” at this moment  messenger arrived   far too much out  breath  say  word  could only wave his hands about  make  most fearful faces   poor king “this young lady loves you   h”  king said introducing alice   hope  turning off  messenger’s attention  himself—but   no use—the anglosaxon attitudes only got more extraordinary every moment while  great eyes rolled wildly  side  side “you alarm me” said  king “i feel faint—give me  ham sandwich” on which  messenger  alice’s great amusement opened  bag  hung round his neck  handed  sandwich   king who devoured  greedily “another sandwich” said  king “there’s nothing but hay left now”  messenger said peeping into  bag “hay then”  king murmured   faint whisper alice  glad  see   revived him  good deal “there’s nothing like eating hay when you’re faint”  remarked  her   munched away “i should think throwing cold water over you would  better” alice suggested “or some salvolatile” “i didn’t say there  nothing better”  king replied “i said there  nothing like it” which alice did not venture  deny “who did you pass   road”  king went on holding out his hand   messenger  some more hay “nobody” said  messenger “quite right” said  king “this young lady saw him too so  course nobody walks slower than you” “i do my best”  messenger said   sulky tone “i’m sure nobody walks much faster than i do” “he can’t do that” said  king “or else he’d have been here first however now you’ve got your breath you may tell us what’s happened   town” “i’ll whisper it” said  messenger putting his hands  his mouth   shape   trumpet  stooping so   get close   king’s ear alice  sorry  this  she wanted  hear  news too however instead  whispering  simply shouted   top  his voice “they’re   again” “do you call that  whisper” cried  poor king jumping up  shaking himself “if you do such  thing again i’ll have you buttered it went through  through my head like  earthquake” “it would have    very tiny earthquake” thought alice “who    again” she ventured  ask “why  lion   unicorn  course” said  king “fighting   crown” “yes   sure” said  king “and  best   joke is  it’s my crown all  while let’s run  see them” and they trotted off alice repeating  herself  she ran  words   old song— “the lion   unicorn  fighting   crown the lion beat  unicorn all round  town some gave them white bread some gave them brown some gave them plumcake  drummed them out  town” “does—the one—that wins—get  crown” she asked  well  she could   run  putting her quite out  breath “dear me no” said  king “what  idea” “would you—be good enough” alice panted out after running  little further “to stop  minute—just  get—one’s breath again” “i’m good enough”  king said “only i’m not strong enough you see  minute goes  so fearfully quick you might  well try  stop  bandersnatch” alice had no more breath  talking so they trotted   silence till they came  sight   great crowd   middle  which  lion  unicorn  fighting they   such  cloud  dust   first alice could not make out which  which but she soon managed  distinguish  unicorn  his horn they placed themselves close  where hatta  other messenger  standing watching  fight   cup  tea  one hand   piece  breadandbutter   other “he’s only just out  prison   hadn’t finished his tea when   sent in” haigha whispered  alice “and they only give them oystershells  there—so you see he’s very hungry  thirsty how  you dear child”  went on putting his arm affectionately round hatta’s neck hatta looked round  nodded  went   his bread  butter “were you happy  prison dear child” said haigha hatta looked round once more  this time  tear or two trickled down his cheek but not  word would  say “speak can’t you” haigha cried impatiently but hatta only munched away  drank some more tea “speak won’t you” cried  king “how  they getting    fight” hatta made  desperate effort  swallowed  large piece  breadandbutter “they’re getting  very well”  said   choking voice “each  them  been down about eightyseven times” “then i suppose they’ll soon bring  white bread   brown” alice ventured  remark “it’s waiting  “em now” said hatta “this   bit    i’m eating” there   pause   fight just then   lion   unicorn sat down panting while  king called out “ten minutes allowed  refreshments” haigha  hatta set  work  once carrying rough trays  white  brown bread alice took  piece  taste but   very dry “i don’t think they’ll fight any more today”  king said  hatta “go  order  drums  begin” and hatta went bounding away like  grasshopper for  minute or two alice stood silent watching him suddenly she brightened up “look look” she cried pointing eagerly “there’s  white queen running across  country she came flying out   wood over yonder—how fast those queens can run” “there’s some enemy after her no doubt”  king said without even looking round “that wood’s full  them” “but aren’t you going  run  help her” alice asked very much surprised  his taking  so quietly “no use no use” said  king “she runs so fearfully quick you might  well try  catch  bandersnatch but i’ll make  memorandum about her if you like—she’s  dear good creature”  repeated softly  himself   opened his memorandumbook “do you spell ‘creature’   double ‘e’” at this moment  unicorn sauntered  them  his hands  his pockets “i had  best   this time”  said   king just glancing  him   passed “a little—a little”  king replied rather nervously “you shouldn’t have run him through  your horn you know” “it didn’t hurt him”  unicorn said carelessly    going on when his eye happened  fall upon alice  turned round rather instantly  stood  some time looking  her   air   deepest disgust “what—is—this”  said  last “this   child” haigha replied eagerly coming  front  alice  introduce her  spreading out both his hands towards her   anglosaxon attitude “we only found  today it’s  large  life  twice  natural” “i always thought they  fabulous monsters” said  unicorn “is  alive” “it can talk” said haigha solemnly the unicorn looked dreamily  alice  said “talk child” alice could not help her lips curling up into  smile  she began “do you know i always thought unicorns  fabulous monsters too i never saw one alive before” “well now  we have seen each other” said  unicorn “if you’ll believe  me i’ll believe  you is   bargain” “yes if you like” said alice “come fetch out  plumcake old man”  unicorn went on turning  her   king “none  your brown bread  me” “certainly—certainly”  king muttered  beckoned  haigha “open  bag”  whispered “quick not  one—that’s full  hay” haigha took  large cake out   bag  gave   alice  hold while  got out  dish  carvingknife how they all came out   alice couldn’t guess it  just like  conjuringtrick she thought the lion had joined them while this  going on  looked very tired  sleepy  his eyes  half shut “what’s this”  said blinking lazily  alice  speaking   deep hollow tone  sounded like  tolling   great bell “ah what is it now”  unicorn cried eagerly “you’ll never guess i couldn’t” the lion looked  alice wearily “are you animal—vegetable—or mineral”  said yawning  every other word “it’s  fabulous monster”  unicorn cried out before alice could reply “then hand round  plumcake monster”  lion said lying down  putting his chin  his paws “and sit down both  you” to  king   unicorn “fair play   cake you know” the king  evidently very uncomfortable  having  sit down between  two great creatures but there  no other place  him “what  fight we might have   crown now”  unicorn said looking slyly up   crown which  poor king  nearly shaking off his head  trembled so much “i should win easy” said  lion “i’m not so sure  that” said  unicorn “why i beat you all round  town you chicken”  lion replied angrily half getting up   spoke here  king interrupted  prevent  quarrel going on   very nervous  his voice quite quivered “all round  town”  said “that’s  good long way did you go   old bridge or  marketplace you get  best view   old bridge” “i’m sure i don’t know”  lion growled out   lay down again “there  too much dust  see anything what  time  monster is cutting up  cake” alice had seated herself   bank   little brook   great dish  her knees   sawing away diligently   knife “it’s very provoking” she said  reply   lion she  getting quite used  being called “the monster” “i’ve cut several slices already but they always join  again” “you don’t know how  manage lookingglass cakes”  unicorn remarked “hand  round first  cut  afterwards” this sounded nonsense but alice very obediently got up  carried  dish round   cake divided itself into three pieces  she did so “now cut  up” said  lion  she returned  her place   empty dish “i say this isn’t fair” cried  unicorn  alice sat   knife  her hand very much puzzled how  begin “the monster  given  lion twice  much  me” “she’s kept none  herself anyhow” said  lion “do you like plumcake monster” but before alice could answer him  drums began where  noise came from she couldn’t make out  air seemed full  it   rang through  through her head till she felt quite deafened she started  her feet  sprang across  little brook  her terror                      had just time  see  lion   unicorn rise  their feet  angry looks  being interrupted  their feast before she dropped  her knees  put her hands over her ears vainly trying  shut out  dreadful uproar “if that doesn’t ‘drum them out  town’” she thought  herself “nothing ever will” chapter viii “it’s my own invention” after  while  noise seemed gradually  die away till all  dead silence  alice lifted up her head  some alarm there  no one   seen  her first thought   she must have been dreaming about  lion   unicorn  those queer anglosaxon messengers however there   great dish still lying  her feet  which she had tried  cut  plumcake “so i wasn’t dreaming after all” she said  herself “unless—unless we’re all part   same dream only i do hope it’s my dream  not  red king’s i don’t like belonging  another person’s dream” she went    rather complaining tone “i’ve  great mind  go  wake him  see what happens” at this moment her thoughts  interrupted   loud shouting  “ahoy ahoy check”   knight dressed  crimson armour came galloping down upon her brandishing  great club just   reached her  horse stopped suddenly “you’re my prisoner”  knight cried   tumbled off his horse startled  she was alice  more frightened  him than  herself   moment  watched him  some anxiety   mounted again as soon    comfortably   saddle  began once more “you’re my—” but here another voice broke  “ahoy ahoy check”  alice looked round  some surprise   new enemy this time    white knight he drew up  alice’s side  tumbled off his horse just   red knight had done then  got  again   two knights sat  looked  each other  some time without speaking alice looked  one   other  some bewilderment “she’s my prisoner you know”  red knight said  last “yes but then i came  rescued her”  white knight replied “well we must fight  her then” said  red knight   took up his helmet which hung   saddle   something  shape   horse’s head  put  on “you  observe  rules  battle  course”  white knight remarked putting  his helmet too “i always do” said  red knight  they began banging away  each other  such fury  alice got behind  tree   out   way   blows “i wonder now what  rules  battle are” she said  herself  she watched  fight timidly peeping out  her hidingplace “one rule seems  be  if one knight hits  other  knocks him off his horse  if  misses  tumbles off himself—and another rule seems    they hold their clubs  their arms  if they  punch  judy—what  noise they make when they tumble just like  whole set  fireirons falling into  fender and how quiet  horses are they let them get   off them just  if they  tables” another rule  battle  alice had not noticed seemed    they always fell  their heads   battle ended  their both falling off  this way side  side when they got up again they shook hands  then  red knight mounted  galloped off “it   glorious victory wasn’t it” said  white knight   came up panting “i don’t know” alice said doubtfully “i don’t want   anybody’s prisoner i want    queen” “so you will when you’ve crossed  next brook” said  white knight “i’ll see you safe   end   wood—and then i must go back you know that’s  end  my move” “thank you very much” said alice “may i help you off  your helmet” it  evidently more than  could manage  himself however she managed  shake him out    last “now one can breathe more easily” said  knight putting back his shaggy hair  both hands  turning his gentle face  large mild eyes  alice she thought she had never seen such  strangelooking soldier  all her life he  dressed  tin armour which seemed  fit him very badly   had  queershaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder upsidedown    lid hanging open alice looked    great curiosity “i see you’re admiring my little box”  knight said   friendly tone “it’s my own invention—to keep clothes  sandwiches in you see i carry  upsidedown so   rain can’t get in” “but  things can get out” alice gently remarked “do you know  lid’s open” “i didn’t know it”  knight said  shade  vexation passing over his face “then all  things must have fallen out and  box  no use without them” he unfastened    spoke   just going  throw  into  bushes when  sudden thought seemed  strike him   hung  carefully   tree “can you guess why i did that”  said  alice alice shook her head “in hopes some bees may make  nest  it—then i should get  honey” “but you’ve got  beehive—or something like one—fastened   saddle” said alice “yes it’s  very good beehive”  knight said   discontented tone “one   best kind but not  single bee  come near  yet and  other thing   mousetrap i suppose  mice keep  bees out—or  bees keep  mice out i don’t know which” “i  wondering what  mousetrap  for” said alice “it isn’t very likely there would  any mice   horse’s back” “not very likely perhaps” said  knight “but if they do come i don’t choose  have them running all about” “you see”  went  after  pause “it’s  well   provided  everything that’s  reason  horse  all those anklets round his feet” “but what  they for” alice asked   tone  great curiosity “to guard against  bites  sharks”  knight replied “it’s  invention  my own and now help me on i’ll go  you   end   wood—what’s  dish for” “it’s meant  plumcake” said alice “we’d better take   us”  knight said “it’ll come  handy if we find any plumcake help me  get  into this bag” this took  very long time  manage though alice held  bag open very carefully because  knight  so very awkward  putting   dish  first two or three times   tried  fell  himself instead “it’s rather  tight fit you see”  said  they got    last “there  so many candlesticks   bag” and  hung    saddle which  already loaded  bunches  carrots  fireirons  many other things “i hope you’ve got your hair well fastened on”  continued  they set off “only   usual way” alice said smiling “that’s hardly enough”  said anxiously “you see  wind  so very strong here it’s  strong  soup” “have you invented  plan  keeping  hair  being blown off” alice enquired “not yet” said  knight “but i’ve got  plan  keeping   falling off” “i should like  hear it very much” “first you take  upright stick” said  knight “then you make your hair creep up it like  fruittree now  reason hair falls off  because  hangs down—things never fall upwards you know it’s  plan  my own invention you may try  if you like” it didn’t sound  comfortable plan alice thought    few minutes she walked   silence puzzling over  idea  every now  then stopping  help  poor knight who certainly  not  good rider whenever  horse stopped which  did very often  fell off  front  whenever  went  again which  generally did rather suddenly  fell off behind otherwise  kept  pretty well except   had  habit  now  then falling off sideways    generally did this   side  which alice  walking she soon found     best plan not  walk quite close   horse “i’m afraid you’ve not had much practice  riding” she ventured  say  she  helping him up  his fifth tumble the knight looked very much surprised   little offended   remark “what makes you say that”  asked   scrambled back into  saddle keeping hold  alice’s hair  one hand  save himself  falling over   other side “because people don’t fall off quite so often when they’ve had much practice” “i’ve had plenty  practice”  knight said very gravely “plenty  practice” alice could think  nothing better  say than “indeed” but she said   heartily  she could they went   little way  silence after this  knight  his eyes shut muttering  himself  alice watching anxiously   next tumble “the great art  riding”  knight suddenly began   loud voice waving his right arm   spoke “is  keep—” here  sentence ended  suddenly   had begun   knight fell heavily   top  his head exactly   path where alice  walking she  quite frightened this time  said   anxious tone  she picked him up “i hope no bones  broken” “none  speak of”  knight said  if  didn’t mind breaking two or three  them “the great art  riding  i  saying is—to keep your balance properly like this you know—” he let go  bridle  stretched out both his arms  show alice what  meant  this time  fell flat  his back right under  horse’s feet “plenty  practice”  went  repeating all  time  alice  getting him  his feet again “plenty  practice” “it’s too ridiculous” cried alice losing all her patience this time “you ought  have  wooden horse  wheels  you ought” “does  kind go smoothly”  knight asked   tone  great interest clasping his arms round  horse’s neck   spoke just  time  save himself  tumbling off again “much more smoothly than  live horse” alice said   little scream  laughter  spite  all she could do  prevent it “i’ll get one”  knight said thoughtfully  himself “one or two—several” there   short silence after this  then  knight went  again “i’m  great hand  inventing things now i daresay you noticed  last time you picked me up  i  looking rather thoughtful” “you were  little grave” said alice “well just then i  inventing  new way  getting over  gate—would you like  hear it” “very much indeed” alice said politely “i’ll tell you how i came  think  it” said  knight “you see i said  myself ‘the only difficulty    feet  head  high enough already’ now first i put my head   top   gate—then i stand  my head—then  feet  high enough you see—then i’m over you see” “yes i suppose you’d  over when   done” alice said thoughtfully “but don’t you think  would  rather hard” “i haven’t tried  yet”  knight said gravely “so i can’t tell  certain—but i’m afraid  would   little hard” he looked so vexed   idea  alice changed  subject hastily “what  curious helmet you’ve got” she said cheerfully “is  your invention too” the knight looked down proudly  his helmet which hung   saddle “yes”  said “but i’ve invented  better one than that—like  sugar loaf when i used  wear it if i fell off  horse  always touched  ground directly so i had  very little way  fall you see—but there was  danger  falling into it   sure that happened  me once—and  worst   was before i could get out again  other white knight came  put  on he thought   his own helmet” the knight looked so solemn about   alice did not dare  laugh “i’m afraid you must have hurt him” she said   trembling voice “being   top  his head” “i had  kick him  course”  knight said very seriously “and then  took  helmet off again—but  took hours  hours  get me out i   fast as—as lightning you know” “but that’s  different kind  fastness” alice objected the knight shook his head “it  all kinds  fastness  me i can assure you”  said he raised his hands  some excitement   said this  instantly rolled out   saddle  fell headlong into  deep ditch alice ran   side   ditch  look  him she  rather startled   fall   some time  had kept  very well  she  afraid   really was hurt this time however though she could see nothing but  soles  his feet she  much relieved  hear    talking   his usual tone “all kinds  fastness”  repeated “but   careless  him  put another man’s helmet on—with  man  it too” “how can you go  talking so quietly head downwards” alice asked  she dragged him out   feet  laid him   heap   bank the knight looked surprised   question “what does  matter where my body happens  be”  said “my mind goes  working all  same in fact  more head downwards i am  more i keep inventing new things” “now  cleverest thing   sort  i ever did”  went  after  pause “was inventing  new pudding during  meatcourse” “in time  have  cooked   next course” said alice “well not  next course”  knight said   slow thoughtful tone “no certainly not  next course” “then  would have    next day i suppose you wouldn’t have two puddingcourses  one dinner” “well not  next day”  knight repeated  before “not  next day in fact”  went on holding his head down  his voice getting lower  lower “i don’t believe  pudding ever was cooked in fact i don’t believe  pudding ever will  cooked and yet    very clever pudding  invent” “what did you mean    made of” alice asked hoping  cheer him up   poor knight seemed quite lowspirited about it “it began  blotting paper”  knight answered   groan “that wouldn’t  very nice i’m afraid—” “not very nice alone”  interrupted quite eagerly “but you’ve no idea what  difference  makes mixing   other things—such  gunpowder  sealingwax and here i must leave you” they had just come   end   wood alice could only look puzzled she  thinking   pudding “you  sad”  knight said   anxious tone “let me sing you  song  comfort you” “is  very long” alice asked  she had heard  good deal  poetry  day “it’s long” said  knight “but very very beautiful everybody  hears me sing it—either  brings  tears into their eyes or else—” “or else what” said alice   knight had made  sudden pause “or else  doesn’t you know the name   song  called ‘haddocks’ eyes’” “oh that’s  name   song  it” alice said trying  feel interested “no you don’t understand”  knight said looking  little vexed “that’s what  name  called the name really is ‘the aged aged man’” “then i ought  have said ‘that’s what  song  called’” alice corrected herself “no you oughtn’t that’s quite another thing the song  called ‘ways  means’ but that’s only what it’s called you know” “well what is  song then” said alice who   this time completely bewildered “i  coming  that”  knight said “the song really is ‘asitting on a gate’   tune’s my own invention” so saying  stopped his horse  let  reins fall   neck then slowly beating time  one hand    faint smile lighting up his gentle foolish face  if  enjoyed  music  his song  began of all  strange things  alice saw  her journey through the lookingglass this   one  she always remembered most clearly years afterwards she could bring  whole scene back again  if  had been only yesterday—the mild blue eyes  kindly smile   knight—the setting sun gleaming through his hair  shining  his armour   blaze  light  quite dazzled her—the horse quietly moving about   reins hanging loose  his neck cropping  grass  her feet—and  black shadows   forest behind—all this she took  like  picture as  one hand shading her eyes she leant against  tree watching  strange pair  listening   half dream   melancholy music   song “but  tune isn’t his own invention” she said  herself “it’s ‘i give thee all i can no more’” she stood  listened very attentively but no tears came into her eyes “i’ll tell thee everything i can there’s little  relate i saw  aged aged man asitting   gate ‘who  you aged man’ i said ‘and how   you live’ and his answer trickled through my head like water through  sieve he said ‘i look  butterflies that sleep among  wheat i make them into muttonpies and sell them   street i sell them unto men’  said ‘who sail  stormy seas and that’s  way i get my bread— a trifle if you please’ but i  thinking   plan to dye one’s whiskers green and always use so large  fan that they could not  seen so having no reply  give to what  old man said i cried ‘come tell me how you live’ and thumped him   head his accents mild took up  tale he said ‘i go my ways and when i find  mountainrill i set    blaze and thence they make  stuff they call rolands’ macassar oil— yet twopencehalfpenny  all they give me  my toil’ but i  thinking   way to feed oneself  batter and so go   day  day getting  little fatter i shook him well  side  side until his face  blue ‘come tell me how you live’ i cried ‘and what   you do’ he said ‘i hunt  haddocks’ eyes among  heather bright and work them into waistcoatbuttons in  silent night and these i do not sell  gold or coin  silvery shine but   copper halfpenny and   purchase nine ‘i sometimes dig  buttered rolls or set limed twigs  crabs i sometimes search  grassy knolls for wheels  hansomcabs and that’s  way’ he gave  wink ‘by which i get my wealth— and very gladly  i drink your honour’s noble health’ i heard him then  i had just completed my design to keep  menai bridge  rust by boiling   wine i thanked him much  telling me the way  got his wealth but chiefly  his wish   might drink my noble health and now if e’er  chance i put my fingers into glue or madly squeeze  righthand foot into  lefthand shoe or if i drop upon my toe a very heavy weight i weep   reminds me so of  old man i used  know— whose look  mild whose speech  slow whose hair  whiter than  snow whose face  very like  crow with eyes like cinders all aglow who seemed distracted  his woe who rocked his body   fro and muttered mumblingly  low as if his mouth  full  dough who snorted like  buffalo— that summer evening long ago asitting   gate” as  knight sang  last words   ballad  gathered up  reins  turned his horse’s head along  road  which they had come “you’ve only  few yards  go”  said “down  hill  over  little brook  then you’ll   queen—but you’ll stay  see me off first”  added  alice turned   eager look   direction  which  pointed “i shan’t  long you’ll wait  wave your handkerchief when i get   turn   road i think it’ll encourage me you see” “of course i’ll wait” said alice “and thank you very much  coming so far—and   song—i liked  very much” “i hope so”  knight said doubtfully “but you didn’t cry so much  i thought you would” so they shook hands  then  knight rode slowly away into  forest “it won’t take long  see him off i expect” alice said  herself  she stood watching him “there  goes right  his head  usual however  gets  again pretty easily—that comes  having so many things hung round  horse—” so she went  talking  herself  she watched  horse walking leisurely along  road   knight tumbling off first  one side  then   other after  fourth or fifth tumble  reached  turn  then she waved her handkerchief  him  waited till   out  sight “i hope  encouraged him” she said  she turned  run down  hill “and now   last brook     queen how grand  sounds” a very few steps brought her   edge   brook “the eighth square  last” she cried  she bounded across                      threw herself down  rest   lawn  soft  moss  little flowerbeds dotted about  here  there “oh how glad i am  get here and what is this  my head” she exclaimed   tone  dismay  she put her hands up  something very heavy  fitted tight all round her head “but how can  have got there without my knowing it” she said  herself  she lifted  off  set   her lap  make out what  could possibly be it   golden crown chapter ix queen alice “well this is grand” said alice “i never expected i should   queen so soon—and i’ll tell you what  is your majesty” she went    severe tone she  always rather fond  scolding herself “it’ll never do  you   lolling about   grass like that queens have   dignified you know” so she got up  walked about—rather stiffly just  first  she  afraid   crown might come off but she comforted herself   thought  there  nobody  see her “and if i really am  queen” she said  she sat down again “i shall  able  manage  quite well  time” everything  happening so oddly  she didn’t feel  bit surprised  finding  red queen   white queen sitting close  her one  each side she would have liked very much  ask them how they came there but she feared  would not  quite civil however there would  no harm she thought  asking if  game  over “please would you tell me—” she began looking timidly   red queen “speak when you’re spoken to” the queen sharply interrupted her “but if everybody obeyed  rule” said alice who  always ready   little argument “and if you only spoke when you  spoken to   other person always waited  you  begin you see nobody would ever say anything so that—” “ridiculous” cried  queen “why don’t you see child—” here she broke off   frown and after thinking   minute suddenly changed  subject   conversation “what do you mean  ‘if you really   queen’ what right have you  call yourself so you can’t   queen you know till you’ve passed  proper examination and  sooner we begin it  better” “i only said ‘if’” poor alice pleaded   piteous tone the two queens looked  each other   red queen remarked   little shudder “she says she only said ‘if’—” “but she said  great deal more than that”  white queen moaned wringing her hands “oh ever so much more than that” “so you did you know”  red queen said  alice “always speak  truth—think before you speak—and write  down afterwards” “i’m sure i didn’t mean—” alice  beginning but  red queen interrupted her impatiently “that’s just what i complain of you should have meant what do you suppose   use  child without any meaning even  joke should have some meaning—and  child’s more important than  joke i hope you couldn’t deny that even if you tried  both hands” “i don’t deny things  my hands” alice objected “nobody said you did” said  red queen “i said you couldn’t if you tried” “she’s   state  mind” said  white queen “that she wants  deny something—only she doesn’t know what  deny” “a nasty vicious temper”  red queen remarked  then there   uncomfortable silence   minute or two the red queen broke  silence  saying   white queen “i invite you  alice’s dinnerparty this afternoon” the white queen smiled feebly  said “and i invite you” “i didn’t know i   have  party  all” said alice “but if there    one i think i ought  invite  guests” “we gave you  opportunity  doing it”  red queen remarked “but i daresay you’ve not had many lessons  manners yet” “manners  not taught  lessons” said alice “lessons teach you  do sums  things   sort” “and you do addition”  white queen asked “what’s one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one  one” “i don’t know” said alice “i lost count” “she can’t do addition”  red queen interrupted “can you do subtraction take nine  eight” “nine  eight i can’t you know” alice replied very readily “but—” “she can’t do subtraction” said  white queen “can you do division divide  loaf   knife—what’s  answer  that” “i suppose—” alice  beginning but  red queen answered  her “breadandbutter  course try another subtraction sum take  bone   dog what remains” alice considered “the bone wouldn’t remain  course if i took it—and  dog wouldn’t remain  would come  bite me—and i’m sure i shouldn’t remain” “then you think nothing would remain” said  red queen “i think that’s  answer” “wrong  usual” said  red queen “the dog’s temper would remain” “but i don’t see how—” “why look here”  red queen cried “the dog would lose  temper wouldn’t it” “perhaps  would” alice replied cautiously “then if  dog went away  temper would remain”  queen exclaimed triumphantly alice said  gravely  she could “they might go different ways” but she couldn’t help thinking  herself “what dreadful nonsense we are talking” “she can’t do sums  bit”  queens said together  great emphasis “can you do sums” alice said turning suddenly   white queen  she didn’t like being found fault  so much the queen gasped  shut her eyes “i can do addition if you give me time—but i can’t do subtraction under any circumstances” “of course you know your a b c” said  red queen “to  sure i do” said alice “so do i”  white queen whispered “we’ll often say  over together dear and i’ll tell you  secret—i can read words  one letter isn’t that grand however don’t  discouraged you’ll come    time” here  red queen began again “can you answer useful questions” she said “how  bread made” “i know that” alice cried eagerly “you take some flour—” “where do you pick  flower”  white queen asked “in  garden or   hedges” “well  isn’t picked  all” alice explained “it’s ground—” “how many acres  ground” said  white queen “you mustn’t leave out so many things” “fan her head”  red queen anxiously interrupted “she’ll  feverish after so much thinking” so they set  work  fanned her  bunches  leaves till she had  beg them  leave off  blew her hair about so “she’s all right again now” said  red queen “do you know languages what’s  french  fiddlededee” “fiddlededee’s not english” alice replied gravely “who ever said  was” said  red queen alice thought she saw  way out   difficulty this time “if you’ll tell me what language ‘fiddlededee’ is i’ll tell you  french  it” she exclaimed triumphantly but  red queen drew herself up rather stiffly  said “queens never make bargains” “i wish queens never asked questions” alice thought  herself “don’t let us quarrel”  white queen said   anxious tone “what   cause  lightning” “the cause  lightning” alice said very decidedly  she felt quite certain about this “is  thunder—no no” she hastily corrected herself “i meant  other way” “it’s too late  correct it” said  red queen “when you’ve once said  thing  fixes it  you must take  consequences” “which reminds me—”  white queen said looking down  nervously clasping  unclasping her hands “we had such  thunderstorm last tuesday—i mean one   last set  tuesdays you know” alice  puzzled “in our country” she remarked “there’s only one day   time” the red queen said “that’s  poor thin way  doing things now here we mostly have days  nights two or three   time  sometimes   winter we take  many  five nights together—for warmth you know” “are five nights warmer than one night then” alice ventured  ask “five times  warm  course” “but they should  five times  cold   same rule—” “just so” cried  red queen “five times  warm and five times  cold—just  i’m five times  rich  you are and five times  clever” alice sighed  gave  up “it’s exactly like  riddle  no answer” she thought “humpty dumpty saw  too”  white queen went    low voice more  if she  talking  herself “he came   door   corkscrew  his hand—” “what did  want” said  red queen “he said  would come in”  white queen went on “because   looking   hippopotamus now   happened there wasn’t such  thing   house  morning” “is there generally” alice asked   astonished tone “well only  thursdays” said  queen “i know what  came for” said alice “he wanted  punish  fish because—” here  white queen began again “it  such  thunderstorm you can’t think” “she never could you know” said  red queen “and part   roof came off  ever so much thunder got in—and  went rolling round  room  great lumps—and knocking over  tables  things—till i  so frightened i couldn’t remember my own name” alice thought  herself “i never should try  remember my name   middle   accident where would   use  it” but she did not say this aloud  fear  hurting  poor queen’s feeling “your majesty must excuse her”  red queen said  alice taking one   white queen’s hands  her own  gently stroking it “she means well but she can’t help saying foolish things   general rule” the white queen looked timidly  alice who felt she ought  say something kind but really couldn’t think  anything   moment “she never  really well brought up”  red queen went on “but it’s amazing how goodtempered she is pat her   head  see how pleased she’ll be” but this  more than alice had courage  do “a little kindness—and putting her hair  papers—would do wonders  her—” the white queen gave  deep sigh  laid her head  alice’s shoulder “i am so sleepy” she moaned “she’s tired poor thing” said  red queen “smooth her hair—lend her your nightcap—and sing her  soothing lullaby” “i haven’t got  nightcap  me” said alice  she tried  obey  first direction “and i don’t know any soothing lullabies” “i must do  myself then” said  red queen  she began “hushaby lady  alice’s lap till  feast’s ready we’ve time   nap when  feast’s over we’ll go   ball— red queen  white queen  alice  all “and now you know  words” she added  she put her head down  alice’s other shoulder “just sing  through  me i’m getting sleepy too” in another moment both queens  fast asleep  snoring loud “what am i  do” exclaimed alice looking about  great perplexity  first one round head  then  other rolled down  her shoulder  lay like  heavy lump  her lap “i don’t think  ever happened before  any one had  take care  two queens asleep  once no not  all  history  england—it couldn’t you know because there never  more than one queen   time do wake up you heavy things” she went    impatient tone but there  no answer but  gentle snoring the snoring got more distinct every minute  sounded more like  tune  last she could even make out  words  she listened so eagerly that when  two great heads vanished  her lap she hardly missed them she  standing before  arched doorway over which   words queen alice  large letters   each side   arch there   bellhandle one  marked “visitors’ bell”   other “servants’ bell” “i’ll wait till  song’s over” thought alice “and then i’ll ring—the—which bell must i ring” she went on very much puzzled   names “i’m not  visitor  i’m not  servant there ought   one marked ‘queen’ you know—” just then  door opened  little way   creature   long beak put  head out   moment  said “no admittance till  week after next”  shut  door again   bang alice knocked  rang  vain   long time but  last  very old frog who  sitting under  tree got up  hobbled slowly towards her   dressed  bright yellow  had enormous boots on “what  it now”  frog said   deep hoarse whisper alice turned round ready  find fault  anybody “where’s  servant whose business    answer  door” she began angrily “which door” said  frog alice almost stamped  irritation   slow drawl  which  spoke “this door  course” the frog looked   door  his large dull eyes   minute then  went nearer  rubbed   his thumb  if   trying whether  paint would come off then  looked  alice “to answer  door”  said “what’s  been asking of” he  so hoarse  alice could scarcely hear him “i don’t know what you mean” she said “i talks english doesn’t i”  frog went on “or  you deaf what did  ask you” “nothing” alice said impatiently “i’ve been knocking  it” “shouldn’t do that—shouldn’t do that—”  frog muttered “vexes it you know” then  went up  gave  door  kick  one  his great feet “you let it alone”  panted out   hobbled back  his tree “and it’ll let you alone you know” at this moment  door  flung open   shrill voice  heard singing “to  lookingglass world   alice  said ‘i’ve  sceptre  hand i’ve  crown  my head let  lookingglass creatures whatever they be come  dine   red queen  white queen  me’” and hundreds  voices joined   chorus “then fill up  glasses  quick  you can and sprinkle  table  buttons  bran put cats   coffee  mice   tea— and welcome queen alice  thirtytimesthree” then followed  confused noise  cheering  alice thought  herself “thirty times three makes ninety i wonder if any one’s counting” in  minute there  silence again   same shrill voice sang another verse “‘o lookingglass creatures’ quoth alice ‘draw near “tis  honour  see me  favour  hear “tis  privilege high  have dinner  tea along   red queen  white queen  me’” then came  chorus again— “then fill up  glasses  treacle  ink or anything else   pleasant  drink mix sand   cider  wool   wine— and welcome queen alice  ninetytimesnine” “ninety times nine” alice repeated  despair “oh that’ll never  done i’d better go   once—”  there   dead silence  moment she appeared alice glanced nervously along  table  she walked up  large hall  noticed  there  about fifty guests  all kinds some  animals some birds  there  even  few flowers among them “i’m glad they’ve come without waiting   asked” she thought “i should never have known who   right people  invite” there  three chairs   head   table  red  white queens had already taken two  them but  middle one  empty alice sat down  it rather uncomfortable   silence  longing  some one  speak at last  red queen began “you’ve missed  soup  fish” she said “put   joint” and  waiters set  leg  mutton before alice who looked   rather anxiously  she had never had  carve  joint before “you look  little shy let me introduce you   leg  mutton” said  red queen “alice—mutton mutton—alice” the leg  mutton got up   dish  made  little bow  alice  alice returned  bow not knowing whether   frightened or amused “may i give you  slice” she said taking up  knife  fork  looking  one queen   other “certainly not”  red queen said very decidedly “it isn’t etiquette  cut any one you’ve been introduced to remove  joint” and  waiters carried  off  brought  large plumpudding   place “i won’t  introduced   pudding please” alice said rather hastily “or we shall get no dinner  all may i give you some” but  red queen looked sulky  growled “pudding—alice alice—pudding remove  pudding”   waiters took  away so quickly  alice couldn’t return  bow however she didn’t see why  red queen should   only one  give orders so   experiment she called out “waiter bring back  pudding”  there   again   moment like  conjuringtrick it  so large  she couldn’t help feeling  little shy  it  she had been   mutton however she conquered her shyness   great effort  cut  slice  handed    red queen “what impertinence” said  pudding “i wonder how you’d like it if i   cut  slice out  you you creature” it spoke   thick suety sort  voice  alice hadn’t  word  say  reply she could only sit  look    gasp “make  remark” said  red queen “it’s ridiculous  leave all  conversation   pudding” “do you know i’ve had such  quantity  poetry repeated  me today” alice began  little frightened  finding that  moment she opened her lips there  dead silence  all eyes  fixed upon her “and it’s  very curious thing i think—every poem  about fishes  some way do you know why they’re so fond  fishes all about here” she spoke   red queen whose answer   little wide   mark “as  fishes” she said very slowly  solemnly putting her mouth close  alice’s ear “her white majesty knows  lovely riddle—all  poetry—all about fishes shall she repeat it” “her red majesty’s very kind  mention it”  white queen murmured into alice’s other ear   voice like  cooing   pigeon “it would  such  treat may i” “please do” alice said very politely the white queen laughed  delight  stroked alice’s cheek then she began “‘first  fish must  caught’ that  easy  baby i think could have caught it ‘next  fish must  bought’ that  easy  penny i think would have bought it ‘now cook me  fish’ that  easy   not take more than  minute ‘let  lie   dish’ that  easy because  already   it ‘bring  here let me sup’ it  easy  set such  dish   table ‘take  dishcover up’ ah   so hard  i fear i’m unable for  holds  like glue— holds  lid   dish while  lies   middle which  easiest  do undishcover  fish or dishcover  riddle” “take  minute  think about it  then guess” said  red queen “meanwhile we’ll drink your health—queen alice’s health” she screamed   top  her voice  all  guests began drinking  directly  very queerly they managed it some  them put their glasses upon their heads like extinguishers  drank all  trickled down their faces—others upset  decanters  drank  wine   ran off  edges   table—and three  them who looked like kangaroos scrambled into  dish  roast mutton  began eagerly lapping up  gravy “just like pigs   trough” thought alice “you ought  return thanks   neat speech”  red queen said frowning  alice  she spoke “we must support you you know”  white queen whispered  alice got up  do it very obediently but  little frightened “thank you very much” she whispered  reply “but i can do quite well without” “that wouldn’t   all  thing”  red queen said very decidedly so alice tried  submit     good grace “and they did push so” she said afterwards when she  telling her sister  history   feast “you would have thought they wanted  squeeze me flat” in fact   rather difficult  her  keep  her place while she made her speech  two queens pushed her so one  each side  they nearly lifted her up into  air “i rise  return thanks—” alice began  she really did rise  she spoke several inches but she got hold   edge   table  managed  pull herself down again “take care  yourself” screamed  white queen seizing alice’s hair  both her hands “something’s going  happen” and then as alice afterwards described it all sorts  things happened   moment the candles all grew up   ceiling looking something like  bed  rushes  fireworks   top as   bottles they each took  pair  plates which they hastily fitted   wings  so  forks  legs went fluttering about  all directions “and very like birds they look” alice thought  herself  well  she could   dreadful confusion   beginning at this moment she heard  hoarse laugh  her side  turned  see what   matter   white queen but instead   queen there   leg  mutton sitting   chair “here i am” cried  voice   soup tureen  alice turned again just  time  see  queen’s broad goodnatured face grinning  her   moment over  edge   tureen before she disappeared into  soup there  not  moment   lost already several   guests  lying down   dishes   soup ladle  walking up  table towards alice’s chair  beckoning  her impatiently  get out   way “i can’t stand this any longer” she cried  she jumped up  seized  tablecloth  both hands one good pull  plates dishes guests  candles came crashing down together   heap   floor “and   you” she went on turning fiercely upon  red queen whom she considered   cause  all  mischief—but  queen  no longer  her side—she had suddenly dwindled down   size   little doll   now   table merrily running round  round after her own shawl which  trailing behind her at any other time alice would have felt surprised  this but she  far too much excited   surprised  anything now “as  you” she repeated catching hold   little creature   very act  jumping over  bottle which had just lighted upon  table “i’ll shake you into  kitten  i will” chapter x shaking she took her off  table  she spoke  shook her backwards  forwards  all her might the red queen made no resistance whatever only her face grew very small  her eyes got large  green  still  alice went  shaking her she kept  growing shorter—and fatter—and softer—and rounder—and— chapter xi waking —and  really was  kitten after all chapter xii which dreamed it “your majesty shouldn’t purr so loud” alice said rubbing her eyes  addressing  kitten respectfully yet  some severity “you woke me out  oh such  nice dream and you’ve been along  me kitty—all through  lookingglass world did you know it dear” it   very inconvenient habit  kittens alice had once made  remark that whatever you say  them they always purr “if they would only purr  ‘yes’  mew  ‘no’ or any rule   sort” she had said “so  one could keep up  conversation but how can you talk   person if they always say  same thing” on this occasion  kitten only purred    impossible  guess whether  meant “yes” or “no” so alice hunted among  chessmen   table till she had found  red queen then she went down  her knees   hearthrug  put  kitten   queen  look  each other “now kitty” she cried clapping her hands triumphantly “confess   what you turned into” “but  wouldn’t look  it” she said when she  explaining  thing afterwards  her sister “it turned away  head  pretended not  see it but  looked  little ashamed  itself so i think  must have been  red queen” “sit up  little more stiffly dear” alice cried   merry laugh “and curtsey while you’re thinking what to—what  purr it saves time remember” and she caught  up  gave  one little kiss “just  honour  having been  red queen” “snowdrop my pet” she went on looking over her shoulder   white kitten which  still patiently undergoing  toilet “when will dinah have finished  your white majesty i wonder that must   reason you  so untidy  my dream—dinah do you know  you’re scrubbing  white queen really it’s most disrespectful  you “and what did dinah turn to i wonder” she prattled on  she settled comfortably down  one elbow   rug  her chin  her hand  watch  kittens “tell me dinah did you turn  humpty dumpty i think you did—however you’d better not mention   your friends just yet  i’m not sure “by  way kitty if only you’d been really  me  my dream there  one thing you would have enjoyed—i had such  quantity  poetry said  me all about fishes tomorrow morning you shall have  real treat all  time you’re eating your breakfast i’ll repeat ‘the walrus   carpenter’  you  then you can make believe it’s oysters dear “now kitty let’s consider who    dreamed  all this   serious question my dear  you should not go  licking your paw like that—as if dinah hadn’t washed you this morning you see kitty  must have been either me or  red king he  part  my dream  course—but then i  part  his dream too was   red king kitty you  his wife my dear so you ought  know—oh kitty do help  settle it i’m sure your paw can wait” but  provoking kitten only began   other paw  pretended  hadn’t heard  question
