slim tower   played  contrasts   large blue air after  had spent  greater part   week  these grave considerations  made up his mind  leave siena but   not content  what  had done  his portfolio siena  eminently sketchable but  had not been industrious on  last morning  his visit   stood staring about him   crowded piazza  feeling that  spite   picturesqueness this   awkward place  setting up  easel  bethought himself  contrast   quiet corner  another part   town which  had chanced upon  one  his first walksan angle   lonely terrace  abutted upon  citywall where three or four superannuated objects seemed  slumber   sunshinethe open door   empty church   faded fresco exposed   air   arch above it   ancient beggarwoman sitting beside    threelegged stool the little terrace had  old polished parapet about  high   man’s breast above which   view  strange sadcolored hills outside   left  wall   town made  outward bend  exposed  rugged  rusty complexion there   smooth stone bench set into  wall   church  which longueville had rested   hour observing  composition   little picture  which i have indicated  elements   which  parapet   terrace would form  foreground the thing  what painters call  subject   had promised himself  come back  his utensils this morning  returned   inn  took possession  them  then  made his way through  labyrinth  empty streets lying   edge   town within  wall like  superfluous folds   garment whose wearer  shrunken  old age he reached his little grassgrown terrace  found   sunny   private  before the old mendicant  mumbling petitions sacred  profane   church door but save  this  stillness  unbroken the yellow sunshine warmed  brown surface   citywall  lighted  hollows   etruscan hills longueville settled himself   empty bench and arranging his little portable apparatus began  ply his brushes he worked  some time smoothly  rapidly   agreeable sense   absence  obstacles it seemed almost  interruption when   silent air  heard  distant bell   town strike noon shortly after this there  another interruption the sound   soft footstep caused him  look up whereupon  saw  young woman standing there  bending her eyes upon  graceful artist a second glance assured him  she   nice girl whom  had seen going into  other inn  her mother  suggested  she had just emerged   little church he suspected howeveri hardly know whythat she had been looking  him  some moments before  perceived her it would perhaps  impertinent  inquire what she thought  him but longueville   space   instant made two or three reflections upon  young lady one  them    effect  she   handsome creature but  she looked rather bold  burden   other  thatyes decidedlyshe   compatriot she turned away almost  soon  she met his eyes  had hardly time  raise his hat as after  moment’s hesitation  proceeded  do she herself appeared  feel  certain hesitation she glanced back   church door  if under  impulse  retrace her steps she stood there  moment longerlong enough  let him see  she   person  easy attitudesand then she walked away slowly   parapet   terrace here she stationed herself leaning her arms upon  high stone ledge presenting her back  longueville  gazing  rural italy longueville went   his sketch but less attentively than before he wondered what this young lady  doing there alone  then  occurred  him  her companionher mother presumablywas   church the two ladies had been   church when  arrived women liked  sit  churches they had been there more than half  hour   mother had not enough   even yet the young lady however  present preferred  view  longueville  painting  became aware  she had placed herself   very centre  his foreground his first feeling   she would spoil it his second   she would improve it little  little she turned more into profile leaning only one arm upon  parapet while  other hand holding her folded parasol hung down  her side she  motionless   almost  if she  standing there  purpose   drawn yes certainly she improved  picture her profile delicate  thin defined itself against  sky   clear shadow   coquettish hat her figure  light she bent  leaned easily she wore  gray dress fastened up   then  fashion  displaying  broad edge   crimson petticoat she kept her position she seemed absorbed   view “is she posingis she attitudinizing  my benefit” longueville asked  himself and then  seemed  him  this   needless assumption   prospect  quite beautiful enough   looked   itself  there  nothing impossible   pretty girl having  love  fine landscape “but posing or not”  went on “i  put her into my sketch she  simply put herself in it  give   human interest there  nothing like having  human interest” so   ready skill   possessed  introduced  young girl’s figure into his foreground    end  ten minutes  had almost made something  had  form   likeness “if she  only  quiet  another ten minutes”  said “the thing  really   picture” unfortunately  young lady  not quiet she had apparently had enough  her attitude  her view she turned away facing longueville again  slowly came back  if  reenter  church to do so she had  pass near him   she approached  instinctively got up holding his drawing  one hand she looked  him again   expression   had mentally characterized  “bold”  few minutes beforewith dark intelligent eyes her hair  dark  dense she   strikingly handsome girl “i am so sorry you moved”  said confidently  english “you  soso beautiful” she stopped looking  him more directly than ever  she looked  his sketch which  held out toward her at  sketch however she only glanced whereas there  observation   eye  she bent upon longueville he never knew whether she had blushed  afterward thought she might have been frightened nevertheless   not exactly terror  appeared  dictate her answer  longueville’s speech “i am much obliged  you don’t you think you have looked  me enough” “by no means i should like so much  finish my drawing” “i am not  professional model” said  young lady “no that ‘s my difficulty” longueville answered laughing “i can’t propose  remunerate you” the young lady seemed  think this joke  indifferent taste she turned away  silence but something  her expression  his feeling   time   situation incited longueville  higher play he felt  lively need  carrying his point “you see    pure kindness”  went on“a simple act  charity five minutes   enough treat me   italian beggar” she had laid down his sketch  had stepped forward he stood there obsequious clasping his hands  smiling his interruptress stopped  looked  him again  if she thought him  very odd person but she seemed amused now  any rate she  not frightened she seemed even disposed  provoke him  little “i wish  go  my mother” she said “where  your mother”  young man asked “in  church  course i did n’t come here alone” “of course not but you may  sure  your mother  very contented i have been   little church it  charming she  just resting there she  probably tired if you  kindly give me five minutes more she  come out  you” “five minutes”  young girl asked “five minutes  do i shall  eternally grateful” longueville  amused  himself   said this he cared infinitely less  his sketch than  words appeared  imply but somehow  cared greatly  this graceful stranger should do what  had proposed the graceful stranger dropped  eye   sketch again “is your picture so good  that” she asked “i have  great deal  talent”  answered laughing “you shall see  yourself when   finished” she turned slowly toward  terrace again “you certainly have  great deal  talent  induce me  do what you ask” and she walked  where she had stood before longueville made  movement  go  her  if  show her  attitude  meant but pointing  decision  his easel she said “you have only five minutes” he immediately went back  his work  she made  vague attempt  take up her position “you must tell me if this  do” she added   moment “it  do beautifully” longueville answered   happy tone looking  her  plying his brush “it  immensely good  you  take so much trouble” for  moment she made no rejoinder but presently she said “of course if i pose  all i wish  pose well” “you pose admirably” said longueville after this she said nothing   several minutes  painted rapidly   silence he felt  certain excitement   movement  his thoughts kept pace    his brush it  very true  she posed admirably she   fine creature  paint her prettiness inspired him  also her audacity    content  regard    moment he wondered about herwho she was  what she wasperceiving   socalled audacity  not vulgar boldness but  play   original  probably interesting character it  obvious  she   perfect lady but   equally obvious  she  irregularly clever longueville’s little figure   successa charming success  thought   put   last touches while   doing this his model’s companion came into view she came out   church pausing  moment  she looked  her daughter   young man   corner   terrace then she walked straight over   young girl she   delicate little gentlewoman   light quick step longueville’s five minutes  up so leaving his place  approached  two ladies sketch  hand the elder one who had passed her hand into her daughter’s arm looked up  him  clear surprised eyes she   charming old woman her eyes  very pretty   either side  them above  pair  fine dark brows   band  silvery hair rather coquettishly arranged “it  my portrait” said her daughter  longueville drew near “this gentleman  been sketching me” “sketching you dearest” murmured her mother “was n’t  rather sudden” “very suddenvery abrupt” exclaimed  young girl   laugh “considering all that  ‘s very good” said longueville offering his picture   elder lady who took   began  examine it “i can’t tell you how much i thank you”  said  his model “it ‘s very well  you  thank me now” she replied “you really had no right  begin” “the temptation  so great” “we should resist temptation and you should have asked my leave” “i  afraid you would refuse it  you stood there just  my line  vision” “you should have asked me  get out  it” “i should have been very sorry besides  would have been extremely rude” the young girl looked  him  moment “yes i think  would but what you have done  ruder” “it   hard case” said longueville “what could i have done then decently” “it ‘s  beautiful drawing” murmured  elder lady handing  thing back  longueville her daughter meanwhile had not even glanced  it “you might have waited till i should go away” this argumentative young person continued longueville shook his head “i never lose opportunities” “you might have sketched me afterwards  memory” longueville looked  her smiling “judge how much better my memory   now” she also smiled  little but instantly became serious “for myself  ‘s  episode i shall try  forget i don’t like  part i have played  it” “may you never play  less becoming one” cried longueville “i hope  your mother  least  accept  memento   occasion” and  turned again  his sketch  her companion who had been listening   girl’s conversation  this enterprising stranger  looking  one   other   air  earnest confusion “won’t you do me  honor  keeping my sketch”  said “i think  really looks like your daughter” “oh thank you thank you i hardly dare” murmured  lady   deprecating gesture “it  serve   kind  amends   liberty i have taken” longueville added   began  remove  drawing   paper block “it makes  worse  you  give   us” said  young girl “oh my dear i am sure  ‘s lovely” exclaimed her mother “it ‘s wonderfully like you” “i think  also makes  worse” longueville   last nettled the young lady’s perversity  perhaps not exactly malignant but   certainly ungracious she seemed  desire  present herself   beautiful tormentress “how does  make  worse”  asked   frown he believed she  clever  she  certainly ready now however she reflected  moment before answering “that you should give us your sketch” she said  last “it   your mother i offered it” longueville observed but this observation  fruit  his irritation appeared  have no effect upon  young girl “is n’t  what painters call  study” she went on “a study   use   painter himself your justification would   you should keep your sketch    might   use  you” “my daughter   study sir you  say” said  elder lady   little light conciliating voice  graciously accepting  drawing again “i  admit” said longueville “that i am very inconsistent set  down  my esteem madam”  added looking   mother “that ‘s  you mamma” said his model disengaging her arm  her mother’s hand  turning away the mamma stood looking   sketch   smile which seemed  express  tender desire  reconcile all accidents “it ‘s extremely beautiful” she murmured “and if you insist  my taking it” “i shall regard    great honor” “very well then  many thanks i  keep it” she looked   young man  moment while her daughter walked away longueville thought her  delightful little person she struck him   sort  transfigured quakeressa mystic   practical side “i am sure you think she ‘s  strange girl” she said “she  extremely pretty” “she  very clever” said  mother “she  wonderfully graceful” “ah but she ‘s good” cried  old lady “i am sure she comes honestly  that” said longueville expressively while his companion returning his salutation   certain scrupulous grace  her own hurried after her daughter longueville remained there staring   view but not especially seeing it he felt  if  had  once enjoyed  lost  opportunity after  while  tried  make  sketch   old beggarwoman who sat there   sort  palsied immobility like  rickety statue   churchdoor but his attempt  reproduce her features  not gratifying   suddenly laid down his brush she  not pretty enoughshe had  bad profile chapter ii two months later bernard longueville   venice still under  impression

rather than hilarity but longueville thought  highly characteristic  his friend what  especially pointed   gordon’s want  imaginationa deficiency which   matter  common jocular allusion between  two young men each  whom kept  collection  acknowledged oddities   playground   other’s wit bernard had often spoken  his comrade’s want  imagination   bottomless pit into which gordon  perpetually inviting him  lower himself “my dear fellow” bernard said “you must really excuse me i cannot take these subterranean excursions i should lose my breath down there i should never come up alive you know i have dropped things downlittle jokes  metaphors little fantasies  paradoxesand i have never heard them touch bottom” this   epigram   part   young man who had  lively play  fancy but   none  less true  gordon wright had  firmlytreading rather than  winged intellect every phrase  his letter seemed  bernard  march  stoutsoled walkingboots  nothing could better express his attachment

difficulty  expressing  when formedof this    little idea    shall have any difficulty  accepting  when expressed” so bernard reflected   rolled   train  munich “gordon’s mind”  went on “has no atmosphere his intellectual process goes    void there  no currents  eddies  affect it no high winds nor hot suns no changes  season  temperature his premises  neatly arranged  his conclusions  perfectly calculable” yet   man  whose character  so freely exercised his wit bernard longueville had  strong affection it  nothing against  validity   friendship   parties   have not  mutual resemblance there must   basis  agreement but  structure reared upon  may contain  thousand disparities these two young men had formed  alliance  old  college days   bond between them had been strengthened   simple fact   having survived  sentimental revolutions  early life its strongest link   sort  mutual respect their tastes their pursuits  different but each  them had  high esteem

unfamiliar   glitter  golden opportunities if i did not shrink  disparaging  constitution  their native land  their own credit i should say   had never been very definitely proposed  these young gentlemen  distinguish themselves on reaching manhood they had each come into property sufficient  make violent exertion superfluous gordon wright indeed had inherited  large estate their wants being tolerably modest they had not been tempted  strive   glory  building up commercial fortunesthe most obvious career open  young americans they had indeed embraced no career  all  if summoned  give

taken  practical shape   had distributed money very freely among  investigating classes after which  had gone  spend  couple  years  germany supposing     land  laboratories here we find him  present

must have  honor  whatever brilliancy attaches   estimation   world  such pursuits it  not indeed  brilliancy  dazzled bernard longueville who however  not easily dazzled  anything it  because  regarded him  so plain  direct  fashion  bernard had  affection  his friendan affection  which  would perhaps  difficult  assign  definite cause personal sympathies  doubtless caused  something but  causes  remote mysterious  our daily vision like those   particular state   weather we content ourselves  remarking    fine or   rains   enjoyment  our likes  dislikes   no means apt  borrow  edge

gordon wright had  tender heart   strong willa combination which when  understanding  not too limited  often  motive  admirable actions there might sometimes   question whether gordon’s understanding  sufficiently unlimited but  impulses   generous temper often play  useful part  filling up  gaps   incomplete imagination   general impression  wright produced  certainly   intelligent goodnature the reasons  appreciating bernard longueville  much more manifest he pleased superficially  well  fundamentally nature had sent him into  world   armful  good gifts he  very goodlookingtall dark agile

combinations  roulette but   not   found  any   gilded chambers among  crowd  pressed  silence about  tables so  bernard presently came  began  wander about  lamplit terrace where innumerable groups seated  strolling made  place  gigantic conversazione it seemed  him very agreeable  amusing   remarked  himself that   man who  supposed not  take especially  epicurean view  life gordon wright  coming  baden had certainly made himself comfortable longueville went his way glancing  one cluster  talkers  another   last  saw  face which brought him   stop he stood  moment looking  it  knew  had

gentleman   saw but nevertheless   instinct  true friendship  recognized  this featureless expanse  robust personality  gordon wright in  moment  had stepped forward  laid his hand upon wright’s

always comes  you  behind  ‘s so awfully fond  surprises” he  laughing   greatly pleased  introduced bernard   two ladies “you must know mrs vivian you must know miss blanche evers” bernard took his place   little circle  wondered whether  ought  venture upon  special recognition  mrs vivian then  seemed  him   should leave  option  this step   lady especially   had detected recognition  her eye but mrs vivian ventured upon nothing special she contented herself  soft generalitieswith remarking  she always liked  know when people would arrive that  herself she never enjoyed surprises “and yet i imagine you have had your share” said longueville   smile he thought this might remind her   moment when she came out   little church  siena  found her daughter posturing   unknown painter but mrs vivian turning her benignant head about gave but  superficial reply “oh i have had my share  everything good  bad i don’t complain  anything” and she gave  little deprecating laugh gordon wright shook

appeared  exchange but few words he himself offered his arm  mrs vivian who paced along   little lightlywavering step making observations upon  beauties  baden   respective merits   hotels chapter iv “which  them  it” asked longueville  his friend after they had bidden goodnight   three ladies   captain lovelock who went off  begin   said  evening they stood when they had turned away   door  mrs vivian’s lodgings   little roughpaved german street “which  them  what” gordon asked staring  his companion “oh come” said longueville “you  not going  begin  play  modesty  this hour did n’t you write  me  you had been making violent love” “violent no” “the more shame  you has your lovemaking been feeble” his friend looked  him  moment rather soberly “i suppose you thought   queer documentthat letter i wrote you” “i thought  characteristic” said longueville smiling “is n’t   same thing” “not   least i have never thought you  man  oddities” gordon stood there looking  him   serious eye half appealing half questioning but  these last words  glanced away even  very modest man may wince  little  hearing himself denied  distinction   few variations   common type longueville made this reflection   struck him also  his companion    graver mood than  had expected though why after all should  have been   state  exhilaration “your letter   very natural interesting one” bernard added “well you see” said gordon facing his companion again “i have been  good deal preoccupied” “obviously my dear fellow” “i want very much  marry” “it ‘s  capital idea” said longueville “i think almost  well  it” his friend declared “as if i had invented it it  struck me   first time” these words  uttered   mild simplicity which provoked longueville  violent laughter “my dear fellow”  exclaimed “you have after all your little oddities” singularly enough however gordon wright failed  appear flattered  this concession “i did n’t send  you  laugh  me”  said “ah but i have n’t travelled three hundred miles  cry seriously solemnly then   one  these young ladies   put marriage into your head” “not  all i had   my head” “having  desire  marry you proceeded  fall  love” “i am not  love” said gordon wright  some energy “ah then my dear fellow why did you send  me” wright looked  him  instant  silence “because i thought you   good fellow  well   clever one” “a good fellow” repeated longueville “i don’t understand your confounded scientific nomenclature but excuse me i won’t laugh i am not  clever fellow but i am  good one” he paused  moment  then laid his hand  his companion’s shoulder “my dear gordon  ‘s no use you   love” “well i don’t want  be” said wright “heavens what  horrible sentiment” “i want  marry  my eyes open i want  know my wife you don’t know people when you   love  them your impressions  colored” “they  supposed  be slightly and you object  color” “well  i say i want  know  woman i marry  i should know any one else i want  see her  clearly” “depend upon it you have too great  appetite  knowledge you set too high  esteem upon  dry light  science” “ah” said gordon promptly “of course i want   fond  her” bernard  spite  his protest began  laugh again “my dear gordon you  better than your theories your passionate heart contradicts your frigid intellect i repeat ityou   love” “please don’t repeat  again” said wright bernard took his arm  they walked along “what shall i call it then you  engaged  making studies  matrimony” “i don’t   least object  your calling  that my studies   extreme interest” “and one  those young ladies   fair volume  contains  precious lesson” said longueville “or perhaps your textbook   two volumes” “no there  one  them i am not studying  all i never could do two things  once” “that proves you   love one can’t   love  two women  once but one may perfectly have two  themor  many  you pleaseup   competitive examination however  i asked you before which  these young ladies    you have selected” gordon wright stopped abruptly eying his friend “which should you say” “ah  ‘s not  fair question” bernard urged “it would  invidious  me  name one rather than  other  if i   mention  wrong one i should feel  if i had been guilty   rudeness towards  other don’t you see” gordon saw perhaps but  held  his idea  making his companion commit himself “never mind  rudeness i  do  same  you some day  make  up which  them should you think me likely  have taken  fancy to on general grounds now  what you know  me” he proposed this problem   animated eye “you forget” his friend said “that though i know thank heaven  good deal  you i know very little  either  those girls i have had too little evidence” “yes but you   man who notices that ‘s why i wanted you  come” “i spoke only  miss evers” “yes i know you have never spoken  miss vivian” gordon wright stood looking  bernard  urging his point   pronounced these words bernard felt peculiarly conscious  his gaze the words represented  illusion

which  added“all  same you noticed her” “oh yes she  very noticeable” “well then” said gordon “you  see i should like you  make  out of course if i am really giving my attention  one   exclusion   other    easy  discover” longueville  half amused half irritated  his friend’s own relish  his little puzzle “‘the exclusion   other’   awkward sound”  answered  they walked on “am i  notice  you  very rude  one   young ladies” “oh dear no do you think there   danger  that” “well” said longueville “i have already guessed” gordon wright remonstrated “don’t guess yetwait  few days i won’t tell you now” “let us see if  does n’t tell me” said bernard privately and  meditated  moment “when i presented myself you  sitting very close  miss evers  talking very earnestly your head  bent toward

after staring  while   sky through  oakboughs “of course  future” said longueville “whenever you make use   personal pronoun feminine i am  understand  miss vivian  indicated” “her name  angela” said gordon “but  course i can scarcely call her that” “it ‘s  beautiful name” longueville rejoined “but i may say  answer  your question  i am not struck   fact  her face corresponds  it” “you don’t think her face beautiful then” “i don’t think  angelic but how can i tell i have only had  glimpse  her” “wait till she looks  you  speakswait till she smiles” said gordon “i don’t think i saw her smileat

moment “i ‘m sure i don’t know” “of course you can’t  interested  that” said bernard smiling “who  captain lovelock” “he   englishman i believe   what ‘s called aristocratically connectedthe younger brother   lord or something   sort” “is   clever man” “i have n’t talked  him much but i doubt it he  rather rakish  plays  great deal” “but   considered here  proof  rakishness” asked bernard “have

bernard gave  long laugh “i am delighted   reasons you give  amusing yourself arithmetical calculations” “i assure you they   real reasons” said gordon blushing  little “that ‘s just  beauty  it you  not afraid  being ‘drawn in’  little miss evers says” “i am never drawn in whatever  thing may be i go in or i stay out but i am not drawn” said gordon wright “you  not drawn into coming  mrs vivian

overmastered i wanted  come  baden” “i have no doubt you did had you become very intimate  your friends  dresden” “i had only seen them three times” “after which you followed them  this place ah don’t

our hero said  himself  all  wished   know what she preferredhe would rigidly conform  it he conformed  her present programme  had ventured  pronounce  word siena  evening before but   careful not  pronounce  again she had her reasons  her own reserve  wondered what they were   gave him  certain pleasure  wonder he enjoyed  consciousness  their having  secret together   became  kind  entertaining suspense  see how long she would continue  keep it for himself    no hurry  let  daylight in  little incident  siena had been  itself  charming affair but miss vivian’s present attitude gave   sort  mystic consecration he thought she carried  off very wellthe theory  she had not seen him before last evening she had been slightly confused but now she   selfpossessed  if  line she had taken   matter  conscience why should    matter  conscience was she  love  gordon wright  did she wish  consequence  forgetand wish him not  suspectthat she had ever received  expression  admiration  another man this  not likely   not likely  least  miss vivian wished  pass   prodigy  innocence  if   admired   pay  tribute  corruption   perfectly obvious  so handsome  girl must have tasted   tree  knowledge as  her being  love  gordon wright   course  another affair  bernard did not pretend  yet  have  opinion  this point beyond hoping very much  she might be he  not wrong   impression  her good looks   had carried away   short interview  siena she had  charmingly chiselled face   free pure outline  clear fair complexion   eyes  hair   dusky beauty her features had  firmness which suggested tranquillity  yet her expression  light  quick  combinationor  contradictionwhich gave  original stamp  her beauty bernard remembered   had thought   trifle “bold” but  now perceived  this had been but  vulgar misreading  her dark direct observant eye the eye   charming one bernard discovered  it little  little all sorts  things  miss vivian was   present simply  handsome intelligent smiling girl he gave her  opportunity  make  allusion  siena  said  her  his friend told him  she  her mother had been spending  winter  italy “oh yes” said angela vivian “we    far south we  five months  sorrento” “and nowhere else” “we spent  few days  rome we usually prefer  quiet places   my mother’s taste” “it  not your mother’s taste then” said bernard “that brought you  baden” she looked  him  moment “you mean  baden  not quiet” longueville glanced about   moving murmuring crowd   lighted windows   conversationhouse   great orchestra perched up   pagoda “this  not my idea  absolute tranquillity” “nor mine either” said miss vivian “i am not fond  absolute tranquillity” “how do you arrange it then  your mother” again she looked  him  moment  her clever slightly mocking smile “as you see by making her come where i wish” “you have  strong will” said bernard “i see that” “no i have simply  weak mother but i make sacrifices too sometimes” “what do you call sacrifices” “well spending  winter  sorrento” bernard began  laugh  then  told her she must have had  very happy life“to call  winter  sorrento  sacrifice” “it depends upon what one gives up” said miss vivian “what did you give up” she touched him  her mocking smile again “that  not  very civil question asked   way” “you mean  i seem  doubt your abnegation” “you seem  insinuate  i had nothing  renounce i gave upi gave up”  she looked about her considering  little“i gave up society” “i am glad you remember what  was” said bernard “if i have seemed uncivil let me make  up when  woman speaks  giving up society what she means  giving up admiration you can never have given up thatyou can never have escaped  it you must have found  even  sorrento” “it may have been there but i never found it it  very respectfulit never expressed itself” “that   deepest kind” said bernard “i prefer  shallower varieties”  young girl answered “well” said bernard “you must remember  although shallow admiration expresses itself all  admiration  expresses itself  not shallow” miss vivian hesitated  moment “some    impertinent” she said looking straight  him rather gravely bernard hesitated about  long “when   impertinent   shallow that comes   same thing” the young girl frowned  little “i am not sure  i understandi am rather stupid but you see how right i am  my taste  such places  this i have  come here  hear such ingenious remarks” “you should add  my coming  well  something  do  it” “everything” said miss vivian “everything does no one else make ingenious remarks does n’t my friend wright” “mr wright says excellent things but i should not exactly call them ingenious remarks” “it  not what wright says  ‘s what  does that ‘s  charm” said bernard his companion  silent   moment “that ‘s not usually  charm good conduct  not thought pleasing” “it surely  not thought  reverse” bernard exclaimed “it does n’t rankin  opinion  most peopleamong  things  make men agreeable” “it depends upon what you call agreeable” “exactly so” said miss vivian “it all depends  that” “but  agreeable” bernard went on“it  n’t after all fortunately such  subtle idea the world certainly  agreed  think  virtue   beautiful thing” miss vivian dropped her eyes  moment  then looking up “is   charm” she asked “for me there  no charm without it” bernard declared “i am afraid   me there is” said  young girl bernard  puzzledhe who  not often puzzled his companion struck him  altogether too clever   likely  indulge   silly affectation  cynicism and yet without this how could one account  her sneering  virtue “you talk  if you had sounded  depths  vice”  said laughing “what do you know about other than virtuous charms” “i know  course nothing about vice but i have known virtue when   very tiresome” “ah then    poor affair it  poor virtue the best virtue  never tiresome” miss vivian looked  him  little  her fine discriminating eye “what  dreadful thing  have  think any virtue poor” this   touching reflection   might have gone further had not  conversation been interrupted  mrs vivian’s appealing  her daughter  aid  defective recollection   story about  spanish family they had met  biarritz  which she had undertaken  entertain gordon wright after this  little circle  joined   party  american friends who  spending  week  baden   conversation became general chapter vii but   following evening bernard again found himself seated  friendly colloquy  this interesting girl while gordon wright discoursed  her mother  one side  little blanche evers chattered   admiring eyes  captain lovelock   other “you  your mother  very kind   little girl” our hero said “you must   great advantage  her” angela vivian directed her eyes  her neighbors  let them rest  while   young girl’s little fidgeting figure  her fresh coquettish face for some moments she said nothing   longueville turning over several things  his mind  watching her  seemed  her glance  one  disfavor he divined  scarcely knew how  her esteem  her pretty companion  small “i don’t know  i am very kind” said miss vivian “i have done nothing  particular  her” “mr wright tells me you came  this place mainly  her account” “i came  myself” said miss vivian “the consideration you speak  perhaps had weight  my mother” “you  not  easy person  say appreciative things to” bernard rejoined “one  tempted  say them but you don’t take them” the young girl colored  she listened  this observation “i don’t think you know” she murmured looking away then “set  down  modesty” she added “that  course  what i have done to what else could one possibly attribute  indifference  compliments” “there  something else one might  proud” “there you  again” bernard exclaimed “you won’t even let me praise your modesty” “i would rather you should rebuke my pride” “that  so humble  speech   leaves no room  rebuke” for  moment miss vivian said nothing “men  singularly base” she declared presently   little smile “they don’t care   least  say things  might help  person they only care  say things  may seem effective  agreeable” “i see you think   say agreeable things   great misdemeanor” “it comes  their vanity” miss vivian went on  if she had not heard him “they wish  appear agreeable  get credit  cleverness  tendresse no matter how silly  would   another person  believe them” bernard   good deal amused   little nettled “women then”  said “have rather  fondness  producing  bad impressionthey like  appear disagreeable” his companion bent her eyes upon her fan   moment  she opened  closed it “they  capable  resigning themselves  itfor  purpose” bernard  moved  extreme merriment “for what purpose” “i don’t know  i mean   purpose” said miss vivian “but   necessity” “ah what  odious necessity” “necessities usually  odious but women meet them men evade them  shirk them” “i contest your proposition women  themselves necessities but they  not odious ones” and bernard added   moment “one could n’t evade them if they were” “i object  being called  necessity” said angela vivian “it diminishes one’s merit” “ah but  enhances  charm  life” “for men doubtless” “the charm  life  very great” bernard went on looking up   dusky hills   summer stars seen through  sort  mist  music  talk   powdery light projected   softly lurid windows   gamingrooms “the charm  life  extreme i am unacquainted  odious necessities i object  nothing” angela vivian looked about her   had donelooked perhaps  moment longer   summer stars  if she had not already proved herself  young lady   contradictory turn  might have been supposed she  just then tacitly admitting  charm  life   considerable “do you suppose miss evers often resigns herself  being disagreeablefor  purpose” asked longueville who had glanced  captain lovelock’s companion again “she can’t  disagreeable she  too gentle too soft” “do you mean too silly” “i don’t know  i call her silly she  not very wise but she  no pretensionsabsolutely noneso  one  not struck  anything incongruous” “what  terrible description i suppose one ought  have  few pretensions” “you see one comes off more easily without them” said miss vivian “do you call  coming off easily” she looked  him  moment gravely “i am very fond  blanche” she said “captain lovelock  rather fond  her” bernard went on the girl assented “he  completely fascinatedhe  very much  love  her” “and do they mean  make  international match” “i hope not my mother  i  greatly troubled” “is n’t   good fellow” “he   good fellow but    mere trifler he  n’t  penny i believe    very expensive habits he gambles  great deal

 new one” “ah well” said bernard “doubtless blanche can take care  herself” for  moment his companion said nothing then she exclaimed “it ‘s what  girl ought   able  do” “i am sure you are” said bernard she met his eyes  she  going  make some rejoinder but before she had time  speak her mother’s little clear conciliatory voice interposed mrs vivian appealed  her daughter  she had done  night before “dear angela what   name   gentleman who delivered  delightful course  lectures  we heard  geneva onwhat   title‘the redeeming features   pagan morality’” angela flushed  little “i have quite forgotten his name mamma” she said without looking round “come  sit  me my dear  we  talk them over i wish mr wright  hear about them” mrs vivian went on “do you wish  convert him  paganism” bernard asked “the lectures  very dull they had no redeeming features” said angela getting up but turning away  her mother she stood looking  bernard longueville  saw she  annoyed  her mother’s interference “every now  then” she said “i take  turn through  gamingrooms the last time captain lovelock went  me will you come tonight” bernard assented  expressive alacrity   charmed  her not wishing  break off her conversation  him “ah we ‘ll all go” said mrs vivian who had been listening  she invited  others  accompany her   kursaal they left their places but angela went first  bernard longueville  her side   idea  her having publicly braved her mother   were   sake  his society lent   moment  almost ecstatic energy  his tread if  had been tempted  presume upon his triumph however  would have found  check   fact   young girl herself tasted very soberly   sweets  defiance she  silent  grave she had  manner which took  edge   wantonness  filial independence yet  all this bernard  pleased  his position and   walked  her through  lighted  crowded rooms where they soon detached themselves  their companions  felt  peculiar satisfaction which best expresses itself  silence angela looked  while   rows  still attentive faces fixed upon  luminous green circle across which little heaps  louis d’or  being pushed   fro  she continued  say nothing then  last she exclaimed simply “come away” they turned away  passed into another chamber  which there  no gambling it   immense apartment apparently  ballroom but  present   quite unoccupied there  green velvet benches all around it   great polished floor stretched away shining   light  chandeliers adorned  innumerable glass drops miss vivian stood  moment   threshold then she passed in  they stopped   middle   place facing each other   their figures reflected  if they had been standing   sheet  ice there  no one   room they  entirely alone “why don’t you recognize me” bernard murmured quickly “recognize you” “why do you seem  forget our meeting  siena” she might have answered if she had answered immediately but she hesitated  while she did so something happened   other end   room which caused her  shift her glance a green velvet portiere suspended  one   doorwaysnot  through which our friends had passedwas lifted  gordon wright stood there holding  up  looking  them his companions  behind him “ah here they are” cried gordon  his loud clear voice this appeared  strike angela vivian   interruption  bernard saw  very much   same light chapter viii he forbore  ask her his question againshe might tell him  her convenience but  days passed by  she never told himshe had her own reasons bernard talked  her very often conversation formed indeed  chief entertainment   quiet little circle  which    member they sat   terrace  talked   mingled starlight  lamplight  they strolled   deep green forests  wound along  side   gentle baden hills under  influence  colloquial tendencies the black forest   country  almost unbroken shade    still days  midsummer  whole place  covered   motionless canopy  verdure our friends  not extravagant or audacious people  they looked  baden life very much   outsidethey sat aloof   brightly lighted drama  professional revelry among themselves  well however  little drama went forward  which each member   company had  part  play bernard longueville had been surprised  first  what  would have called miss vivian’s approachablenessat  frequency  which  encountered opportunities  sitting near her  entering into conversation he had expected  gordon wright would deem himself  have established  anticipatory claim upon  young lady’s attention  that  pursuance  this claim  would occupy  recognized place  her side gordon was after all wooing her   very natural  should seek her society in fact   never very far off but bernard  three or four days had  anomalous consciousness  being still nearer presently however  perceived   owed this privilege simply  his friend’s desire   should become acquainted  miss vivianshould receive  vivid impression   person  whom gordon  so deeply interested after this result might have been supposed   attained gordon wright stepped back into his usual place  showed her those small civilities which   only homage   quiet conditions  their life rendered possiblewalked  her talked  her brought her  book  read  chair  sit upon  couple  flowers  place   bosom  her gown treated her   word   sober but  no means inexpressive gallantry he had not been making violent love   told longueville  these demonstrations  certainly not violent bernard said  himself  if   not   secret  spectator would scarcely make  discovery  gordon cherished  even very safely tended flame angela vivian  her side  not strikingly responsive there  nothing  her deportment  indicate  she   love  her systematic suitor she  perfectly gracious  civil she smiled  his face when  shook hands  her she looked  him  listened when  talked she let him stroll beside her   lichtenthal alley she read or appeared  read  books  lent her  she decorated herself   flowers  offered she seemed neither bored nor embarrassed neither irritated nor oppressed but   bernard’s belief  she took no more pleasure  his attentions than  pretty girl must always take  any recognition  her charms “if she ‘s not indifferent”  said  himself “she is  any rate impartialprofoundly impartial” it  not till  end   week  gordon wright told him exactly how his business stood  miss vivian  what  had reason  expect  hopea week during which their relations had been   happiest  most comfortable cast  during which bernard rejoicing  their long walks  talks   charming weather   beauty  entertainment   place   other things besides had not ceased  congratulate himself  coming  baden bernard after  first day had asked his friend no questions he had  great respect  opportunity coming either  others or  himself   left gordon  turn his lantern  fitfully  might  upon  subject which  tacitly open between them but  which  yet only  mere edges had emerged into light gordon  his side seemed content   moment  having his clever friend under his hand  reserved him  final appeal or  some other mysterious use “you can’t tell me you don’t know her now”  said one evening   two young men strolled along  lichtenthal alley“now  you have had  whole week’s observation  her” “what   week’s observation   singularly clever  complicated woman” bernard asked “ah your week  been  some use you have found out she  complicated” gordon rejoined “my dear gordon” longueville exclaimed “i don’t see what  signifies  you  i should find miss vivian out when  man ‘s  love what need  care what other people think   loved object” “it would certainly   pity  care too much but there  some excuse  him   loved object being  you say complicated” “nonsense that ‘s no excuse the loved object  always complicated” gordon walked   silence  moment “well then i don’t care  button what you think” “bravo that ‘s  way  man should talk” cried longueville gordon indulged  another fit  meditation  then  said “now  leaves you  liberty  say what you please” “ah my dear fellow you  ridiculous” said bernard “that ‘s precisely what i want you  say you always think me too reasonable” “well i go back  my first assertion i don’t know miss viviani mean i don’t know her  have opinions about her i don’t suppose you wish me  string you off  dozen mere banalites‘she ‘s  charming girlevidently  superior personhas  great deal  style’” “oh no” said gordon “i know all that but  any rate”  added “you like her eh” “i do more” said longueville “i admire her” “is  doing more” asked gordon reflectively “well  greater whichever  is includes  less” “you won’t commit yourself” said gordon “my dear bernard”  added “i thought you knew such  immense deal about women” gordon wright   so kindly  candid  nature    hardly conceivable  this remark should have been framed  make bernard commit himself  putting him  his mettle such  view would imply indeed  gordon’s part  greater familiarity   uses  irony than  had ever possessed  well   livelier conviction   irritable nature  his friend’s vanity in fact however  may  confided   reader  bernard  pricked   tender place though  resentment  vanity  not visible  his answer “you  quite wrong”  simply said “i am  ignorant  women   monk  his cloister” “you try  prove too much you don’t think her sympathetic” and  regards this last remark gordon wright must  credited   certain ironical impulse bernard stopped impatiently “i ask you again what does  matter  you what i think  her” “it matters  this sensethat she  refused me” “refused you then   all over  nothing matters” “no   n’t over” said gordon   positive headshake “don’t you see   n’t over” bernard smiled laid his hand  his friend’s shoulder  patted   little “your attitude might almost pass    resignation” “i ‘m not resigned” said gordon wright “of course not but when  you refused” gordon stood  minute  his eyes fixed   ground then  last looking up “three weeks agoa fortnight before you came but let us walk along”  said “and i  tell you all about it” “i proposed  her three weeks ago” said gordon  they walked along “my heart  very much set upon it i  very hard hiti  deeply smitten she had been very kind  meshe had been charmingi thought she liked me then i thought her mother  pleased  would have liked it mrs vivian  fact told me  much   course i spoke  her first well angela does like meor  least she didand i see no reason  suppose she  changed only she did n’t like me enough she said  friendliest  pleasantest things  me but she thought  she knew me too little   i knew her even less she made  great point  thatthat i had no right  yet  trust her i told her  if she would trust me i  perfectly willing  trust her but she answered  this  poor reasoning she said  i  trustworthy   she  not andin short all sorts  nonsense she abused herself roundlyaccused herself  no end  defects” “what defects  instance” “oh i have n’t remembered them she said she had  bad temperthat she led her mother  dreadful life now poor mrs vivian says she   angel” “ah yes” bernard observed “mrs vivian says that very freely” “angela declared  she  jealous ungenerous unforgivingall sorts  things i remember she said ‘i am very false’  i think she remarked  she  cruel” “but this did n’t put you off” said bernard “not  all she  making up” “she makes up very well” bernard exclaimed laughing “do you call  well” “i mean   very clever” “it  not clever   point  view  wishing  discourage me” “possibly but i am sure” said bernard “that if i had been present  your interviewexcuse  impudence   hypothesisi should have been struck   young lady’s”   paused  moment “with her what” “with her ability” “well her ability  not sufficient  induce me  give up my idea she told me  after i had known her six months i should detest her” “i have no doubt she could make you do  if she should try that ‘s what i mean  her ability” “she calls herself cruel” said gordon “but she  not had  cruelty  try she  been very reasonableshe  been perfect i agreed  her  i would drop  subject   while   meanwhile we should  good friends we should take time  know each other better  act  accordance  further knowledge there  no hurry since we trusted each otherwrong  my trust might be she had no wish  i should go away i  not   least disagreeable  her she liked me extremely  i  perfectly free  try  please her only i should drop my proposal   free  take  up again or leave  alone later  i should choose if she felt differently then i should have  benefit  it  if i myself felt differently i should also have  benefit  it” “that ‘s  very comfortable arrangement and  ‘s your present situation” asked bernard gordon hesitated  moment “more or less but not exactly” “miss vivian feels differently” said bernard “not  i know of” gordon’s companion   laugh clapped him   shoulder again “admirable youth you   capital match” “are you alluding  my money” “to your money   your modesty there   much  one    otherwhich  saying  great deal” “well” said gordon “in spite   enviable combination i am not happy” “i thought you seemed pensive” bernard exclaimed “it ‘s you then who feel differently” gordon gave  sigh “to say    say too much” “what shall we say then” his companion asked kindly gordon stopped again  stood there looking up   certain particularly lustrous star which twinkledthe night  cloudyin  open patch  sky   vague brightness shone down  his honest  serious visage “i don’t understand her”  said “oh i ‘ll say   you any day” cried bernard “i can’t help you there” “you must help me”  gordon wright deserted his star “you must keep me  good humor” “please  walk on then i don’t   least pity you she  very charming  you” “true enough but insisting    not  way  keep me  good humorwhen i feel  i do” “how   you feel” “puzzled  deathbewildereddepressed” this  but  beginning  gordon wright’s list  went   say  though  “thought  highly”  miss vivian   had ever done  felt less  his ease  her than   first weeks  their acquaintance  this condition made him uncomfortable  unhappy “i don’t know what ‘s  matter” said poor gordon “i don’t know what  come between us it  n’t her faulti don’t make her responsible  it i began  notice  about  fortnight agobefore you came shortly after  talk i had  her  i have just described  you her manner  n’t changed  i have no reason  suppose  she likes me any  less but she makes  strange impression  meshe makes me uneasy it ‘s only her nature coming out i supposewhat you might call her originality she ‘s thoroughly originalshe ‘s  kind  mysterious creature i suppose  what i feel   sort  fascination but   just what i don’t like hang it i don’t want   fascinatedi object  being fascinated” this little story had taken some time   telling so   two young men had now reached their hotel “ah my dear gordon” said bernard “we speak  different language if you don’t want   fascinated what  one  say  you ‘object  being fascinated’ there ‘s  man easy  satisfy raffine va” “well see here now” said gordon stopping   doorway   inn “when  comes   point do you like  yourself” “when  comes   point” bernard exclaimed “i assure you i don’t wait till then i like  beginningi delight   approach  iti revel   prospect” “that’s just what i did but now   thing  comei don’t revel to  fascinated    mystified damn it i like my libertyi like my judgment” “so do ilike yours” said bernard laughing  they took their bedroom candles chapter ix bernard talked  this matter rather theoretically inasmuch   his own sense     state neither  incipient nor  absorbed fascination he got  very easily however  angela vivian  felt none   mysterious discomfort alluded   his friend the element  mystery attached itself rather   young lady’s mother who gave him  impression   undiscoverable reasons she avoided his society he regretted her evasive deportment   found something agreeable  this shy  scrupulous little woman who struck him   curious specimen   society  which  had once been very fond he learned  she   old new england stock but  had not needed this information  perceive  mrs vivian  animated   genius  boston “she   boston temperament”  said using  phrase  which  had become familiar  which evoked  train  associations but then  immediately added  if mrs vivian   daughter   puritans  puritan strain  her disposition had been mingled  another element “it   boston temperament sophisticated”  said “perverted  littleperhaps even corrupted it   local eastwind   infusion  climates less tonic” it seemed  him  mrs vivian   puritan grown worldlya bostonian relaxed  this impression oddly enough contributed  his wish  know more  her he felt like going up  her very politely  saying “dear lady  most honored compatriot what   world have i done  displease you you don’t approve  me  i am dying  know  reason why i should  so happy  exert myself   agreeable  you it ‘s no use you give me  cold shoulder when i speak  you you look  other way   only when i speak  your daughter  you look  me it  true   those times you look  me very hard  if i am not greatly mistaken you  not gratified  what you see you count  words i address  your beautiful angelayou time our harmless little interviews you interrupt them indeed whenever you can you call her awayyou appeal  her you cut across  conversation you  always laying plots  keep us apart why can’t you leave me alone i assure you i am  most innocent  men your beautiful angela can’t possibly  injured  my conversation  i have no designs whatever upon her peace  mind what  earth have i done  offend you” these observations bernard longueville  disposed  make  one afternoon  opportunity offering they rose  his lips  came very near passing them in fact however   last moment his eloquence took another turn it   custom   orchestra   kursaal  play   afternoon    music  often good  great many people assembled under  trees  three o’clock  listen  it this  not   regular thing  hour  reunion   little group  which we  especially interested miss vivian  particular unless  excursion  some sort had been agreed upon  day before  usually not   seen   precincts   conversationhouse until  evening bernard one afternoon  three o’clock directed his steps  this small worldcentre  baden and passing along  terrace soon encountered little blanche evers strolling there under  pink parasol  accompanied  captain lovelock this young lady  always extremely sociable   quite  accordance  her habitual geniality  she should stop  say how d’ ye do  our hero “mr longueville  growing very frivolous” she said “coming   kursaal  all sorts  hours” “there  nothing frivolous  coming here   hope  finding you”  young man answered “that  very serious” “it would  more serious  lose miss evers than  find her” remarked captain lovelock  gallant jocosity “i wish you would lose me” cried  young girl “i think i should like   lost i might have all kinds  adventures” “i ‘guess’ so” said captain lovelock hilariously “oh i should find my way i can take care  myself” blanche went on “mrs vivian does n’t think so” said bernard who had just perceived this lady seated under  tree   book over  top  which she  observing her pretty protege blanche looked toward her  gave her  little nod   smile then chattering    young men “she ‘s awfully careful i never saw any one so careful but i suppose she  right she promised my mother she would  tremendously particular but i don’t know what she thinks i would do” “that  n’t flattering  me” said captain lovelock “mrs vivian does n’t approve  meshe wishes me  jamaica what does she think me capable of” “and me now” bernard asked “she likes me least  all  i  my side think she ‘s so nice” “can’t say i ‘m very sweet  her” said  captain “she strikes me  feline” blanche evers gave  little cry  horror “stop sir this instant i won’t have you talk  way about  lady who  been so kind  me” “she  n’t so kind  you she would like  lock you up where i can never see you” “i ‘m sure i should n’t mind that” cried  young girl   little laugh   toss  her head “mrs vivian   most perfect characterthat ‘s why my mother wanted me  come  her and if she promised my mother she would  careful  n’t she right  keep her promise she ‘s  great deal more careful than mamma ever was   ‘s just what mamma wanted she would never take  trouble herself and then she  always scolding me mrs vivian never scolds me she only watches me but i don’t mind that” “i wish she would watch you  little less  scold you  little more” said captain lovelock “i have no doubt you wish  great many horrid things” his companion rejoined  delightful asperity “ah unfortunately i never have anything i wish” sighed lovelock “your wishes must  comprehensive” said bernard “it seems  me you have  good deal” the englishman gave  shrug “it ‘s less than you might think she  watching us more furiously than ever”  added   moment looking  mrs vivian “mr gordon wright   only man she likes she  awfully fond  mr gordon wright” “ah mrs vivian shows her wisdom” said bernard “he  certainly very handsome” murmured blanche evers glancing several times   very pretty aggressiveness  captain lovelock “i must say i like mr gordon wright why   world did you come here without him” she went on addressing herself  bernard “you two  so awfully inseparable i don’t think i ever saw you alone before” “oh i have often seen mr gordon wright alone” said captain lovelock“that is alone  miss vivian that ‘s what  old lady likes she can’t have too much  that” the young girl poised   instant  one  her pretty attitudes looked  him  head  foot “well i call  scandalous do you mean  she wants  make  match” “i mean   young man  six thousand  year” “it ‘s no matter what  hassix thousand  year  n’t much and we don’t do things   way  our country we have n’t those horrid matchmaking arrangements  you have  your dreadful country american mothers  not like english mothers” “oh any one can see  course” said captain lovelock “that mr gordon wright  dying  love  miss vivian” “i can’t see it” cried blanche “he dies easier than i eh” “i wish you would die” said blanche “at any rate angela  not dying  love  mr wright” “well she  marry him all  same” lovelock declared blanche evers glanced  bernard “why don’t you contradict that” she asked “why don’t you speak up  your friend” “i am quite ready  speak  my friend” said bernard “but i am not ready  speak  miss vivian” “well i am” blanche declared “she won’t marry him” “if she does n’t i ‘ll eat my hat” said captain lovelock “what do you mean”  went on “by saying   america  pretty girl’s mother does n’t care   young fellow’s property” “well they don’twe consider  dreadful why don’t you say so mr longueville” blanche demanded “i never saw any one take things so quietly have n’t you got any patriotism” “my patriotism  modified   indisposition  generalize” said bernard laughing “on this point permit me not  generalize i am interested   particular casein ascertaining whether mrs vivian thinks very often  gordon wright’s income” miss evers gave  little toss  disgust “if you  so awfully impartial you had better go  ask her” “that ‘s  good ideai think i  go  ask her” said bernard captain lovelock returned  his argument “do you mean  say  your mother would  indifferent   fact  i have n’t  shilling   world” “indifferent” blanche demanded “oh no she would  sorry  you she  very charitableshe would give you  shilling” “she would n’t let you marry me” said lovelock “she would n’t have much trouble  prevent it” cried  young girl bernard had had enough  this intellectual fencing “yes i  go  ask mrs vivian”  repeated and  left his companions  resume their walk chapter x it had seemed  him  good idea  interrogate mrs vivian but there   great many good ideas   never put into execution as  approached her   smile   salutation and   air  asking leave  take  liberty seated himself   empty chair beside her  felt  humorous relish  her own probable dismay which relaxed  investigating impulse his impulse  now simply  prove  her     most unobjectionable fellow   worlda proposition which resolved itself into several ingenious observations upon  weather  music  charms   drawbacks  baden  merits   volume  she held  her lap if mrs vivian should  annoyed should  fluttered bernard would feel very sorry  her there  nothing   world   respected more than  moral consciousness   little boston woman whose view  life  serious  whose imagination  subject  alarms he held     temple  delicacy where one should walk  tiptoe   wished  exhibit  mrs vivian  possible lightness  his own step she herself  incapable  being rude or ungracious  now  she  fairly confronted   plausible object  her mistrust she composed herself  her usual attitude  refined liberality her book   volume  victor cousin “you must have  extraordinary power  abstracting your mind” bernard said  her observing it “studying philosophy   baden kursaal strikes me   real intellectual feat” “don’t you think we need  little philosophy here” “by all meanswhat we bring  us but i should n’t attempt  use   textbook   spot” “you should n’t speak  yourself  if you  not clever” said mrs vivian “every one says you  so very clever” longueville stared there   unexpectedness   speech   incongruity  mrs vivian’s beginning  flatter him he needed  remind himself  if she   bostonian she   bostonian perverted “ah my dear madam every one  no one”  said laughing “it  mr wright  particular” she rejoined “he  always told us that” “he  blinded  friendship” “ah yes we know about your friendship” said mrs vivian “he  told us about that” “you  making him out  terrible talker” “we think  talks so wellwe  so very fond  his conversation” “it ‘s usually excellent” said bernard “but  depends  good deal   subject” “oh” rejoined mrs vivian “we always let him choose his subjects” and dropping her eyes  if  sudden reflection she began  smooth down  crumpled corner  her volume it occurred  bernard thatby some mysterious impulseshe  suddenly presenting him   chance  ask her  question  blanche evers had just suggested two or three other things  well occurred  him captain lovelock had been struck   fact  she favored gordon wright’s addresses  her daughter  captain lovelock had  grotesque theory  she had set her heart upon seeing this young lady come into six thousand  year miss evers’s devoted swain had never struck bernard   brilliant reasoner but our friend suddenly found himself regarding him  one   inspired the form  depravity into which  new england conscience had lapsed  mrs vivian’s part   undue appreciation   possible soninlaw’s income in this illuminating discovery everything else became clear mrs vivian disliked her humble servant because  had not thirty thousand dollars  year  because   moment when   angela’s prime duty  concentrate her thoughts upon gordon wright’s great advantages  clever young man  paltry fortune   superfluous diversion “when you say clever everything  relative”  presently observed “now there  captain lovelock    certain kind  cleverness   very observant” mrs vivian glanced up   preoccupied air “we don’t like captain lovelock” she said “i have heard him say capital things” bernard answered “we think him brutal” said mrs vivian “please don’t praise captain lovelock” “oh i only want   just” mrs vivian   moment said nothing “do you want very much   just” she presently asked “it ‘s my most ardent desire” “i ‘m glad  hear thatand i can easily believe it” said mrs vivian bernard gave her  grateful smile but while  smiled  asked himself  serious question “why  deuce does she go  flattering meyou have always been very kind  me”  said aloud “it ‘s  mr wright’s account” she answered demurely in speaking  words i have just quoted bernard longueville had felt himself   certain compunction   skirting  edge  clever impudence but mrs vivian’s quiet little reply suggested  him  her cleverness if not her impudence  almost equal  his own he remarked  himself   had not yet done her justice “you bring everything back  gordon wright”  said continuing  smile mrs vivian blushed  little “it  because   really   foundation  everything   pleasant  us here when we first came we had some very disagreeable rooms   soon   arrived  found us some excellent onesthat  less expensive and then mr longueville” she added   soft sweet emphasis which should properly have contradicted  idea  audacity but which  bernard’s awakened sense seemed really  impart  vivid color  it “he  also  cause  your joining our little party” “oh among his services  should never  forgotten you should set up  tablet  commemorate it   wall   kursaalthe wicked little woman” bernard mentally subjoined mrs vivian appeared quite unruffled  his sportive sarcasm  she continued  enumerate her obligations  gordon wright “there  so many ways  which  gentleman can   assistance  three poor lonely women especially when     same time so friendly  so delicate  mr wright i don’t know what we should have done without him  i feel  if every one ought  know it he seems like  very old friend my daughter  i quite worship him i  not conceal  you  when i saw you coming through  grounds  short time ago without him i  very much disappointed i hope   not ill” bernard sat listening  his eyes   ground “oh no   simply  home writing letters” mrs vivian  silent  moment “i suppose    very large correspondence” “i really don’t know just now  i am  him    smaller one than usual” “ah yes when you  separated i suppose you write volumes  each other but  must have  great many business letters” “it  very likely” said bernard “and if  has you may  sure  writes them” “order  method” mrs vivian exclaimed “with his immense property those virtues  necessary” bernard glanced  her  moment “my dear lovelock”  said  himself “you  not such  fool  you seemgordon’s virtues  always necessary doubtless”  went on “but should you say his property  immense” mrs vivian made  delicate little movement  deprecation “oh don’t ask me  say i know nothing about it i only supposed   rich” “he  rich but   not  croesus” “oh you fashionable young men have  standard  luxury” said mrs vivian   little laugh “to  povertystricken widow such  fortune  mr wright’s seems magnificent” “don’t call me such horrible names” exclaimed bernard “our friend  certainly money enough   spare” “that  all i meant he once had occasion  allude  his property but   so modest so reserved   tone  took about it  one hardly knew what  think” “he  ashamed  being rich” said bernard “he would  sure  represent everything unfavorably” “that ‘s just what i thought” this ejaculation  more eager than mrs vivian might have intended but even had  been less so bernard    mood  appreciate it “i felt  we should make allowances  his modesty but    very good taste” mrs vivian added “he ‘s  fortunate man” said bernard “he gets credit  his good tasteand  gets credit   full figure  his income  well” “ah” murmured mrs vivian rising lightly  if  make her words appear more casual “i don’t know  full figure  his income” she  turning away  bernard   raised his hat  separated  her felt    rather cruel   should let her go without enlightening her ignorance but  said  himself  she knew quite enough indeed  took  walk along  lichtenthal alley  carried out this line  reflection whether or no miss vivian   love  gordon wright her mother  enamored  gordon’s fortune   had suddenly occurred  her  instead  treating  friend  her daughter’s suitor  civil mistrust she would help her case better  giving him  hint  her state  mind  appealing  his sense  propriety nothing could  more natural than  mrs vivian should suppose  bernard desired his friend’s success for  our thoughtful hero said  himself what she had hitherto taken  into her head  fear  not  bernard should fall  love  her daughter but  her daughter should fall

“you  stay here then i am so glad  that” “i  taking   granted but  reflectionwhat do you recommend” “i recommend you  stay” “my dear fellow your word  law” said bernard “i want you  take care  those ladies” his friend went on “i don’t like  leave them alone” “you  joking” cried bernard “when did you ever hear  my ‘taking care’  any one it ‘s  much  i can do  take care  myself” “this  very easy” said gordon “i simply want  feel  they have  man about them” “they  have  man  any ratethey have  devoted lovelock” “that ‘s just why i want them  have another he  only  eye  miss evers who   way  extremely bored  him you look after  others you have made yourself very agreeable  them  they like you extremely” “ah” said bernard laughing “if you  going   coarse  flattering i collapse if you  going  titillate my vanity i succumb” “it won’t  so disagreeable” gordon observed   intention vaguely humorous “oh no  won’t  disagreeable i  go  mrs vivian every morning hat  hand  my orders” gordon wright  his hands  his pockets   meditative expression took several turns about  room “it    capital chance”  said  last stopping  front  his companion “a chance  what” “a chance  arrive   conclusion about my young friend” bernard gave  gentle groan “are you coming back  that did n’t i arrive   conclusion long ago did n’t i tell you she   delightful girl” “do you call   conclusion the first comer could tell me    end   hour” “do you want me  invent something different” bernard asked “i can’t invent anything better” “i don’t want you  invent anything i only want you  observe herto study her  complete independence you  have her  yourselfmy absence  leave you  liberty hang it sir” gordon declared “i should think you would like it” “damn it sir you ‘re delicious” bernard answered   broke into  irrepressible laugh “i don’t suppose  ‘s  my pleasure  you suggest  arrangement” gordon took  turn about  room again “no  ‘s  mine at least  ‘s  my benefit” “for your benefit” “i have got all sorts  ideasi told you  other day they  all mixed up together  i want  fresh impression” “my impressions  never fresh” bernard replied “they would  if you had  little goodwillif you entered  little into my dilemma” the note  reproach  so distinct  these words  bernard stood staring “you never take anything seriously” his companion went on bernard tried  answer  seriously  possible “your dilemma seems  me  all dilemmas  strangest” “that may be but different people take things differently don’t you see” gordon went    sudden outbreak  passion“don’t you see  i am horribly divided  mind i care immensely  angela vivianand yetand yeti am afraid  her” “afraid  her” “i am afraid she ‘s cleverer than ithat she would   difficult wife  she might do strange things” “what sort  things” “well  she might flirt  instance” “that ‘s not  thing   man  fear” “not when  supposes his wife   fond  himno but i don’t suppose thati have given  up if i should induce angela vivian  accept me she would do   grounds purely reasonable she would think  best simply that would give her  chance  repent” bernard sat  some time looking  his friend “you say she  cleverer than you it ‘s impossible   cleverer than you” “oh come longueville” said gordon angrily “i am speaking very seriously you have done  remarkably clever thing you have impressed me   reality  withwhat shall i term itthe estimable character  what you call your dilemma now this fresh impression  minewhat do you propose  do   when you get it” “such things  always useful it    good thing  have” “i am much obliged  you but do you propose  let anything depend upon it do you propose  take or  leave miss vivianthat is  return   charge or  give up tryingin consequence  my fresh impression” gordon seemed perfectly unembarrassed  this question  spite   ironical light which  projected upon his sentimental perplexity “i propose  do what i choose”  said “that ‘s  relief  me” bernard rejoined “this idea  yours is after all only  play   scientific mind” “i shall contradict you flat if i choose” gordon went on “ah  ‘s well  warn me  that” said bernard laughing “even  most sincere judgment   world likes   notified  little   danger

questioned him eagerly    whereabouts  mrs vivian “gad i believe they ‘ve left  placeleft  place without giving  fellow warning” cried lovelock “oh no i think they  here still” said bernard “my friend

vivian’s little sittingroom  paying  second visit on this occasion  two other ladies   home  bernard  not exclusively indebted  miss evers  entertainment it   this source  hospitality however  lovelock mainly appealed following  young girl out upon  little balcony   suspended above  confectioner’s window mrs vivian sat writing  one   windows   sittingroom  bernard addressed his conversation  angela “wright requested me  keep  eye  you”  said “but you seem very much inclined  keep out  my jurisdiction” “i supposed you had gone away” she answered“now  your friend  gone” “by no means gordon   charming fellow but    no means  only attraction  baden besides i have promised him  look after youto take care  you” the girl looked  him  moment  silencea little askance “i thought you had probably undertaken something   sort” she presently said “it   course  very natural request  gordon  make” angela got up  turned away she wandered about  room  went  stood  one   windows bernard found  movement abrupt  not particularly gracious but  young man  not easy  snub he followed her  they stood   second windowthe long window  opened upon  balcony miss evers  captain lovelock  leaning   railing looking into  street  apparently amusing themselves highly  what they saw “i am not sure    natural request  him  make” said angela “what could have been more sodevoted     you” she hesitated  moment then   little laugh “he ought  have locked us up  said nothing about it” “it ‘s not so easy  lock you up” said bernard “i know wright  great influence  you but you  after all independent beings” “i am not  independent being if my mother  mr wright   agree together  put me out  harm’s way they could easily manage it” “you seem  have been trying something   sort” said bernard “you have been so terribly invisible” “it  because i thought you had designs upon us  you  watching  usto take care  us” “you contradict yourself you said just now  you believed i had left baden” “that   artificiala conventional speech is n’t  lady always supposed  say something   sort   visitor  way  pretending  have noticed  she  not seen him” “you know i would never have left baden without coming  bid you goodbye” said bernard the girl made no rejoinder she stood looking out   little sunny slanting roughpaved german street “are you taking care  us now” she asked   moment “has  operation begun have you heard  news mamma” she went on “do you know  mr wright  made us over  mr longueville   kept till called for suppose mr wright should never call  us” mrs vivian left her writingtable  came toward bernard smiling  him  pressing her hands together “there  no fear  that i think” she said “i am sure i am very glad we have  gentleman near us i think you    very good caretaker mr longueville  i recommend my daughter  put great faith  your judgment” and mrs vivian gave him  intensea pleading almost affectinglittle smile “i am greatly touched  your confidence  i shall do everything i can think   merit it” said  young man “ah mamma’s confidence  wonderful” angela exclaimed “there  never anything like mamma’s confidence i am very different i have no confidence and then i don’t like being deposited like  parcel or being watched like  curious animal i am too fond  my liberty” “that   second time you have contradicted yourself” said bernard “you said just now  you  not  independent being” angela turned toward him quickly smiling  frowning  once “you do watch one certainly i see   already begun” mrs vivian laid her hand upon her daughter’s   little murmur  tender deprecation   girl bent over  kissed her “mamma  tell you  ‘s  effect  agitation” she said“that i am nervous  don’t know what i say i am supposed   agitated  mr wright’s departure  n’t  it mamma” mrs vivian turned away   certain soft severity “i don’t know my daughter i don’t understand you” a charming pink flush had come into angela’s cheek   noticeable light into her eye she looked admirably handsome  bernard frankly gazed  her she met his gaze  instant  then she went on “mr longueville does n’t understand me either you must know  i am agitated” she continued “every now  then i have moments  talking nonsense it ‘s  air  baden i think  ‘s too exciting it ‘s only lately i have been so when you go away i shall  horribly ashamed” “if  air  baden  such  effect upon you” said bernard “it  only  proof  more  you need  solicitous attention  your friends” “that may be but  i told you just now i have no confidencenone whatever  any one or anything therefore   present i shall withdraw   worldi shall seclude myself let us go  being quiet mamma three or four days   have been so charming let  parcel lie till  ‘s called for it  much safer  should n’t  touched  all i shall assume that metaphorically speaking mr wright who  you have intimated  our earthly providence  turned  key upon us i am locked up i shall not go out except upon  balcony” and  this angela stepped out   long window  went  stood beside miss evers bernard  extremely amused but   also  good deal puzzled   came over him    not  wonder  poor wright should not have found this young lady’s disposition  perfectly decipherable page he remained   room  mrs vivianhe stood there looking  her  his agreeably mystified smile she had turned away but  perceiving  her daughter had gone outside she came toward bernard again  her habitual little air  eagerness mitigated  discretion there instantly rose before his mind  vision   moment when  had stood face  face  this same apologetic mamma after angela had turned her back   grassgrown terrace  siena to make  vision complete mrs vivian took  into her head  utter  same words “i am sure you think she   strange girl” bernard recognized them   gave  light laugh “you told me   first time you ever saw mein  quiet little corner   italian town” mrs vivian gave  little faded elderly blush “don’t speak  that” she murmured glancing   open window “it   little accident  travel” “i am dying  speak  it” said bernard “it  such  charming accident  me tell me this  leasthave you kept my sketch” mrs vivian colored more deeply  glanced   window again “no” she just whispered bernard looked out   window too angela  leaning against  railing   balcony  profile just  she had stood while  painted her against  polished parapet  siena the young man’s eyes rested  her  moment then   glanced back  her mother “has she kept it”  asked “i don’t know” said mrs vivian  decision the decision  excessiveit expressed  poor lady’s distress  having her veracity tested “dear little daughter   puritansshe can’t tell  fib” bernard exclaimed  himself and  this flattering conclusion  took leave  her chapter xii it  affirmed   early stage  this narrative     young man   contemplative  speculative turn   had perhaps never been more true  his character than during  hour or two  evening   sat  himself   terrace   conversationhouse surrounded   crowd   frequenters but lost  his meditations the place  full

luxury   clever man it played  present over  whole field  angela vivian’s oddities  conductfor since his visit   afternoon bernard had felt   spectacle  considerably enlarged he had come  feel also  poor gordon’s predicament   no means  unnatural one longueville had begun  take his friend’s dilemma very seriously indeed the girl  certainly  curious study the evening drew   close   crowd  bernard’s fellowloungers dispersed the lighted windows   kursaal still glittered   bosky darkness   lamps along  terrace had not been extinguished but  great promenade  almost deserted here  there only  lingering couplethe red tip   cigar   vague radiance   light dressgave animation   place but bernard sat there still  his tilted chair beneath his orangetree his imagination had wandered very far    awaiting  return   fold he    point  rising however when  saw three figures come down  empty vista   terracefigures which even   distance had  familiar air he immediately left his seat and taking  dozen steps recognized angela vivian blanche evers  captain lovelock in  moment  met them   middle   terrace blanche immediately announced  they had come   midnight walk “and if you think  ‘s improper” she exclaimed “it ‘s not my inventionit ‘s miss vivian’s” “i beg pardonit ‘s mine” said captain lovelock “i desire  credit  it i started  idea you never would have come without me” “i think  would have been more proper  come without you than  you” blanche declared “you know you ‘re  dreadful character” “i ‘m much worse when i ‘m away  you than when i ‘m  you” said lovelock “you keep me  order” the young girl gave  little cry “i don’t know what you call order you can’t  worse than you have been tonight” angela  not listening  this she turned away  little looking about   empty garden “this   third time today  you have contradicted yourself”  said though  spoke softly  went nearer  her but she appeared not  hear himshe looked away “you ought  have been there mr longueville” blanche went on “we have had  most lovely night we sat all  evening  mrs vivian’s balcony eating ices to sit   balcony eating icesthat ‘s my idea  heaven” “with  angel  your side” said captain lovelock “you  not my idea   angel” retorted blanche “i ‘m afraid you ‘ll never learn what  angels  really like” said  captain “that ‘s why miss evers got mrs vivian  take rooms over  baker’sso  she could have ices sent up several times  day well i ‘m bound  say  baker’s ices  not bad” “considering  they have been baked but they affect  mind” blanche went on “they would have affected captain lovelock’sonly   n’t any they certainly affected angela’sputting  into her head  eleven o’clock  come out  walk” angela did nothing whatever  defend herself against this ingenious sally she simply stood there  graceful abstraction bernard  vaguely vexed  her neither looking  him nor speaking  him her indifference seemed  contravention   right  criticism which gordon had bequeathed  him “i supposed people went  bed  eleven o’clock”  said angela glanced about her without meeting his eye “they seem  have gone” miss evers strolled on  her captain  course kept pace  her so  bernard  miss vivian  left standing together he looked  her  moment  silence but her eye still avoided his own “you  remarkably inconsistent” bernard presently said “you take  solemn vow  seclusion this afternoon  no sooner have you taken  than you proceed  break   this outrageous manner” she looked  him nowa long timelonger than she had ever done before “this  part   examination i suppose” she said bernard hesitated  instant “what examination” “the one you have undertakenon mr wright’s behalf” “what do you know about that” “ah you admit  then”  girl exclaimed   eager laugh “i don’t   least admit it” said bernard conscious only   moment   duty  loyalty  his friend  feeling  negation here  simply  point  honor “i trust more  my own conviction than  your denial you have engaged  bring your superior wisdom  your immense experience  bear upon me that ‘s  understanding” “you must think us  pretty pair  wiseacres” said bernard “there  isyou already begin  answer  what i think when mr wright comes back you   able  tell him  i am ‘outrageous’” and she turned away  walked on slowly following her companions “what do you care what i tell him” bernard asked “you don’t care  straw” she said nothing   moment then suddenly she stopped again dropping her eyes “i beg your pardon” she said very gently “i care  great deal it ‘s  well  you should know that” bernard stood looking  her her eyes  still lowered “do you know what i shall tell him i shall tell him  about eleven o’clock  night you become peculiarly attractive” she went  again  few steps miss evers  captain lovelock had turned round   coming toward her “it  very true  i am outrageous” she said “it  extremely silly   very bad taste  come out  this hour mamma  not  all pleased  i  very unkind  her i only wanted  take  turn  now we  go back” on  others coming up she announced this resolution  though captain lovelock  his companion made  great outcry she carried her point bernard offered no opposition he contented himself  walking back  her mother’s lodging  her almost  silence the little winding streets  still  empty there  no sound but  chatter  laughter  blanche  her attendant swain angela said nothing this incident presented itself  first  bernard’s

but bernard presently perceived her seated under  tree  victor cousin  her hand as bernard approached  young girl angela who had not seen him turned round “don’t move”  said “you  just   position  which i painted your portrait  siena” “don’t speak  that” she answered “i have never understood” said bernard “why you insist upon ignoring  charming incident” she resumed   moment her former position  stood looking   opposite hills “that ‘s just how you werein profilewith your head  little thrown back” “it   odious incident” angela exclaimed rapidly changing her attitude bernard    point  making  rejoinder but  thought  gordon wright  held his tongue he presently told her   intended  leave baden   morrow they  walking toward her mother she looked round  him quickly “where  you going” “to paris”  said quite  hazard   had not   least determined where  go “to parisin  month  august” and she gave  little laugh “what  happy inspiration” she gave  little laugh but she said nothing more  bernard gave no further account  his plan they went  sat down near mrs vivian  ten minutes  then they got up again  strolled  another part   garden they had  all  themselves    filled  things  bernard likedinequalities  level  mossy steps connecting them rosetrees trained upon old brick walls horizontal trellises arranged like italian pergolas  here  there  towering poplar looking  if  had survived  some more primitive stage  culture   stiff boughs motionless   leaves forever trembling they made almost  whole circuit   garden  then angela mentioned very quietly  she had heard  morning  mr wright    would not return  another week “you had better stay” she presently added  if gordon’s continued absence   added reason “i don’t know” said bernard “it  sometimes difficult  say what one had better do” i hesitate  bring against him  most inglorious  all charges  accusation  sentimental fatuity   disposition  invent obstacles  enjoyment so   might have  pleasure  seeing  pretty girl attempt  remove them but  must  admitted  if bernard really thought  present   had better leave baden  observation i have just quoted  not so much  sign  this conviction    hope  his companion would proceed  gainsay it the hope  not disappointed though i must add  no sooner had  been gratified than bernard began  feel ashamed  it “this certainly  not one  those cases” said angela “the thing  surely very simple now” “what makes  so simple” she hesitated  moment “the fact  i ask you  stay” “you ask me”  repeated softly “ah” she exclaimed “one does n’t say those things twice” she turned away  they went back  her mother who gave bernard  wonderful little look  half urgent half remonstrant inquiry as they left  garden  walked beside mrs vivian angela going  front  them   distance the elder lady began immediately  talk  him  gordon wright “he ‘s not coming back  another week you know” she said “i am sorry  stays away so long” “ah yes” bernard answered “it seems very long indeed” and  had  fact seemed  him very long “i suppose   always likely  have business” said mrs vivian “you may  very sure   not  his pleasure   stays away” “i know   faithful  old friends” said mrs vivian “i am sure   not forgotten us” “i certainly count upon that” bernard exclaimed“remembering him  we do” mrs vivian glanced  him gratefully “oh yes we remember himwe remember him daily hourly at least i can speak  my daughter  myself he  been so very kind  us” bernard said nothing  she went on “and you have been so very kind  us too mr longueville i want so much  thank you” “oh no don’t” said bernard frowning “i would rather you should n’t” “of course” mrs vivian added “i know  ‘s all  his account but  makes me wish  thank you all  more let me express my gratitude  advance   rest   time till  comes back that ‘s more responsibility than you bargained for” she said   little nervous laugh “yes  ‘s more than i bargained for i am thinking  going away” mrs vivian almost gave  little jump  then she paused   baden cobblestones looking up  him “if you must go mr longuevilledon’t sacrifice yourself” the exclamation fell upon bernard’s ear   certain softly mocking cadence which  sufficient however  make this organ tingle “oh after all you know”  said  they walked on“after all you know i am not like wrighti have no business” he walked   ladies   door  their lodging angela kept always  front she stood there however   little confectioner’s window until  others came up she let her mother pass in  then she said  bernard looking  him “shall i see you again” “some time i hope” “i meanare you going away” bernard looked   moment   little pink sugar cheruba species  cupid   gilded bowwhich figured among  pastrycook’s enticements then  said “i  come  tell you this evening” and   evening  went  tell her she had mentioned during  walk   garden   schloss  they should not go out as  approached mrs vivian’s door  saw  figure   light dress standing   little balcony he stopped  looked up  then  person   light dress leaning her hands   railing  her shoulders  little raised bent over  looked down  him it  very dark but even through  thick dusk  thought  perceived  finest brilliancy  angela vivian’s smile “i shall not go away”  said lifting his voice  little she made no answer she only stood looking down  him through  warm dusk  smiling he went into  house   remained  badenbaden till gordon came back chapter xiv gordon asked him no questions  twentyfour hours after his return then suddenly  began “well have n’t you something  say  me” it    hotel  gordon’s apartment late   afternoon a heavy thunderstorm had broken over  place  hour before  bernard had been standing  one  his friend’s windows rather idly  his hands  his pockets watching  raintorrents dance upon  empty pavements at last  deluge abated  clouds began  breakthere   promise   fine evening gordon wright while  storm    climax sat down  write letters  wrote half  dozen it  after  had sealed directed  affixed  postagestamp   last   series   addressed  his companion  question i have just quoted “do you mean about miss vivian” bernard asked without turning round   window “about miss vivian  course” bernard said nothing  his companion went on “have you nothing  tell me about miss vivian” bernard presently turned round looking  gordon  smiling  little “she ‘s  delightful creature” “that won’t doyou have tried  before” said gordon “no”  added   moment “that won’t do” bernard turned back   window  gordon continued   remained silent “i shall have  right  consider your saying nothing  proof   unfavorable judgment you don’t like her” bernard faced quickly about again    instant  two men looked  each other “ah my dear gordon” longueville murmured “do you like her then” asked wright getting up “no” said longueville “that ‘s just what i wanted  know  i am much obliged  you  telling me” “i am not obliged  you  asking me i   hopes you would n’t” “you dislike her very much then” gordon exclaimed gravely “won’t disliking her simply do” said bernard “it  do very well but   do  little better if you  tell me why give me  reason or two” “well” said bernard “i tried  make love  her  she boxed my ears” “the devil” cried gordon “i mean morally you know” gordon stared  seemed  little puzzled “you tried  make love  her morally” “she boxed my ears morally” said bernard laughing out “why did you try  make love  her” this inquiry  made   tone so expressive   unbiassed truthseeking habit  bernard’s mirth  not immediately quenched nevertheless  replied  sufficient gravity “to test her fidelity  you could you have expected anything else you told me you  afraid she   latent coquette you gave me  chance  i tried  ascertain” “and you found she  not is  what you mean” “she ‘s  firm   rock my dear gordon miss vivian   firm   firmest  your geological formations” gordon shook his head   strange positive persistence “you  talking nonsense you  not serious you  not telling me  truth i don’t believe  you attempted  make love  her you would n’t have played such  game  that it would n’t have been honorable” bernard flushed  little   irritated “oh come don’t make too much   point  that did n’t you tell me before     great opportunity” “an opportunity   wisenot   foolish” “ah there  only one sort  opportunity” cried bernard “you exaggerate  reach  human wisdom” “suppose she had let you make love  her” said gordon “that would have been  beautiful result  your experiment” “i should have seemed  you  rascal perhaps but i should have saved you   latent coquette you would owe some thanks  that” “and now you have n’t saved me” said gordon   simple air  noting  fact “you assumein spite  what i saythat she   coquette” “i assume something because you evidently conceal something i want  whole truth” bernard turned back   window  increasing irritation “if  wants  whole truth  shall have it”  said  himself he stood  moment  thought  then  looked  his companion again “i think she would marry youbut i don’t think she cares  you” gordon turned  little pale but  clapped his hands together “very good”  exclaimed “that ‘s exactly how i want you  speak” “her mother  taken  great fancy  your fortune    rubbed off   girl who  made up her mind   would   pleasant thing  have thirty thousand  year   her not caring  you   unimportant detail” “i seei see” said gordon looking  his friend   air  admiration  his frank  lucid way  putting things now   had begun   frank  lucid bernard found  charm  it   impulse under which  had spoken urged him almost violently forward “the mother  daughter have agreed together  bag you  angela i am sure  made  vow    nice  you after marriage  possible mrs vivian  insisted upon  importance  that mrs vivian   great moralist” gordon kept gazing  his friend  seemed positively fascinated “yes i have noticed   mrs vivian”  said “ah she ‘s  very nice woman” “it ‘s not true then” said gordon “that you tried  make love  angela” bernard hesitated  single instant “no   n’t true i calumniated myself  save her reputation you insisted  my giving you  reason  my not liking heri gave you  one” “and your real reason” “my real reason   i believe she would do you what i can’t help regarding   injury” “of course”  gordon dropping his interested eyes stared  some moments   carpet “but   n’t true then  you discovered her    coquette” “ah  ‘s another matter” “you did discover  all  same” “since you want  whole truthi did” “how did you discover it” gordon asked clinging  his right  interrogation bernard hesitated “you must remember  i saw  great deal  her” “you mean  she encouraged you” “if i had not been  very faithful friend i might have thought so” gordon laid his hand appreciatively gratefully  bernard’s shoulder “and even  did n’t make you like her” “confound it you make me blush” cried bernard blushing  little  fact “i have said quite enough excuse me  drawing  portrait  too insensible  man it  my point  view i kept thinking  you” gordon  his hand still  his friend’s arm patted   instant  response  this declaration then  turned away “i am much obliged  you that ‘s my notion  friendship you have spoken out like  man” “like  man yes remember that not   least like  oracle” “i prefer  honest man  all  oracles” said gordon “an honest man  his impressions i have given you minethey pretend   nothing more i hope they have n’t offended you” “not   least” “nor distressed nor depressed nor  any way discomposed you” “for what do you take me i asked you  favora service i imposed   you you have done  thing  my part  simple gratitude” “thank you  nothing” said bernard smiling “you have asked me  great many questions there  one   turn i have  right  ask you what do you propose  do  consequence  what i have told you” “i propose  do nothing” this declaration closed  colloquy   young men separated bernard saw gordon no more  evening  took  granted  had gone  mrs vivian’s the burden  longueville’s confidences   heavy load  carry there but bernard ventured  hope   would deposit    door he had given gordon his impressions   latter might do  them what  chosetoss them out   window or let them grow stale  heedless keeping so bernard meditated   wandered about alone   rest   evening it  useless  look  mrs vivian’s little circle   terrace   conversationhouse   storm   afternoon had made  place so damp    almost forsaken   frequenters bernard spent  evening   gamingrooms   thick   crowd  pressed about  tables   way   changehe had hitherto been almost nothing   gamblerhe laid down  couple  pieces  roulette he had played but two or three times without winning  penny but now  had  agreeable sensation  drawing   small handful  gold he continued  play   continued  win his luck surprised  excited himso much so  after  had repeated itself half  dozen times  left  place  walked about  half  hour   outer darkness he felt amused  exhilarated but  feeling amounted almost  agitation he nevertheless returned   tables where  again found success awaiting him again  again  put his money   happy number  so steady  run  luck began  last  attract attention the rumor   spread through  rooms   crowd about  roulette received  large contingent  spectators bernard felt  they  looking more or less eagerly   turn   tide but     humor  disappointing them   left  place while his luck  still running high  ten thousand francs  his pocket it  very late when  returned   innso late   forbore  knock  gordon’s door but though  betook himself  his own quarters   far  finding or even seeking immediate rest he knocked about   would have said  half  nightnot because   delighted  having won ten thousand francs but rather because all   sudden  found himself disgusted   manner  which  had spent  evening it  extremely characteristic  bernard longueville  his pleasure should suddenly transform itself into flatness what  felt  not regret or repentance he had  not   least  his conscience   had given countenance   reprehensible practice  gaming it  annoyance   had passed out  his own controlthat  had obeyed  force which   unable  measure   time he had been drunk    turning sober in spite   great momentary appearance  frankness   lively relish  any conjunction  agreeable circumstances exerting  pressure  which one could respond bernard had really little taste  giving himself up   never did so without very soon wishing  take himself back he had now given himself  something   not himself   fact   had gained ten thousand francs     insufficient salve   aching sense  having ceased   his own master he had not been playinghe had been played with he had been  sport   blind brutal chance   felt humiliated  having been favored  so rudelyoperating  divinity good luck  bad luck bernard felt very scornful   distinction save  good luck seemed  him rather  more vulgar as  night went  his disgust deepened   last  weariness  brought   sent him  sleep he slept very late  woke up   disagreeable consciousness at first before collecting his thoughts  could not imagine what  had  his mindwas    had spoken ill  angela vivian it brought him extraordinary relief  remember   had gone  bed  extreme illhumor  his exploits  roulette after  had dressed himself  just    leaving his room  servant brought him  note superscribed  gordon’s handa note  which  following proved    contents “seven o’clock am “my dear bernard circumstances have determined me  leave baden immediately  i shall take  train  starts  hour hence i am told  you came  very late last night so i won’t disturb you   painful parting  this unnatural hour i came  this decision last evening  i put up my things so i have nothing  do but  take myself off i shall go  basel but after  i don’t know where   so comfortless  uncertainty i don’t ask you  follow me perhaps i shall go  america but  any case i shall see you sooner or later meanwhile my dear bernard   happy  your brilliant talents should properly make you  believe me yours ever “gw “ps it  perhaps  well  i should say  i am leaving  consequence  something  happened last evening but notby any traceable processin consequence   talk we had together i may also add  i am  very good health  spirits” bernard lost no time  learning  his friend had  fact departed   eight o’clock trainthe morning  now well advanced  then over his breakfast  gave himself up  meditative surprise what had happened during  eveningwhat had happened after their conversation  gordon’s room he had gone  mrs vivian’swhat had happened there bernard found  difficult  believe   had gone there simply  notify her that having talked  over   intimate friend  gave up her daughter or  mention   young lady herself   had ceased  desire  honor  her hand gordon alluded  some definite occurrence yet   inconceivable   should have allowed himself   determined  bernard’s wordshis diffident  irresponsible impression bernard resented this idea   injury  himself yet   difficult  imagine what else could have happened there  gordon’s word  it however  there  no “traceable” connection between  circumstances which led  his sudden departure   information  had succeeded  extracting  his friend what did  mean   “traceable” connection gordon never used words idly   meant  make  this point  intelligible distinction it  this sense  his usual accuracy  expression  assisted bernard  fitting  meaning  his late companion’s letter he intended  intimate   had come back  baden  his mind made up  relinquish his suit    had questioned bernard simply  moral curiosityfor  sake  intellectual satisfaction nothing  altered   fact  bernard had told him  sorry tale  had not modified his behaviorthat effect would have been traceable it had simply affected his imagination which   consequence   imponderable sort this view   case  supported  gordon’s mention  his good spirits a man always had good spirits when  had acted  harmony   conviction of course after renouncing  attempt  make himself acceptable  miss vivian  only possible thing  gordon had been  leave baden bernard continuing  meditate  last convinced himself  there had been no explicit rupture  gordon’s last visit had simply been  visit  farewell   character had sufficiently signified his withdrawal    had now gone away because after giving  girl up  wished very naturally not  meet her again this was  bernard’s part  sufficiently coherent view   case but nevertheless  hour afterward   strolled along  lichtenthal alley  found himself stopping suddenly  exclaiming under his breath“have i done her  injury have i affected her prospects” later   day  said  himself half  dozen times   had simply warned gordon against  incongruous union chapter xv now  gordon  gone  any rate gone  good  not  return  felt  sudden  singular sense  freedom it   feeling  unbounded expansion quite out  proportion   said  himself  any assignable cause everything suddenly appeared  have become very optional but   quite   loss what  do  his liberty it seemed  harmless use  make  it   afternoon  go  pay another visit   ladies who lived   confectioner’s here however  met  reception which introduced  fresh element  perplexity into  situation  gordon had left behind him the door  opened  him  mrs vivian’s maidservant  sturdy daughter   schwartzwald who informed him   ladieswith much regretwere unable  receive any one “they  very busyand they  ill” said  young woman  way  explanation bernard  disappointed   felt like arguing  case “surely”  said “they  not both ill  busy when you make excuses you should make them agree  each other” the teutonic soubrette fixed her round blue eyes  minute upon  patch  blue sky revealed  her  her open door “i say what i can lieber herr it ‘s not my fault if i ‘m not so clever   french mamsell one   ladies  busy  other  ill there you have it” “not quite” said bernard “you must remember  there  three  them” “oh  little onethe little one weeps” “miss evers weeps” exclaimed bernard  whom  vision  this young lady  tears had never presented itself “that happens  young ladies when they  unhappy” said  girl    artless yet significant smile she carried  big red hand   left side   broad bosom “i am sorry she  unhappy but which   other ladies  ill” “the mother  very busy” “and  daughter  ill” the young woman looked  him  instant smiling again   light  her little blue eyes indicated confusion but not perversity “no  mamma  ill” she exclaimed “and  daughter  very busy they  preparing  leave baden” “to leave baden when do they go” “i don’t quite know lieber herr but very soon” with this information bernard turned away he  rather surprised but  reflected  mrs vivian had not proposed  spend her life   banks   oos   people  leaving baden every day   year in  evening   kursaal  met captain lovelock who  wandering about   air  explosive sadness “damn it they ‘re goingyes they ‘re going” said  captain after  two young men had exchanged  few allusions  current events

bore bernard  grudge  speaking ill  her  so long  this disagreeable impression should last  preferred not  see him bernard  frank enough  charge  poor fellow   lingering rancor  which  made indeed no great crime but gordon denied  allegation  assured him that  his own perception there  no decline  their intimacy he only requested   favor    tribute  “just susceptibilities”  bernard would allude no

happily arranged he heard nothing  mrs vivian  her daughter beyond  rumor  they had gone  italy   learned  apparently good authority  blanche evers had returned  new york  her mother he wondered whether captain lovelock  still  pawn   hotel de hollande if  did not allow himself  wonder too curiously whether  had done  harm  gordon  may  affirmed    haunted   recurrence   other question  which

friend again gordon glanced  him  moment  then coloring  little looked straight out   window whereupon bernard remembered  these  just  terms  which  baden after his companion’s absence  had attempted  qualify angela vivian gordon  conscioushe  conscious   oddity  his situation “of course  surprised you”  said   moment still looking out   window “what my dear fellow” “my marriage” “well you know” said bernard “everything surprises me i am   very conjectural habit  mind all sorts  ideas come into my head  yet when  simplest things happen i am always rather startled i live   reverie  i am perpetually waked up  people doing things” gordon transferred his eyes   window  bernard’s faceto his whole person “you  waked up but you fall asleep again” “i fall asleep very easily” said bernard gordon looked  him  head  foot smiling  shaking his head “you  not changed”  said “you have travelled  unknown lands you have had i suppose all sorts  adventures but you   same man i used  know” “i am sorry  that” “you have  same way  representingof misrepresenting yourself” “well if i am not changed” said bernard “i can ill afford  lose so valuable  art” “taking you altogether i am glad you   same” gordon answered simply “but you must come into my part   house” chapter xvii yes   conscioushe  very conscious so bernard reflected during  two or three first days  his visit  his friend gordon knew  must seem strange  so irreverent  critic   man who had once aspired   hand  so intelligent  girlputting other things asideas angela vivian should   ghost  “hamlet” says have “declined upon”  young lady who  force  understanding  so very much miss vivian’s inferior  this knowledge kept him ill  his ease  gave him  certain pitiable awkwardness bernard’s sense   anomaly grew rapidly less acute  made various observations which helped   seem natural blanche  wonderfully pretty she  very graceful innocent amusing since gordon had determined  marry  little goose  had chosen  animal  extreme discernment it had quite  plumage   swan   sailed along  stream  life   extraordinary lightness  motion he asked himself indeed  times whether blanche  really so silly  she seemed  doubted whether any woman could  so silly  blanche seemed he had  suspicion  times that  ends  her own she  playing  partthe suspicion arising   fact that  usually happens  such cases she overplayed it her

scrap   mind somewhere  even  little particle   heart if one looked long enough one might catch  glimpse  these possessions but why should she keep them out  sight  what   ends  she proposed  serve  this uncomfortable perversity bernard wondered whether she  fond  her husband   heard  intimated  several good people  new york who had had some observation   courtship  she had married him  his money he  very sorry  find  this  taken  granted   determined   whole not  believe it he  disgusted   idea  such  want  gratitude for if gordon wright had loved miss evers  herself  young lady might certainly have discovered  intrinsic value  so disinterested  suitor her mother had  credit  having made  match gordon  known   looking   wife mrs evers had put her little featherhead   daughter very much forward  gordon   easily captivated   child   sound   rattle blanche had  affection  him now however bernard saw no reason  doubt that  certainly she would have been  very flimsy creature indeed if she had not been touched  his inexhaustible kindness she had every conceivable indulgence  if she married him  his money  least she had got what she wanted she led  most agreeable life conceivable  she ought    high goodhumor it  impossible  have  prettier house  prettier carriage more jewels  laces   adornment   plump little person it  impossible  go  more parties  give better dinners  have fewer privations or annoyances bernard  so much struck  all this that advancing rapidly   intimacy  his gracious hostess  ventured  call her attention  her blessings she answered  she  perfectly aware  them  there  no pretty speech she  not prepared  make about gordon “i know what you want  say” she went on “you want  say   spoils me  i don’t see why you should hesitate you generally say everything you want  you need n’t  afraid  me he does n’t spoil me simply because i am so bad i can’t  spoiled but  ‘s  no consequence i  spoiled ages ago every one spoiled meevery one except mrs vivian i  always fond  having everything i want  i generally managed  get it i always had lovely clothes mamma thought    kind   duty if    duty i don’t suppose  counts   part   spoiling but i  very much indulged  i know i have everything now gordon   perfect husband i believe if i   ask him   present  his nose  would cut  off  give   me i think i  ask him   small piece   some day   rather improve him  have  inch or two less i don’t say  ‘s handsome but  ‘s just  good   can be some people say  if you  very fond   person you always think them handsome but i don’t agree    all i am very fond  gordon  yet i am not blinded  affection  regards his personal appearance he ‘s too light  my taste  too red and because you think people handsome  does n’t follow  you  fond  them i used  have  friend who  awfully handsomethe handsomest man i ever sawand i  perfectly conscious  his defects but i ‘m not conscious  gordon’s  i don’t believe   got any he ‘s so intensely kind  ‘s quite pathetic one would think  had done me  injury  marrying me    wanted  make up  it if   done me  injury i have n’t discovered  yet  i don’t believe i ever shall i certainly shall not  long   lets me order all  clothes i want i have ordered five dresses this week  i mean  order two more when i told gordon what do you think  did he simply kissed me well if  ‘s not expressive i don’t know what  could have done he kisses me about seventeen times  day i suppose  ‘s very improper   woman  tell any one how often her husband kisses her but  you happen  have seen him do it i don’t suppose you   scandalized i know you  not easily scandalized i am not afraid  you you  scandalized  my getting so many dresses well i told you i  spoiledi freely acknowledge it that ‘s why i  afraid  tell gordonbecause when i  married i had such  lot  things i  supposed  have dresses enough  last   year but gordon had n’t  pay  them so there  no harm  my letting him feel     wife if  thinks i am extravagant  can easily stop kissing me you don’t think  would  easy  stop it ‘s very well then  those  have never begun” bernard had  good deal  conversation  blanche  which so far  she  concerned  foregoing remarks may serve   specimen

speak   without  pretty little shudder “nothing would induce me  go there again” she declared “and i consider myself very fortunate  have escaped    my life it ‘s filled  all sorts  horrible things

positive guarantee  gordon’s future felicity but often  course gordon   auditor  well i say  auditor because  seemed  bernard   had grown   less   talker than  yore doubtless when  man finds himself

he had done  only thing possible but  made  no better  her he had wronged her the circumstances mattered nothing    could not make  up  her  only reasonable thing   keep out  her way he had stepped

yet apparently   none  worse  that but his hope   should himself escape unperceived had now become acute it  singular  this hope should not have led him instantly  turn his back  move away but

 while   blue horizon straight  front  her but  yet without turning them aside this however augmented  danger  her doing so  bernard   good deal   effort rose  his feet the effort doubtless kept

lasted need not  narrated it  probably  matter   few seconds but  bernard  seemed  little eternity he met her eyes  looked straight into her face now  she had seen him  could do nothing else bernard’s little eternity however came   end miss vivian dropped her eyes upon her book again she let them rest upon  only  moment then she closed   slowly rose  her chair turning away  bernard he still stood looking  herstupidly foolishly helplessly enough   seemed  him no sign  recognition had been exchanged angela vivian hesitated  minute she now had her back turned  him   fancied her light flexible figure  agitated  her indecision she looked along  sunny beach which stretched  shallow curve  where  little bay ended   white wall   cliffs began she looked down toward  sea  up toward  little casino which  perched   low embankment communicating   beach  two or three points   short flight  steps bernard sawor supposed  sawthat she  asking herself whither she had best turn  avoid him he had not blushed when she looked  himhe had rather turned  little pale but  blushed now   really seemed odious  have literally driven  poor girl  bay miss vivian decided  take refuge   casino  she passed along one   little pathways  planks   laid here  there across  beach  directed herself   nearest flight  steps before she had gone two paces  complete change came over bernard’s feeling his only wish now   speak  herto explainto tell her  would go away there  another row  steps   short distance behind him  rapidly ascended them  reached  little terrace   casino miss vivian stood there she  apparently hesitating again which way  turn bernard came straight up  her   gallant smile   greeting the comparison   coarse one but  felt    taking  bull   horns angela vivian stood watching him arrive “you did n’t recognize me”  said “and your not recognizing me made memade me hesitate” for  moment she said nothing  then “you  more timid than you used  be” she answered he could hardly have said what expression  had expected  find  her face his apprehension had perhaps not painted her obtrusively pale  haughty aggressively cold  stern but  had figured something different   look  encountered miss vivian  simply blushingthat  what bernard mainly perceived  saw  her surprise had been extremecomplete her blush  reassuring  contradicted  idea  impatient resentment  bernard took some satisfaction  noting    prolonged “yes i am more timid than i used  be”  said in spite  her blush she continued  look  him very directly but she had always done thatshe always met one’s eye  bernard now instantly found all  beauty   had ever found before  her pure unevasive glance “i don’t know whether i am more brave” she said “but i must tell  truthi instantly recognized you” “you gave no sign” “i supposed i gave  striking onein getting up  going away” “ah” said bernard “as i say i am more timid than i was  i did n’t venture  interpret    sign  recognition” “it   sign  surprise” “not  pleasure” said bernard he felt this    venturesome    point  view  taste perhaps  reprehensible remark but  made  because   now feeling his ground   seemed better  make  gravely than  assumed jocosity “great surprises   me never pleasures” angela answered “i am not fond  shocks  any kind the pleasure  another matter i have not yet got over my surprise” “if i had known you  here i would have written  you beforehand” said bernard laughing miss vivian beneath her expanded parasol gave  little shrug  her shoulders “even  would have been  surprise” “you mean  shock eh did you suppose i  dead” now  last she lowered her eyes  her blush slowly died away “i knew nothing about it” “of course you could n’t know  we  all mortal it  natural  you should n’t expectsimply  turning your headto find me lying   pebbles  blanquaislesgalets you   great surprise  me  well but i differ  youi like surprises” “it  rather refreshing  hear  one   surprise” said  girl “especially when   capacity one  liked” bernard exclaimed “i don’t say thatbecause such sensations pass away i am now beginning  get over mine” the light mockery  her tone struck him   echo   unforgotten air he looked  her  moment  then  said “you  not changed i find you quite  same” “i am sorry  that” and she turned away “what  you doing”  asked “where  you going” she looked about her without answering up  down  little terrace the casino  blanquais   much more modest place  reunion than  conversationhouse  badenbaden it   small low structure  brightly painted wood containing but three or four rooms  furnished all along  front   narrow covered gallery which offered  delusive shelter   rougher moods   fine fresh weather it  somewhat rude  shabbythe subscription   season  lowbut  had  simple picturesqueness its little terrace   very convenient place   stroll   great view   ocean    marblewhite crags  formed  broad gateway   shallow bay   sufficient compensation   absence  luxuries there   few people sitting   gallery   few others scattered upon  terrace but  pleasureseekers  blanquais were   most part immersed   salt water or disseminated   grassy downs “i am looking  my mother” said angela vivian “i hope your mother  well” “very well thank you” “may i help you  look  her” bernard asked her eyes paused  their quest  rested  moment upon her companion “she  not here” she said presently “she  gone home” “what do you call home” bernard demanded “the sort  place  we always call home  bad little house  we have taken   month” “will you let me come  see it” “it ‘s nothing  see” bernard hesitated  moment “is   refusal” “i should never think  giving  so fine  name” “there would  nothing fine  forbidding me your door don’t think that” said bernard  rather  forced laugh it  difficult  know what  girl thought but she said   moment “we shall  very happy  see you i am going home” “may i walk  you so far” asked bernard “it  not far  ‘s only three minutes” and angela moved slowly   gate   casino chapter xx bernard walked beside her   some moments nothing  said between them as  silence continued  became aware  it   vexed him  she should leave certain things unsaid she had asked him no questionneither whence  had come nor how long  would stay nor what had happened  him since they parted he wished  see whether this  intention or accident he  already complaining  himself  she expressed no interest  him    perfectly aware  this   ridiculous feeling he had come  speak  her  order  tell her    going away  yet   end  five minutes  had asked leave  come  see her this sudden gyration  mind  grotesque  bernard knew it but nevertheless  had  immense expectation that if  should give her time she would manifest some curiosity   his own situation he tried  give her time  held his tongue but she continued  say nothing they passed along  sort  winding lane where two or three fishermen’s cottages  old brown nets suspended   walls  drying   sun stood open   road   other side  which   patch  saltlooking grass browsed   donkey   not fastidious “it ‘s so long since we parted  we have so much  say  each other” bernard exclaimed  last   accompanied this declaration   laugh much more spontaneous than  one  had given  few moments before it might have gratified him however  observe  his companion appeared  see no ground  joking   idea  they should have  good deal  say  each other “yes  ‘s  long time since we spent those pleasant weeks  baden” she rejoined “have you been there again” this   question  though    very simple one bernard  charmed  it “i would n’t go back   world”  said “and you” “would i go back oh yes i thought  so agreeable” with this   less pleased  had expected  traces  resentment    actually disappointed  not finding them but here   little house  which his companion had spoken   seemed indeed  rather bad one that is   one  those diminutive structures which  known  french wateringplaces  “chalets” and   exiguity  furniture  let   season  families  pride themselves upon their powers

extremely fresh white curtains  gently fluttering   breath   neighboring ocean the little door stood wide open “this  where we live” said angela  she stopped  laid her hand upon  little gardengate “it ‘s very fair” said bernard “i think  ‘s better than  pastrycook’s  baden” they stood there  she looked over  gate   geraniums she did not ask him  come in but   other hand keeping  gate closed she made no movement  leave him the casino  now quite out  sight   whole place  perfectly still suddenly turning her eyes upon bernard   certain strange inconsequence “i have not seen you here before” she observed he gave  little laugh “i suppose  ‘s because i only arrived this morning i think  if i had been here you would have noticed me” “you arrived this morning” “three or four hours ago so if  remark  not  questionable taste i should say we had not lost time” “you may say what you please” said angela simply “where did you come from” interrogation now  had come  most satisfactory  bernard  glad  believe  there   element   unexpected  his answer “from california” “you came straight  california  this place” “i arrived  havre only yesterday” “and why did you come here” “it would  graceful  me   able  answer‘because i knew you  here’ but unfortunately i did not know it it   mere chance or rather i feel like saying    inspiration” angela looked   geraniums again “it  very singular” she said “we might have been  so many places besides this one and you might have come  so many places besides this one” “it  all  more singular  one   last persons i saw  america  your charming friend blanche who married gordon wright she did n’t tell me you  here” “she had no reason  know it” said  girl “she  not my friendas you  her husband’s friend” “ah no i don’t suppose that but she might have heard  you” “she does n’t hear  us my mother used  write  her   while after she left europe but she  given  up” she paused  moment  then she added“blanche  too silly” bernard noted this wondering how  bore upon his theory   spiteful element  his companion of course blanche  silly but equally  course this young lady’s perception    quickened  blanche’s having married  rich man whom she herself might have married “gordon does n’t think so” bernard said angela looked  him  moment “i am very glad  hear it” she rejoined gently “yes   very fortunate” “is  well”  girl asked “is  happy” “he  all  air  it” “i am very glad  hear it” she repeated and then she moved  latch   gate  passed in at  same moment her mother appeared   open doorway mrs vivian had apparently been summoned   sound  her daughter’s colloquy   unrecognized voice  when she saw bernard she gave  sharp little cry  surprise then she stood gazing  him since  dispersion   little party  badenbaden  had not devoted much

superior detestation the instant  beheld her  her threshold this conviction rose   surface  his consciousness  made him feel  now  least his hour had come “it  mr longueville whom we met  baden” said angela  her mother gravely mrs vivian began  smile  stepped down quickly toward  gate “ah mr longueville” she murmured “it ‘s so longit ‘s so pleasantit ‘s so strange” and suddenly she stopped still smiling her smile had  odd intensity she  trembling  little  bernard who  prepared  hissing scorn perceived   deep  almost violent surprise  touching agitation  eager friendliness “yes  ‘s very long”  said “it ‘s very pleasant i have only just arrived i met miss vivian” “and you  not coming in” asked angela’s mother very graciously “your daughter  not asked me” said bernard “ah my dearest” murmured mrs vivian looking   girl her daughter returned her glance  then  elder lady paused again  simply began  smile  bernard who recognized  her glance  queer little intimationshy  cautious yet perfectly discernibleof  desire  have  private understanding  what  felt  she mentally termed his better nature which  had more than once perceived  badenbaden “ah no she  not asked me” bernard repeated laughing gently then angela turned her eyes upon him   expression  those fine organs  strikingly agreeable it had moreover  merit  being easily interpreted  said very plainly “please don’t insist but leave me alone” and  said  not  all sharplyvery gently  pleadingly bernard found himself understanding  so well   literally blushed  intelligence “don’t you come   casino   evening  you used  come   kursaal”  asked mrs vivian looked again  her daughter who had passed into  doorway   cottage then she said “we  go this evening” “i shall look  you eagerly” bernard rejoined “auf wiedersehen  we used

who  been so good   interest himself  this little narrative  perhaps  this point exclaim   pardonable consciousness  shrewdness “of course  went  next day   rue de provence” of course yes only

 had also brought him  assurance  angela cared  little  possible  anything   chance acquaintance might have said about her it  all  more singular therefore  one evening after  had been  blanquais

vivian’s door chapter xxii it  opened   little waitingmaid whom  had seen  blanquais  who looked  him very hard before she answered his inquiry “you see i have found mrs vivian’s dwelling though you would n’t give me  address” bernard said  her smiling “monsieur  put some time  it”  young woman answered dryly and she informed him  madame   home though mademoiselle  whom  had not asked  not mrs

bernard “your maid  blanquais refused  give   me” mrs vivian gave him  little lookthere  always more or less    her facewhich seemed equivalent   entreaty  her interlocutor should spare her “maids  so strange” she murmured “especially  french” it pleased bernard   moment not  spare her though  felt  sort  delight  kindness  her “your going off  blanquais so suddenly without leaving me any explanation any clue any message  any sortmade me feel  first  if you did n’t wish  i should look you up it reminded me   way you left badendo you rememberthree years ago” “baden  so charmingbut one could n’t stay forever” said mrs vivian “i had  sort  theory one could our life  so pleasant   seemed  shame  break  spell  if no one had moved i am sure we might  sitting there now” mrs vivian stared still  her little fixed smile “i think we should have had bad weather” “very likely” said bernard laughing “nature would have grown jealous  our goodhumorof our tranquil happiness and after all here we  together againthat is some  us but i have only my own audacity  thank  it i  quite free  believe  you  not  all pleased  see me reappearand   only because i am not easy  discourageam indeed

cried  she stood there waiting  listening smiling  bernard  her handkerchief pressed  her lips in  moment  girl came into  drawingroom but  seeing bernard she stopped  her hand   doorknob her mother went  her  kissed her “it ‘s mr longueville dearesthe  found us out” “found us out” repeated angela   little laugh “what  singular expression” she  blushing  she had blushed when she first saw him  blanquais she seemed  bernard now  have  great  peculiar brightnesssomething she had never had before “i certainly have been looking  you”  said “i  greatly disappointed when i found you had taken flight  blanquais” “taken flight” she repeated his words  she had repeated her mother’s “that  also  strange way  speaking” “i don’t care what i say” said bernard “so long  i make you understand  i have wanted very much  see you again   i have wondered every day whether i might venture” “i don’t know why you should n’t venture” she interrupted giving her little laugh again “we  not so terrible  we mammathat is when once you have climbed our five flights  stairs” “i came up very fast” said bernard “and i find your apartment magnificent” “mr longueville must come again must  not dear” asked mamma “i shall come very often  your leave” bernard declared “it   immensely kind” said angela looking away “i am not sure  you  think  that” “i don’t know what you  trying  prove” said angela “first  we ran away  you  then  we  not nice  our visitors” “oh no not that” bernard exclaimed “for i assure you i shall not care how cold you   me” she walked away toward another door which  masked   curtain  she lifted “i am glad  hear that   gives me courage  say  i am very tired   i beg you  excuse me” she glanced  him  moment over her shoulder then she passed out dropping  curtain bernard stood there face  face  mrs vivian whose eyes seemed  plead  him more than ever in his own there   excited smile “please don’t mind that” she murmured “i know  ‘s true  she  tired” “mind it dear lady” cried  young man “i delight  it it ‘s just what i like” “ah she ‘s very peculiar” sighed mrs vivian “she  strangeyes but i think i understand her  little” “you must come back tomorrow then” “i hope  have many tomorrows” cried bernard   took his departure chapter xxiii and  had them  fact he called  next day   same hour   found  mother   daughter together  their pretty salon angela  very gentle  gracious  suspected mrs vivian had given her  tender little lecture upon  manner  which she had received him  day before after  had been there five minutes mrs vivian took  decanter  water   standing upon  table  went out   balcony  irrigate her flowers bernard watched her  while  his place   room then she moved along  balcony  out  sight some ten minutes elapsed without her reappearing  then bernard stepped   threshold   window  looked  her she  not there    came  took his seat near angela again  announced rather formally  mrs vivian had passed back into one   other windows angela  silent  momentthen she said “should you like me  call her” she  very peculiarthat  very true yet bernard held  his declaration   day before   now understood her  little “no i don’t desire it”  said “i wish  see you alone i have something particular  say  you” she turned her face toward him  there  something   expression  showed him   looked  her more serious than  had ever looked he sat down again  some moments  hesitated  go on “you frighten me” she said laughing   spite  her laugh this  obviously true “i assure you my state  mind  anything but formidable i am afraid  you   contrary i am humble  apologetic” “i am sorry  that” said angela “i particularly dislike receiving apologies even when i know what they  for what yours  for i can’t imagine” “you don’t dislike meyou don’t hate me” bernard suddenly broke out “you don’t ask me  humbly excuse me therefore if i say i have other  more practical things  do” “you despise me” said bernard “that  not humble either  you seem  insist upon it” “it would  after all  way  thinking  me  i have  reason  wishing you  do that” “i remember very well  you used  have  reason  everything it  not always  good one” “this one  excellent” said bernard gravely “i have been  love  you  three years” she got up slowly turning away “is  what you wished  say  me” she went toward  open window   followed her “i hope  does n’t offend you i don’t say  lightlyit ‘s not  piece  gallantry it ‘s  very truth  my being i did n’t know  till latelystrange   may seem i loved you long before i knew itbefore i ventured or presumed  know it i  thinking  you when i seemed  myself   thinking  other things it  very strangethere  things   i don’t understand i travelled over  world i tried  interest  divert myself but  bottom    perfect failure to see you againthat  what i wanted when i saw you last month  blanquais i knew it then everything became clear it   answer   riddle i wished  read  very clearlyi wished   sure therefore i did n’t follow you immediately i questioned my hearti crossquestioned it it  borne  examination  now i am sure i am very sure i love you  my lifei beg you  listen  me” she had listenedshe had listened intently looking straight out   window  without moving “you have seen very little  me” she said presently turning her illuminated eye  him “i have seen enough” bernard added smiling “you must remember   baden i saw  good deal  you” “yes but  did n’t make you like me i don’t understand” bernard stood there  moment frowning  his eyes lowered “i can imagine that but i think i can explain” “don’t explain now” said angela “you have said enough explain some other time” and she went out   balcony bernard  course   moment  beside her and disregarding her injunction  began  explain “i thought i disliked youbut i have come   conclusion   just  contrary in reality i   love  you i had been so   first time i saw youwhen i made  sketch  you  siena” “that  itself needs  explanation i  not  all nice theni  very rude very perverse i  horrid” “ah you admit it” cried bernard   sort  quick elation she had been pale but she suddenly blushed “your own conduct  singular  i remember it it  not exactly agreeable” “perhaps not but  least   meant  be i did n’t know how  please you then  i am far  supposing  i have learned now but i entreat you  give me  chance” she  silent  while her eyes wandered over  great prospect  paris “do you know how you can please me now” she said  last “by leaving me alone” bernard looked  her  moment then came straight back into  drawingroom  took his hat “you see i avail myself   first chance but i shall come back tomorrow” “i am greatly obliged  you  what you have said such  speech   deserves   listened   consideration you may come back tomorrow” angela added on  morrow when  came back she received him alone “how did you know  baden  i did n’t like you”  asked  soon  she would allow him she smiled very gently “you assured me yesterday  you did like me” “i mean  i supposed i did n’t how did you know that” “i can only say  i observed” “you must have observed very closely for superficially i rather had  air  admiring you” said bernard “it  very superficial” “you don’t mean that for after all   just what my admiration my interest  you  not they  deep they  latent they  not superficialthey  subterranean” “you  contradicting yourself  i am perfectly consistent” said angela “your sentiments  so well hidden  i supposed i displeased you” “i remember   baden you used  contradict yourself” bernard answered “you have  terrible memory” “don’t call  terrible   sees everything now   charming lightin  light  this understanding  we have  last arrived at which seems  shine backwardto shine full  those baden days” “have we  last arrived   understanding” she asked   grave directness which bernard thought  most beautiful thing  had ever seen “it only depends upon you”  declared  then  broke out again into  protestation  passionate tenderness “don’t put me off this time”  cried “you have had time  think about it you have had time  get over  surprise  shock i love you  i offer you everything  belongs  me  this world” as she looked  him  her dark clear eyes weighing this precious vow  yet not committing herself“ah you don’t forgive me”  murmured she gazed  him   same solemn brightness “what have i  forgive you” this question seemed  him enchanting he reached forward  took her hands  if mrs vivian had come  she would have seen him kneeling  her daughter’s feet but mrs vivian remained  seclusion  bernard saw her only  next time  came “i am very happy because i think my daughter  happy” she said “and what do you think  me” “i think you  very clever you must promise me   very good  her” “i am clever enough  promise that” “i think you  good enough  keep it” said mrs vivian she looked  happy  she said  her happiness gave her  communicative confidential tendency “it  very strange how things come abouthow  wheel turns round” she went on “i suppose there  no harm  my telling you  i believe she always cared  you” “why did n’t you tell me before” said bernard  almost filial reproachfulness “how could i i don’t go about  world offering my daughter  peopleespecially  indifferent people” “at baden you did n’t think i  indifferent you  afraid  my not being indifferent enough” mrs vivian colored “ah  baden i   little too anxious” “too anxious i should n’t speak  your daughter” said bernard laughing “at baden” mrs vivian went on “i had views but i have n’t any nowi have given them up” “that makes your acceptance  me very flattering” bernard exclaimed laughing still more gaily “i have something better” said mrs vivian laying her fingertips  his arm “i have confidence” bernard did his best  encourage this gracious sentiment   seemed  him  there  something yet   done  implant  more firmly  angela’s breast “i have  confession  make  you”  said  her one day “i wish you would listen  it” “is  something very horrible” angela asked “something very horrible indeed i once did you  injury” “an injury” she repeated   tone which seemed  reduce  offence  contemptible proportions  simple vagueness  mind about it “i don’t know what  call it” said bernard “a poor servicean illturn” angela gave  shrug or rather  imitation   shrug  she  not  shrugging person “i never knew it” “i misrepresented you  gordon wright” bernard went on “why do you speak  me  him” she asked rather sadly “does  displease you” she hesitated  little “yes  displeases me if your confession  anything  do  him i would rather not hear it” bernard returned   subject another timehe had plenty  opportunities he spent  portion  every day   company  these dear women  these days   happiest  his life the autumn weather  warm  soothing  quartier  still deserted   uproar   great city which seemed  hundred miles away reached them through  dense october air   softened  muffled sound the evenings however  growing cool  before long they lighted  first fire   season  mrs vivian’s heavily draped little chimneypiece on this occasion bernard sat there  angela watching  bright crackle   wood  feeling   charm  winter nights had begun these two young persons  alone together   gathering dusk    hour before dinner before  lamp had been lighted “i insist upon making you my confession” said bernard “i shall  very unhappy until you let me do it” “unhappy you   happiest  men” “i lie upon roses if you will but this memory this remorse   folded roseleaf i  completely mistaken about you  baden i thought all manner  evil  youor  least i said it” “men  dull creatures” said angela “i think they are so much so that  i look back upon  time there  some things i don’t understand even now” “i don’t see why you should look back people  our position  supposed  look forward” “you don’t like those baden days yourself” said bernard “you don’t like  think  them” “what  wonderful discovery” bernard looked  her  moment   brightening firelight “what part   you tried  play there” angela shook her head “men  dull creatures” “i have already granted that  i am eating humble pie  asking   explanation” “what did you say  me” angela asked after  silence “i said you   coquette remember  i am simply historical” she got up  stood  front   fire having her hand   chimneypiece  looking down   blaze for some moments she remained there bernard could not see her face “i said you   dangerous woman  marry”  went  deliberately “i said  because i thought it i gave gordon  opinion about youit   very unfavorable one i could n’t make you outi thought you  playing  double part i believed  you  ready  marry him  yet i sawi thought i saw”  bernard paused again “what did you see”  angela turned toward him “that you  encouraging meplaying  me” “and you did n’t like that” “i liked  immenselyfor myself but did n’t like   gordon  i must do myself  justice  say  i thought more  him than  myself” “you   excellent friend” said angela simply “i believe i was and i am so still” bernard added she shook her head sadly “poor mr wright” “he   dear good fellow” said bernard “thoroughly good  dear doubtless  his wife  affectionate blanche” “you don’t like himyou don’t like her” said bernard “those  two very different matters i am very sorry  mr wright” “you need n’t  that he  doing very well” “so you have already informed me but i am sorry  him all  same” “that does n’t answer my question” bernard exclaimed   certain irritation “what part  you playing” “what part do you think” “have n’t i told you i gave  up long ago” angela stood  her back   fire looking  him her hands  locked behind her “did  ever strike you  my position  baden   charming oneknowing  i had been handed over  you   put under  microscopelike  insect   pin stuck through it” “how   world did you know it i thought we  particularly careful” “how can  woman help knowing such  thing she guesses itshe discovers   instinct especially if she   proud woman” “ah” said bernard “if pride   source  information you must   prodigy  knowledge” “i don’t know  you  particularly humble”  girl retorted “the meekest  most submissive  her sex would not have consented  have such  bargain   made about hersuch  trick played upon her” “my dearest angela   no bargainno trick” bernard interposed “it   clumsy trickit   bad bargain” she declared “at any rate i hated iti hated  idea  your pretending  pass judgment upon me  your having come  baden   purpose it   if mr wright had been buying  horse  you had undertaken  put me through my paces” “i undertook nothingi declined  undertake” “you certainly made  study  meand i  determined you should get your lesson wrong i determined  embarrass  mislead  defeat you or rather i did n’t determine i simply obeyed  natural impulse  selfdefencethe impulse  evade  fierce light  criticism i wished  put you   wrong” “you did  all very well you put me admirably   wrong” “the only justification  my doing   all  my doing  well” said angela “you  justified then you must have hated me fiercely” she turned her back  him  stood looking   fire again “yes there  some things  i did  can  accounted  only   intense aversion” she said this so naturally   spite   certain theory   touched upon  few pages back bernard   good deal bewildered he rose   sofa where  had been lounging  went  stood beside her  moment then  passed his arm round her waist  murmured  almost timorous “really” “i don’t know what you  trying  make me say” she answered he looked down  her   moment   held her close  him “i don’t see after all why i should wish  make you say it it would only make my remorse more acute” she  musing  her eyes   fire    moment she made no answer then  if her attention  returning “are you still talking about your remorse” she asked “you see i put  very strongly” “that i   horrid creature” “that you  not  woman  marry” “ah my poor bernard” said angela “i can’t attempt  prove  you  you  not inconsistent” the month  september drew   close  she consented  fix  day  their wedding the last  october   moment selected   selection  almost all   wanting  bernard’s happiness i say “almost”  there   solitary spot  his consciousness which felt numb  deadunpervaded   joy  which  rest  his spirit seemed  thrill  tingle the removal  this hard grain   sweet savour  life  needed  complete his felicity bernard felt   had made  necessary excision when   end   month  wrote  gordon wright  his engagement he had been putting off  performance  this duty  day  dayit seemed so hard  accomplish  gracefully he did    end very briefly  struck him  this   best

 week after his writing the letter contained  postscript“captain lovelock comes  us” chapter xxiv bernard prepared  gordon’s arrival  paris which according  his letter would take place   few days he  not intending  stop  england blanche desired  proceed immediately   french capital  confer  her manmilliner after which   probable  they would go  italy or   east   winter “i have given her  choice  rome or  nile” said gordon “but she tells me she does n’t care  fig where we go” i say  bernard prepared  receive his friends  i mean   prepared morallyor even intellectually materially speaking  could simply hold himself  readiness  engage  apartment   hotel   go  meet them   station he expected  hear  gordon  soon  this interesting trio should reach england but  first notification  received came   parisian hotel it came  him   shape   very short note   morning shortly before lunch     effect  his friends had alighted   rue de la paix  night before “we  tired  i have slept late” said gordon “otherwise you should have heard  me earlier come  lunch if possible i want extremely  see you” bernard  course made  point  going  lunch in  short  time  possible  found himself  gordon’s sittingroom   hotel middlesex the table  laid   midday repast   gentleman stood  his back   door looking out   window as bernard came in this gentleman turned  exhibited  ambrosial beard  symmetrical shape  monocular appendage  captain lovelock the captain screwed his glass into his eye  greeted bernard  his usual fashionthat is  if  had parted  him overnight “oh good morning beastly morning  n’t

trying  carry out their ideas  lunching that ‘s wright’s character you know  ‘s always trying  carry out some idea when i am abroad i go    foreign breakfast myself you may depend upon  they had better give up trying  do this sort  thing  this hour” captain lovelock  more disposed  conversation than bernard had known him before his discourse  old had been languid  fragmentary  our hero had never heard him pursue  train  ideas through so many involutions to bernard’s observant eye indeed  captain   altered man his manner betrayed  certain restless desire   agreeable  anticipate judgmenta disposition  smile   civil  entertain his auditor  tendency  move about  look out   window    clock he struck bernard   trifle nervousas less solidly planted  his feet than when  lounged along  baden gravelwalks   side  his usual companiona lady  whom apparently his admiration  still considerable bernard  curious  see whether  would ring  bell  inquire into  delay attending  service  lunch but before this sentiment rather idle under  circumstances  gratified blanche passed into  room   neighboring apartment to bernard’s perception blanche  least  always blanche she   person  whom  would not have occurred  him  expect any puzzling variation   tone  her little soft thin voice instantly rang  his ear like  echo  yesterday’s talk he had already remarked  himself  after however long  interval one might see blanche she reappeared   air  familiarity this   some sense indeed  proof   agreeable impression she made  she looked exceedingly pretty  she now suddenly stopped  seeing our two gentlemen  gave  little cry  surprise “ah i did n’t know you  here they never told me have you been waiting  long time how d’ ye do you must think we  polite” she held out her hand  bernard smiling very graciously at captain lovelock she barely glanced “i hope you  very well” she went   longueville “but i need n’t ask that you ‘re  blooming   rose what   world  happened  you you look so brilliantso fresh can you say    manthat  looks fresh or can you only say  about butter  eggs” “it depends upon  man” said captain lovelock “you can’t say   man ‘s fresh who spends his time  running about after you” “ah  you here” cried blanche  another little cry  surprise “i did n’t notice youi thought you   waiter this  what  calls running about after me” she added  bernard “coming  breakfast without being asked how queerly they have arranged  table” she went on gazing  her little elevated eyebrows  this piece  furniture “i always thought   paris if they could n’t do anything else they could arrange  table i don’t like   allthose horrid little dishes  each side don’t you think those things ought   off  table mr longueville i don’t like  see  lot  things i ‘m not eating and i told them  have some flowerspray where   flowers do they call those things flowers they look  if they had come out   landlady’s bonnet mr longueville do look  those objects” “they  not like methey  not very fresh” laughed bernard “it ‘s no great matterwe have not got  eat them” growled captain lovelock “i should think you would expect towith  luncheon you usually make” rejoined blanche “since you  here though i did n’t ask you you might  well make yourself useful will you  so good   ring  bell if gordon expects  we  going  wait another quarter   hour  him  exaggerates  patience   longsuffering wife if you  very curious  know what   about   writing letters  way   change he writes about eighty  day his correspondents must  strong people it ‘s  lucky thing  me  i am married  gordon if i  not  might write  meto me  whom  ‘s  misery  have  answer even  invitation  dinner to begin with i don’t know how  spell if captain lovelock ever boasts    had letters  me you may know  ‘s  invention he  never had anything but telegramsthree telegramsthat i sent him  america about  pair  slippers   had left  our house   i did n’t know what  do with captain lovelock’s slippers  no trifle  have  one’s handson one’s feet i suppose i ought  say for telegrams  spelling does n’t matter  people   office correct itor if they don’t you can put  off  them i never see anything nowadays but gordon’s back” she went on  they took their places  table“his noble broad back   sits writing his letters that ‘s my principal view  my husband i think  now we   paris i ought  have  portrait    one   great artists it would  such  characteristic pose i have quite forgotten his face  i don’t think i should know it” gordon’s face however presented itself just  this moment  came  quickly  his countenance flushed   pleasure  meeting his old friend again he had  sunscorched look   traveller who  just crossed  atlantic   smiled  bernard  his honest eyes “don’t think me  great brute  not being here  receive you”  said   clasped his hand “i  writing  important letter  i put   myself  this way ‘if i interrupt my letter i shall have  come back  finish it whereas if i finish  now i can have all  rest   day  spend  him’ so i stuck     end  now we can  inseparable” “you may  sure gordon reasoned  out” said blanche while her husband offered his hand  silence  captain lovelock “gordon’s reasoning   fine  other people’s feeling” declared bernard who  conscious   desire  say something very pleasant  gordon  who did not  all approve  blanche’s little ironical tone about her husband “and bernard’s compliments  better than either” said gordon laughing  taking his seat  table “i have been paying him compliments” blanche went on “i have been telling him  looks so brilliant so bloomingas if something had happened  him  if  had inherited  fortune he must have been doing something very wicked   ought  tell us all about it  amuse us i am sure you   dreadful parisian mr longueville remember  we  three dull virtuous people exceedingly bored  each other’s society  wanting  hear something strange  exciting if  ‘s  little improper  won’t spoil it” “you certainly  looking uncommonly well” said gordon still smiling across  table  his friend “i see what blanche means” “my dear gordon  ‘s  great event” his wife interposed “it ‘s  good deal  pretend certainly”  went on smiling always  his red face  his blue eyes “but this  no great credit  me because bernard’s superb condition would strike any one you look  if you  going  marry  lord mayor’s daughter” if bernard  blooming his bloom  this juncture must have deepened   so doing indeed have contributed  even brighter tint  his expression  salubrious happiness it  one   rare occasions  his life when     loss   verbal expedient “it ‘s  great match”  nevertheless murmured jestingly “you must excuse my inflated appearance” “it  absorbed you so much  you have had no time  write  me” said gordon “i expected  hear  you after you arrived” “i wrote  you  fortnight agojust before receiving your own letter you left new york before my letter reached it” “ah   have crossed us” said gordon “but now  we have your society i don’t care your letters  course  delightful but   still better” in spite  this sympathetic statement bernard cannot  said  have enjoyed his lunch   thinking  something else  lay before him    not agreeable he  like  man who   acrobatic feat  performa wide ditch  leap  high pole  climband who   presentiment  fractures  bruises fortunately   not obliged  talk much  mrs gordon displayed even more than her usual vivacity rendering her companions  graceful service  lifting  burden  conversation  their shoulders “i suppose you  surprised  see us rushing out here so suddenly” she observed   course   repast “we had said nothing about  when you last saw us  i believe we  supposed  tell you everything ain’t we i certainly have told you  great many things  there  some  them i hope you have n’t repeated i have no doubt you have told them all over paris but i don’t care what you tell  parisparis  n’t so easily shocked captain lovelock does n’t repeat what i tell him i set him up   model  discretion i have told him some pretty bad things    liked them so much   kept them all  himself i say my bad things  captain lovelock  my good things  other people  does n’t know  difference    perfectly content” “other people  well often don’t know  difference” said gordon gravely “you ought always  tell us which  which” blanche gave her husband  little impertinent stare “when i am not appreciated” she said   attempt  superior dryness “i am too proud  point  out i don’t know whether you know  i ‘m proud” she went on turning  gordon  glancing  captain lovelock “it ‘s  good thing  know i suppose gordon  say  i ought   too proud  point  out but what  you  do when no one  any imagination you have  grain or two mr longueville but captain lovelock  n’t  speck as  gordon je n’en parle pas but even you mr longueville would never imagine  i am  interesting invalidthat we  travelling  my delicate health the doctors have n’t given me up but i have given them up i know i don’t look  if i  out  health but  ‘s because i always try  look my best my appearance proves nothingabsolutely nothing do you think my appearance proves anything captain lovelock” captain lovelock scrutinized blanche’s appearance   fixed  solemn eye  then  replied “it proves you  very lovely” blanche kissed her fingertips  him  return  this compliment “you only need  give captain lovelock  chance” she rattled on “and    clever  any one that ‘s what i like  do  my friendsi like  make chances  them captain lovelock  like my dear little blue terrier  i left  home if i hold out  stick   jump over it he won’t jump without  stick but  soon  i produce   knows what    do he looks    moment  then  gives his little hop he knows   have  lump  sugar  captain lovelock expects one  well dear captain lovelock shall i ring   lump would n’t   touching garcon un morceau de sucre pour monsieur le capitaine but what i give monsieur le capitaine  moral sugar i usually administer   private   shall have  good big morsel when you go away” gordon got up turning  bernard  looking  his watch “let us go away   case”  said smiling “and leave captain lovelock  receive his reward we  go  take  walk we  go up  champs elysees good morning monsieur le capitaine” neither blanche nor  captain offered any opposition  this proposal  bernard took leave  his hostess  joined gordon who had already passed into  antechamber chapter xxv gordon took his arm  they gained  street they strolled   direction   champs elysees “for  little exercise   good deal  talk  ‘s  pleasantest place” said gordon “i have  good deal  say i have  good deal  ask you” bernard felt  familiar pressure  his friend’s hand   rested  his arm   seemed  him never  have lain there  so heavy  weight it held him fastit held him  account  seemed  physical symbol  responsibility bernard  not reassured  hearing  gordon had  great deal  say   expected  sudden explosion  bitterness   subject  blanche’s irremediable triviality the afternoon   lovely onethe day   perfect example   mellowest mood  autumn the air  warm  filled   golden haze which seemed  hang about  bare parisian trees  if   tender impulse  drape their nakedness a fine day  paris brings out  wonderfully bright  appreciative multitude  strollers  loungers   liberal spaces   champs elysees   this occasion filled  those placid votaries  inexpensive entertainment who abound   french capital the benches  chairs   edge   great avenue exhibited  dense fraternity  gazers  up  down  broad walk passed  slowmoving  easily pleased pedestrians gordon  spite  his announcement   had  good deal  say confined himself  first  superficial allusions  bernard after  while had  satisfaction  perceiving    not likely   moment  strike  note  conjugal discord he appeared indeed  feel no desire  speak  blanche  any manner whatever he fell into  humor   hour   scene looked   crowd talked about trifles he remarked  paris   wonderful place after all    little glimpse   parisian picture   capital thing   change said   very glad they had come    his part   willing  stay three months “and what have you been doing  yourself”  asked “how have you been occupied  what  you meaning  do” bernard said nothing   moment  gordon presently glanced  his face  see why   silent bernard looking askance met his companion’s eyes  then resting his own upon them  stopped short his heart  beating    question  saying  gordon outright “i have been occupied  becoming engaged  angela vivian” but  could n’t say it  yet  must say something he tried  invent something but  could think  nothing  still gordon  looking  him “i am so glad  see you”  exclaimed  want  something better   blushedhe felt foolish  felt falseas  said it “my dear bernard” gordon murmured gratefully  they walked on “it ‘s very good  you  say that i am very glad we  together again i want  say something”  added   moment “i hope you won’t mind it” bernard gave  little laugh  his companion’s scruples  gordon continued “to tell  truth   sometimes seemed  me  we  not so good friends  we used  bethat something had come between usi don’t know what i don’t know why i don’t know what  call  but  sort  lowering   temperature i don’t know whether you have felt it or whether   been simply  fancy  mine whatever  may have been  ‘s all over  n’t it we  too old friendstoo good friendsnot  stick together of course  rubs  life may occasionally loosen  cohesion but   very good  feel that   little direct contact  may easily  reestablished is n’t  so but we should n’t reason about these things one feels them   ‘s enough” gordon spoke  his clear cheerful voice  bernard listened intently it seemed  him there   undertone  pain  effort  his companion’s speech      unhappy man trying   wise  make  best  things “ah  rubs  lifethe rubs  life” bernard repeated vaguely “we must n’t mind them” said gordon   conscientious laugh “we must toughen our hides or   worst we must plaster up our bruises but why should we choose this particular place  hour  talking   pains  life”  went on “are we not   midst   pleasures i mean henceforth  cultivate  pleasures what  yours just now bernard is n’t  supposed   paris one must amuse one’s self how have you been amusing yourself” “i have been leading  very quiet life” said bernard “i notice  ‘s what people always say when they have been particularly dissipated what have you done whom have you seen  one knows” bernard  silent  moment “i have seen some old friends  yours”  said  last “i have seen mrs vivian  her daughter” “ah” gordon made this exclamation  then stopped short bernard looked  him but gordon  looking away his eyes had caught some one   crowd bernard followed  direction they had taken  then gordon went on “talk   devilexcuse  adage are not those  ladies  question” mrs vivian  her daughter were  fact seated among  great many other quiet people   couple  hired chairs   edge   great avenue they  turned toward our two friends  when bernard distinguished them   welldressed multitude they  looking straight  gordon wright “they see you” said bernard “you say   if i wished  run away” gordon answered “i don’t want  run away   contrary i want  speak  them” “that ‘s easily done” said bernard  they advanced   two ladies mrs vivian  her daughter rose  their chairs  they came they had evidently rapidly exchanged observations  had decided   would facilitate their interview  gordon wright  receive him standing he made his way  them through  crowd blushing deeply   always did when excited then  stood there bareheaded shaking hands  each  them   fixed smile   nothing apparently  say bernard watched angela’s face she  giving his companion  beautiful smile mrs vivian  delicately cordial “i  sure   you” said gordon  last “we  just talking  you” “did mr longueville deny   we” asked mrs vivian archly “after we had supposed  we had made  impression  him” “i knew you   pariswe    act  talking  you” gordon went on “i am very glad  see you” bernard had shaken hands  angela looking  her intently   her eyes  his own met them  seemed  him  there   gleam  mockery at whom  she mockingat gordon or  himself bernard  uncomfortable enough not  care   mocked but  felt even more sorry  gordon should be “we also knew you  comingmr longueville had told us” said mrs vivian “and we have been expecting  pleasure  seeing blanche dear little blanche” “dear little blanche  immediately come  see you” gordon replied “immediately we hope” said mrs vivian “we shall  so very glad” bernard perceived  she wished  say something soothing  sympathetic  poor gordon having it   supposed  her conscience that after having once encouraged him  regard himself  indispensable in  capacity  soninlaw  her happiness she should now present  him  spectacle   felicity which had established itself without his aid “we  so very much interested  your marriage” she went on “we thought  soso delightful” gordon fixed his eyes   ground   moment “i owe  partly  you”  answered “you had done so much  blanche you had so cultivated her mind  polished her manners  her attractions  doubled  i fell  easy victim  them” he uttered these words   exaggerated solemnity  result  which   produce   moment  almost embarrassing silence bernard  rapidly becoming more  more impatient  his own embarrassment  now  exclaimed   loud  jovial voice “blanche makes victims   dozen i   victim last winter we  all victims” “dear little blanche” mrs vivian murmured again angela had said nothing she had simply stood there making no attempt  address herself  gordon  yet  no affectation  reserve or  indifference now she seemed  feel  impulse  speak  him “when blanche comes  see us you must  sure  come  her” she said   friendly smile gordon looked  her but  said nothing “we  so sorry  hear she  out  health” angela went on still gordon  silent  his eyes fixed  her expressive  charming face “it  not serious”  murmured  last “she used   so wellso bright” said angela who also appeared  have  desire  say something kind  comfortable gordon made no response  this  only looked  her “i hope you  well miss vivian”  broke out  last “very well thank you” “do you live  paris” “we have pitched our tent here   present” “do you like it” “i find  no worse than other places” gordon appeared  desire  talk  her but  could think  nothing  say talking  her   pretext  looking  her  bernard who thought she had never been so handsome    particular moment smiling  her troubled exlover could easily conceive  his friend should desire  prolong this privilege “have you been sitting here long” gordon asked thinking  something  last “half  hour we came out  walk  my mother felt tired it  time we should turn homeward” angela added “yes i am tired my daughter we must take  voiture if mr longueville   so good   find us one” said mrs vivian bernard professing great alacrity looked about him but  still lingered near his companions gordon had thought  something else “have you been  baden again” bernard heard him ask but  this moment bernard espied   distance  empty hackneycarriage crawling up  avenue    obliged  go  signal  it when  came back followed   vehicle  two ladies accompanied  gordon had come   edge   pavement they shook hands  gordon before getting into  cab  mrs vivian exclaimed “be sure you give our love  your dear wife” then  two ladies settled themselves  smiled their adieux   little victoria rumbled away   easy pace while bernard stood  gordon looking after it they watched   moment  then gordon turned  his companion he looked  bernard  some moments intently   singular expression “it  strange  me  see her”  said presently “i hope   not altogether disagreeable” bernard answered smiling “she  delightfully handsome” gordon went on “she   beautiful woman” “and  strange thing   she strikes me now so differently” gordon continued “i used  think her so mysteriousso ambiguous she seems   now so simple” “ah” said bernard laughing “that’s  improvement” “so simple  so good” gordon exclaimed bernard laid his hand  his companion’s shoulder shaking his head slowly “you must not think too much about that”  said “so simpleso goodso charming” gordon repeated “ah my dear gordon” bernard murmured but still gordon continued “so intelligent so reasonable so sensible” “have you discovered all   two minutes’ talk” “yes  two minutes’ talk i should n’t hesitate about her now” “it ‘s better you should n’t say that” said bernard “why should n’t i say it it seems  me  ‘s my duty  say it” “noyour duty lies elsewhere” said bernard “there  two reasons one   you have married another woman” “what difference does  make” cried gordon bernard made no attempt  answer this inquiry  simply went on “the other isthe other is” but here  paused “what   other” gordon asked “that i am engaged  marry miss vivian” and  this bernard took his hand off gordon’s shoulder gordon stood staring “to marry miss vivian” now  bernard had heard himself say it audibly distinctly loudly  spell  his apprehension seemed broken   went  bravely “we    married very shortly it  all come about within  few weeks it  seem  you very strangeperhaps you won’t like it that ‘s why i have hesitated  tell you” gordon turned pale    first time bernard had ever seen him do so evidently  did not like it he stood staring  frowning “why i thoughti thought”  began  last“i thought  you disliked her” “i supposed so too” said bernard “but i have got over that” gordon turned away looking up  great avenue into  crowd then turning back  said “i am very much surprised” “and you  not pleased” gordon fixed his eyes   ground  moment “i congratulate you  your engagement”  said  last looking up   face  seemed  bernard hard  unnatural “it  very good  you  say that but  course you can’t like it i  sure you would n’t like it but what could i do i fell  love  her  i could n’t run away simply  spare you  surprise my dear gordon” bernard added “you  get used  it” “very likely” said gordon dryly “but you must give me time” “as long  you like” gordon stood   moment again staring down   ground “very well then i  take my time”  said “goodbye” and  turned away  if  walk off alone “where  you going” asked bernard stopping him “i don’t knowto  hotel anywhere to try  get used  what you have told me” “don’t try too hard   come  itself” said bernard “we shall see” and gordon turned away again “do you prefer  go alone” “very muchif you  excuse me” “i have asked you  excuse  greater want  ceremony” said bernard smiling “i have not done so yet” gordon rejoined  marching off  mingled   crowd bernard watched him till  lost sight  him  then dropping into  first empty chair   saw  sat  reflected  his friend liked  quite  little   had feared chapter xxvi bernard sat thinking   long time  first   good deal  mortificationat last   good deal  bitterness he felt angry  last but   not angry  himself he  displeased  poor gordon   gordon’s displeasure he  uncomfortable    vexed  his discomfort it formed  seemed  him no natural part  his situation  had had no glimpse     book  fate where  registered   fair blank page his betrothal   charming girl that gordon should  surprised  even  little shocked  annoyedthis  his right  his privilege bernard had been prepared  that  had determined  make  best  it but  must not go too far there  limits   morsel  humble pie    disposed  swallow something  gordon’s air  figure   went off   huff looking vicious  dangerousyes   positively his lookleft  sinister impression  bernard’s mind and after  while made him glad  take refuge  being angry one would like  know what gordon expected par exemple did  expect bernard  give up angela simply  save him  shock or  back out  his engagement  way   ideal reparation no   too absurd and if gordon had  wife  his own why   name  justice should not bernard have one being angry   relief but   not exactly  solution  bernard  last leaving his place where   hour or two  had been absolutely unconscious  everything  went  around him wandered about  some time  deep restlessness  irritation at one moment  thought  going back  gordon’s hotel  see him  explain but then  became aware    too angry  thatto say nothing  gordon’s being too angry also and moreover  there  nothing  explain he   marry angela vivian    very simple factit needed no explanation was  so wonderful so inconceivable  incident so unlikely  happen he went   always did  sunday  dine  mrs vivian   seemed  him   perceived   two ladies some symptoms   discomposure which had  same origin  his own bernard  this occasion  dinner failed  make himself particularly agreeable  ate fastas if  had no idea what   eating  talked little every now  then his eyes rested  some time upon angela   strange eagerly excited expression  if   looking her over  trying  make up his mind about her afresh this young lady bore his inscrutable scrutiny   deal  superficial composure but she  also silent  she returned his gaze  time  time   air  unusual anxiety she  thinking  course  gordon bernard said  himself   woman’s first meeting  after years   exlover must always make  certain impression upon her gordon however had never been  lover  if bernard noted angela’s gravity   not because  felt jealous “she  simply sorry  him”  said  himself    time  had finished his dinner  began  come back  him    sorry too mrs vivian  probably sorry  well  she had  slightly confused  preoccupied looka look  which even   midst  his chagrin bernard extracted some entertainment it  mrs vivian’s intermittent conscience  had been reminded  one   lapses her meeting  gordon wright had recalled  least exemplary episode  her lifethe time when she whispered mercenary counsel   ear   daughter who sat grave  pale looking  her  eyes  wondered mrs vivian blushed  little now when she met bernard’s eyes   remind herself  she  after all  virtuous woman talked  much  possible about superior  harmless thingsthe beauty   autumn weather  pleasure  seeing french papas walking about  sunday  their progeny  their hands  peculiarities   pulpitoratory   country  exemplified   discourse   protestant pasteur whom she had been  hear   morning when they rose  table  went back into her little drawingroom she left her daughter alone  awhile  bernard the two  standing together before  fire bernard watched mrs vivian close  door softly behind her then looking   moment  his companion “he  furious”  announced  last “furious” said angela “do you mean mr wright” “the amiable reasonable gordon he takes  very hard” “do you mean about me” asked angela “it ‘s not  you  ‘s furious  course    me he won’t let me off easily” angela looked   moment   fire “i am very sorry  him” she said  last “it seems  me i am  one   pitied” said bernard “and i don’t see what compassion you  all people   world owe him” angela again rested her eyes   fire then presently looking up “he liked me very much” she remarked “all  more shame  him” cried bernard “what do you mean” asked  girl  her beautiful stare “if  liked you why did  give you up” “he did n’t give me up” “what do you mean please” asked bernard staring back  her “i sent him awayi refused him” said angela “yes but you thought better  it  your mother had persuaded you  if  should ask you again you had better accept him then     backed outin consequence  what i said  him  his return  england” she shook her head slowly   strange smile “my poor bernard you  talking very wildly he did ask me again” “that night” cried bernard “the night  came back  englandthe last time i saw him until today” “after i had denounced you” our puzzled hero exclaimed frowning portentously “i am sorry  let you know  small effect  your words” bernard folded his hands togetheralmost devoutlyand stood gazing  her   long inarticulate murmur  satisfaction “ah then i did n’t injure youi did n’t deprive you   chance” “oh sir  intention  your part   same” angela exclaimed “then all my uneasiness all my remorse  wasted”  went on but she kept  same tone   tender archness only gave  greater sweetness  his sense  relief “it   very small penance  you  pay” “you dismissed him definitely    why  vanished” asked bernard wondering still “he gave me another ‘chance’  you elegantly express it  i declined  take advantage  it” “ah well now” cried bernard “i am sorry  him” “i  very kindvery respectful” said angela “i thanked him   bottom  my heart i begged his pardon very humbly   wrongif wrong  wasthat i  doing him i did n’t   least require  him   should leave baden  seven o’clock  next morning i had no idea   would do so     reason  i insisted  my mother  we ourselves should go away when we went i knew nothing about his having gone  i supposed   still there i did n’t wish  meet him again” angela gave this information slowly softly  pauses between  sentences  if she  recalling  circumstances   certain effort  meanwhile bernard  his transfigured face  his eyes fixed upon her lips  moving excitedly about  room “well  can’t accuse me then”  broke out again “if what i said had no more effect upon him than that i certainly did him no wrong” “i think you  rather vexed  did n’t believe you” said angela “i confess i don’t understand it he had all  air  it he certainly had not  air   man who  going  rush off  give you  last proof  his confidence” “it  not  proof  confidence” said angela “it had nothing  do  me it   between himself  you    proof  independence he did believe you more or less  what you said fell   his own impressionsstrange impressions  they were poor man at  same time  i say  liked me too   out  his liking me  all his trouble came he caught himself   act  listening  you too credulouslyand  seemed  him unmanly  dishonorable the sensation brought    reaction   prove  himself   such  matter  could  influenced  nobody  marched away  hour after  had talked  you and   teeth  his perfect mistrust confirmed  your account  my irregularitiesheaven forgive you bothagain asked me   his wife but  hoped i would refuse” “ah” cried bernard “the recreant he deservedhe deserved” “that i should accept him” angela asked smiling still bernard  so much affected  this revelation  seemed  him  make such  difference  his own responsibility   lift such  weight off his conscience   broke out again into  liveliest ejaculations  relief “oh i don’t care  anything now  i can do what i please gordon may hate me  i shall  sorry  him but  ‘s not my fault  i owe him no reparation no no i am free” “it ‘s only i who am not i suppose” said angela “and  reparation must come  me if   unhappy i must take  responsibility” “ah yes  course” said bernard kissing her “but why should   unhappy” asked angela “if i refused him   what  wanted” “he  hard  please” bernard rejoined “he  got  wife  his own” “if blanche does n’t please him   certainly difficult”  angela mused  little “but you told me  other day  they  getting  so well” “yes i believe i told you” bernard answered musing  little too “you  not attending  what i say” “no i am thinking  something elsei am thinking  what    made you refuse him  way   last after you had let your mother hope” and bernard stood there smiling  her “don’t think any more you  not find out”  girl declared turning away “ah   cruel  you  let me think i  wrong all these years”  went on “and   time since you meant  refuse him you might have been more frank  me” “i thought my fault had been  i  too frank” “i  densely stupid  you might have made me understand better” “ah” said angela “you ask  great deal   girl” “why have you let me go  so long thinking  my deluded words had had  effect upon gordonfeeling  i had done you  brutal wrong it  real  me  wrongand i have told you   pangs   shame which  so many months   cost me why have you never undeceived me until today  then only  accident” at this question angela blushed  little then she answered smiling “it  my vengeance” bernard shook his head “that won’t doyou don’t mean it you never caredyou  too proud  care  when i spoke  you about my fault you did n’t even know what i meant you might have told me therefore  my remorse  idle  what i said  gordon had not been   smallest consequence    rupture had come  yourself” for some time angela said nothing then  last she gave him one   deeply serious looks  which her face  occasionally ornamented “if you want really  know thencan’t you see  your remorse seemed  me connected   certain way  your affection  sort  guarantee  it you thought you had injured some one or other   seemed   mixed up  your loving me  therefore i let  alone” “ah” said bernard “my remorse  all gone  yet i think i love you about  much  ever so you see how wrong you  not  tell me” “the wrong  you i don’t care about it  very true i might have told you  mr wright’s sake it would perhaps have made him look better but  you never attacked him  deserting me  seemed needless  me  defend him” “i confess” said bernard “i am quite  sea about gordon’s look   matter is  looking better nowor   looking worse you put  very well just now i  attending  you though you said i  not if  hoped you would refuse him  whom  his quarrel  present and why   so cool  me  months after we parted  baden if   his state  mind why should  accuse me  inconsistency” “there  something  it after all   woman can understand i don’t know whether  man can he hoped i would refuse him  yet when i had done so   vexed after  while his vexation subsided   married poor blanche but  learning today  i had accepted you  flickered up again i suppose   natural enough but  won’t  serious” “what  not  serious my dear” asked mrs vivian who had come back   drawingroom  who apparently could not hear   attribute  question  wanting  any direction without some alarm “shall i tell mamma bernard” said angela “ah my dear child i hope  ‘s nothing  threatens your mutual happiness” mamma murmured  gentle earnestness “does  threaten our mutual happiness bernard”  girl went on smiling “let mrs vivian decide whether we ought  let  make us miserable” said bernard “dear mrs vivian you   casuist  this   nice case” “is  anything about poor mr wright”  elder lady inquired “why do you say ‘poor’ mr wright” asked bernard “because i am sadly afraid   not happy  blanche” “how did you discover thatwithout seeing them together” “well perhaps you  think me very fanciful” said mrs vivian “but     way  looked  angela he  such  expressive face” “he looked  me very kindly mamma” angela observed “he regularly stared my daughter in any one else i should have said   rude but his situation  so peculiar  one could see   admired you still” and mrs vivian gave  little soft sigh “ah she  thinking   thirty thousand  year” bernard said  himself “i am sure i hope  admires me still”  girl cried laughing “there  no great harm  that” “he  comparing you  blancheand   struck   contrast” “it could n’t have been  my favor if  ‘s  question  being looked at blanche bears  better than i” “poor little blanche” murmured mrs vivian sweetly “why did you tell me   so happy  her” angela asked turning  bernard abruptly bernard gazed  her  moment  his eyebrows raised “i never saw any one ask such sudden questions”  exclaimed “you can answer me  your leisure” she rejoined turning away “it  because i adored you” “you would n’t say   your leisure” said  girl mrs vivian stood watching them “you who  so happy together you ought  think kindly  others who  less fortunate” “that  very true mrs vivian  i have never thought  any one so kindly  i have  gordon   last year” angela turned round again “is blanche so very bad then” “you  see  yourself” “ah no” said mrs vivian “she  not bad she  only very light i am so glad she    near us again i think  great deal can  done  association we must help her angela i think we helped her before” “it  also very true  she  light mrs vivian” bernard observed “and if you could make her  little heavier i should  tremendously grateful” bernard’s prospective motherinlaw looked  him  little “i don’t know whether you  laughing  mei always think you are but i shall not give up blanche  that i never give up any one  i have once tried  help blanche  come back  me” mrs vivian had hardly spoken when  sharp little vibration  her doorbell  heard   hall bernard stood   moment looking   door   drawingroom “it  poor gordon come  make  scene”  announced “is  what you meanthat  opposed your marriage” asked mrs vivian   frightened air “i don’t know what  proposes  do  blanche” said bernard laughing there  voices   hall angela had been listening “you say she  come back  you mamma” she exclaimed “here she  arrived” chapter xxvii at  same moment  door  thrown open  mrs gordon appeared   threshold   gentleman behind her blanche stood  instant looking into  lighted room  hesitatingflushed  little smiling extremely pretty “may i come in” she said “and may i bring  captain lovelock” the two ladies  course fluttering toward her  every demonstration  hospitality drew her into  room while bernard proceeded  greet  captain who advanced   certain awkward  bashful majesty almost sweeping  his great stature mrs vivian’s humble ceiling there   tender exchange  embraces between blanche  her friends   charming visitor losing no time began  chatter  her usual volubility mrs vivian  angela made her companion graciously welcome but blanche begged they would n’t mind himshe had only brought him   watchdog “his place    rug” she said “captain lovelock go  lie down   rug” “upon my soul there  nothing else but rugs  these french places”  captain rejoined looking round mrs vivian’s salon “which rug do you mean” mrs vivian had remarked  blanche    very kind  her  come first  blanche declared  she could not have laid her head  her pillow before she had seen her dear mrs vivian “do you suppose i would wait because i am married” she inquired   keen little smile  her charming eyes “i am not so much married  that i can tell you do you think i look much  if i  married  no one  bring me here tonight but captain lovelock” “i am sure captain lovelock   very gallant escort” said mrs vivian “oh   not afraidthat is   not afraid   journey though  lay all through those dreadful wild champs elysees but when we arrived   afraid  come into come up here captain lovelock  so modest you knowin spite  all  success  had  america he  tell you about  success  had  america  quite makes up   defeat   british army   revolution they  defeated   revolution  british  n’t they i always told him so but  insists they  not ‘how do we come   free then’ i always ask him ‘i suppose you admit  we  free’ then  becomes personal  says  i am free enough certainly but  ‘s  general fact i mean i wish you would tell him about  general fact i think  would believe you because

stayed three months  us  you had  chance  see i don’t ask you  seriously because you never tell  truth i always do so i  say i am not  good wife and then  breach  too big  i am too little oh i am too little mrs vivian i know i am too little i am  smallest woman living gordon can scarcely see me   microscope  i believe    most powerful one  america he  going  get another here   one   things  came abroad for perhaps   do better i do tell  truth don’t i mrs vivian i have  merit if i have n’t any other you once told me so  baden you said you could say one thing  me  any ratethat i did n’t tell fibs you  very nice  me  baden” blanche went on  her little intent smile laying her hand    her hostess “you see i have never forgotten it so  keep up my reputation i must tell  truth about gordon he simply said  would n’t comevoila he gave no reason   did n’t send you any pretty message he simply declined   went out somewhere else so you see   n’t writing letters i don’t know where  can have gone perhaps   gone   theatre i know   n’t proper  go   theatre  sunday evening but they say charity begins  home   gordon’s does n’t begin  home perhaps  does n’t begin anywhere i told him  if  would n’t come  me i would come alone   said i might do  i chosethat   not   humor  making visits i wanted  come  you very much i had been thinking about  all day  i am so fond   visit like this   evening without being invited then i thought perhaps you had  salondoes n’t every one  paris have  salon i tried  have  salon  new york only gordon said  would n’t do he said   n’t  our manners is this  salon tonight mrs vivian oh do say  is i should like so much  see captain lovelock   salon by good fortune  happened  have been dining  us so i told him  must bring me here i told you i would explain captain lovelock” she added “and i hope you think i have made  clear” the captain had turned very red during this wandering discourse he sat pulling his beard  shifting  position which  his stalwart person  had taken up   little gilded chaira piece  furniture which every now  then gave  delicate creak “i always understand you well enough till you begin  explain”  rejoined   candid even if embarrassed laugh “then  jove i ‘m quite   woods you see such  lot more  things than most people does n’t she miss vivian” “blanche   fine imagination” said angela smiling frankly   charming visitor when blanche  fairly adrift upon  current  her articulate reflections    habit  her companionsindeed    sort  tacit agreement among themsimply  make  circle  admire they sat about  looked  heryawning perhaps  little  times but   whole very well entertained  often exchanging  smiling commentary  each other she looked  them smiled  them each  succession every one had his turn  this always helped  give blanche  audience incoherent  aimless  much  her talk was she never looked prettier than   attitude  improvisationor rather i should say than   hundred attitudes which she assumed  such  time perpetually moving she  yet constantly graceful  while she twisted her body  turned her head  charming hands  never ceased  gesticulate  little conscious brilliant eyes  looked everywhere  onceeyes  seemed  chatter even faster than her lipsshe made you forget  nonsense she poured forth or think   only   part  her personal picturesqueness the thing   regular performance  practice  unlimited chatter had made her perfect she rested upon her audience  held  together   sight  half  dozen pairs  amused  fascinated faces led her  one piece  folly  another on this occasion her audience  far  failing her  they  all greatly interested captain lovelock’s interest  we know  chronic  our three other friends  much occupied   matter  which blanche  intimately connected bernard   listened  her smiling mechanically  not encouraged he remembered what mrs vivian had said shortly before she came in    not pleasant  him  think  gordon had been occupied half  day  contrasting  finest girl   world  this magnified butterfly the contrast  sufficiently striking  angela sat there near her very still bending her handsome head  little  her hands crossed  her lap   her lips  kind but inscrutable smile mrs vivian    sofa next  blanche one  whose hands when   not otherwise occupied she occasionally took into her own “dear little blanche” she softly murmured  intervals these few remarks represent  longer pause than mrs gordon often suffered  occur she continued  deliver herself upon  hundred topics   hardly matters where we take her up “i have n’t  least idea what we  going  do i have nothing  say about  whatever gordon tells me every day i must decide  then i ask captain lovelock what  thinks because you see  always thinks  great deal captain lovelock says  does n’t care  figthat   go wherever i go so you see  does n’t carry us very far i want  settle  some place where captain lovelock won’t go but  won’t help me  all i think   look better  him not  follow us don’t you think   look better mrs vivian not  i care   least where we goor whether captain lovelock follows us either i don’t take any interest  anything mrs vivian don’t you think   very sad gordon may go anywhere  likesto st petersburg or  bombay” “you might go   worse place than bombay” said captain lovelock speaking   authority   angloindian rich  reminiscences blanche gave him  little stare “ah well  ‘s knocked   head from  way you speak  it i think you would come after us   more i think  that  more i see  would n’t do but we have got  go  some southern place because i am very unwell i have n’t  least idea what ‘s  matter  me  neither  any one else but  does n’t make any difference it ‘s settled  i am out  health one might  well  out     it  all  advantage  is if you  out  health  any rate you can come abroad it  gordon’s discoveryhe ‘s always making discoveries you see  ‘s because i ‘m so silly  can always put  down  my being  invalid what i should like  do mrs vivian would   spend  winter  youjust sitting   sofa beside you  holding your hand it would  rather tiresome  you but i really think  would  better  me than anything else i have never forgotten how kind you   me before my marriagethat summer  baden you  everything  meyou  captain lovelock i am sure i should  happy if i never went out  this lovely room you have got  so beautifully arrangedi mean  do my own room just like  when i go home and you have got such lovely clothes you never used  say anything about it but you  angela always had better clothes than i are you always so quiet  seriousnever talking about chiffonsalways reading some wonderful book i wish you would let me come  stay  you if you only ask me gordon would  too delighted he would n’t have  trouble about me any more he could go  live over   latin quarterthat ‘s  desire  his heartand think  nothing but old bottles i know   n’t very good manners  beg   invitation” blanche went on smiling   gentler radiance “but when  ‘s  question  one’s health one wants  keep one’s self alivedoes n’t one one wants  keep one’s self going it would  so good  me mrs vivian  would really  very good  me” she had turned round more  more  her hostess  she talked   last she had given both her hands  mrs vivian  sat looking  her   singular mixture  earnestness  jocosity it  hard  know whether blanche  expressing  real desire or  momentary caprice  whether this abrupt little petition    taken seriously or treated merely   dramatic pose   series  more or less effective attitudes her smile had become almost  grimace she  flushed she showed her pretty teeth but there   little passionate quiver  her voice “my dear child” said mrs vivian “we should  delighted  have you pay us  visit  we should  so happy if we could do you any good but i am afraid you would very soon get tired  us  i ought  tell you frankly  our little home   bea broken up you know there    aa change”  good lady continued   hesitation which apparently came   sense  walking  uncertain ground while she glanced   smile  bernard  angela blanche sat there  her little excited yet innocenttoo innocentstare her eyes followed mrs vivian’s they met bernard’s   instant   some reason  this moment bernard flushed he rose quickly  walked away   window where  stood looking out into  darkness “the devilthe devil”  murmured  himself “she does n’t even know we    marriedgordon  n’t been able  trust himself  tell her” and this fact seemed pregnant  evidence   gordon’s state  mind  did not appear  simplify  situation after  moment while bernard stood there  his back turnedhe felt rather awkward  foolishhe heard blanche begin  her little surprised voice “ah you  going away you  going  travel but  ‘s charming we can travel together you  not going  travel what then  you going  do you  going back  america ah but you must n’t do that  soon  i come abroad  ‘s not nice or friendly mrs vivian  your poor little old blanche you  not going back  america ah then i give  up what ‘s  great mystery is  something about angela there  always  mystery about angela i hope you won’t mind my saying it my dear but i  always afraid  you my husbandhe admires you so much you knowhas often tried  explain you  me but i have never understood what  you going  do now are you going into  convent are you going  beaah” and suddenly quickly interrupting herself mrs gordon gave  long wondering cry bernard heard her spring  her feet   two other ladies rise  their seats captain lovelock got up  well bernard heard him knock over his little gilded chair there   pause during which blanche went through  little mute exhibition  amazement  pleasure bernard turned round  receive half  dozen quick questions “what  you hiding away for what  you blushing for i never saw you do anything like  before why do you look so strange  what  you making me say angela   trueis there something like that” without waiting   answer  this last question blanche threw herself upon mrs vivian “my own mrs vivian” she cried “is she married” “my dear blanche” said bernard coming forward “has not gordon told you angela  i  not married but we hope   before long gordon only knew  this morning we ourselves have only known   short time there  no mystery about it  we only want your congratulations” “well i must say you have been very quiet about it” cried blanche “when i  engaged i wrote you all  letter” “by jove she wrote  me” observed captain lovelock angela went  her  kissed her “your husband does n’t seem  have explained me very successfully” mrs gordon held bernard’s intended   moment  arm’s length  both her hands looking  her  eyes  real excitement  wonder then she folded her   prolonged  exaggerated embrace “why did n’t  tell mewhy did n’t  tell me” she presently began “he  had all day  tell me    very cruel  him  let me come here without knowing it could anything  more absurdmore awkward you don’t think  ‘s awkwardyou don’t mind it ah well you  very good but i like it angelai like  extremely immensely i think  ‘s delightful  i wonder  never occurred  me has  been going  long ah  course   been going on did n’t  begin  baden  did n’t i see  there do you mind my alluding  that at baden we  all so mixed up  one could n’t tell who  attentive  whom but bernard  been very faithful my dear i can assure you  that when    america  would n’t look  another woman i know something about that he stayed three months  my house   never spoke  me now i know why mr bernard but you might have told me   time the reason  certainly good enough i always want  know why you know why gordon never told me  instance  ‘s what i want  know” blanche refused  sit down again she declared  she  so agitated  this charming news  she could not  quiet   she must presently take her departure meanwhile she congratulated each  her friends half  dozen times she kissed mrs vivian again she almost kissed bernard she inquired about details she longed  hear all about angela’s “things” of course they would stop   wedding but meantime she must  very discreet she must not intrude too much captain lovelock addressed  angela  few fragmentary but wellintentioned sentences pulling his beard  fixing his eyes   doorknoban implement which presently turned  his manly fist   opened  door  his companion  withdraw blanche went away   flutter  ejaculations  protestations which left our three friends  mrs vivian’s little drawingroom standing looking  each other   door closed behind her “it certainly would have been better taste  him  tell her” said bernard frowning “and not let other people see how little communication there  between them it  mortified her” “poor mr wright had his reasons” mrs vivian suggested  then she ventured  explain “he still cares  angela    painful  him  talk about her marrying some one else” this had been bernard’s own reflection    no more agreeable  mrs vivian presented it though angela herself seemed indifferent  itseemed indeed not  hear it  if she  thinking  something else “we must simply marry  soon  possible tomorrow if necessary” said bernard  some causticity “that ‘s  best thing we can do  every one when once angela  married gordon  stop thinking  her he  never permit his imagination  hover about  married woman i am very sure  that he does n’t approve   sort  thing     same law  himself   other people” “it does n’t matter” said angela simply “how do you mean my daughter  does n’t matter” “i don’t feel obliged  feel so sorry  him now” “now pray what  happened i am more sorry than ever since i have heard poor blanche’s dreadful tone about him” the girl  silent  moment then she shook her head lightly “her toneher tone dearest mother don’t you see she  intensely  love  him” chapter xxviii this observation struck bernard  extremely ingenious  worthy  his mistress’s fine intelligence  greeted   enthusiasm  thought     next twelve hours the more  thought    more felicitous  seemed  him   went  mrs vivian’s  next day almost   express purpose  saying  angela that decidedly she  right he  admitted  his old friend  little femme de chambre who had long since bestowed upon him definitively her confidence     antechamber  heard  voice   gentleman raised  talking  some emphasis come  him   salon  paused  moment looking  her   interrogative eye “yes” said mrs vivian’s attendant “i must tell monsieur frankly  another gentleman  there moreover what does  matter monsieur would perceive   himself” “has  been here long” asked bernard “a quarter   hour it probably does n’t seem long   gentleman” “is  alone  mademoiselle” “he asked  mademoiselle only i introduced him into  salon  mademoiselle after conversing  little while  madame consented  receive him they have been alone together  i have told monsieur since about three o’clock madame   her own apartment the position  monsieur” added this discriminating woman “certainly justifies him  entering  salon” bernard  quite  this opinion    moment more  had crossed  threshold   little drawingroom  closed  door behind him angela sat there   sofa leaning back  her hands clasped  her lap  her eyes fixed upon gordon wright who stood squarely before her  if  had been making her  resolute speech her face wore  look  distress almost  alarm she kept her place but her eyes gave bernard  mute welcome gordon turned  looked  him slowly  head  foot bernard remembered   good deal  vividness  last look his friend had given him   champs elysees  day before   saw  some satisfaction  this  not exactly  repetition   expression  cold horror it   question however whether  horror  changed   better poor gordon looked intensely sad  grievously wronged the keen resentment had faded  his face but  immense reproach  therea heavy helpless appealing reproach bernard saw   had not  scene  violence  dreadand yet when  perceived what  coming  would almost have preferred violence gordon did not offer him his hand  before bernard had had time  say anything began  speak again  if   going   what  had been saying  angela “you have done me  great wrongyou have done me  cruel wrong i have been telling   miss vivian i came  purpose  tell her i can’t really tell her i can’t tell her  details  ‘s too painful but you know what i mean i could n’t stand  any longer i thought  going awaybut i could n’t do that i must come  say what i feel i can’t bear  now” this outbreak   passionate sense  injury   man habitually so undemonstrative so little disposed  call attention  himself had   something  once   touching   terrible bernard   instant felt almost bewildered  asked himself whether  had not after all been  monster  duplicity he  guilty   weakness  taking refuge  what  called i believe  legal phrase  sideissue “don’t say all this before angela”  exclaimed   kind  artificial energy “you know she  not   least  fault    can only give her pain the thing  between ourselves” angela  sitting there looking up  both  men “i like  hear it” she said “you have  singular taste” bernard declared “i know  ‘s between ourselves” cried gordon “and  miss vivian  not  fault she  only too lovely too wise too good it  you  i    faulthorribly  fault you see i admit it  you don’t i never dreamed  i should live  say such things  this  you but i never dreamed you would do what you have done it ‘s horrible most horrible  such  difference  this should come between two men who believed themselvesor whom i believed  leastthe best friends   world for    differenceit ‘s  great gulf  nothing  ever fill  up i must say so i can’t help it you know i don’t express myself easily so if i break out this way you may know what i feel i know    pain  miss vivian  i beg her  forgive me she  so much  forgive  she can forgive that too i can’t pretend  accept it i can’t sit down  let  pass and then   n’t only my feelings  ‘s  right  ‘s  justice i must say  her  you have no right  marry her  beg  her  listen  me  let you go” “my dear gordon  you crazy” bernard demanded   energy which this time  least  sufficiently real “very likely i am crazy i am crazy  disappointment   bitterness  what i have lost add    wretchedness  what i have found” “ah don’t say that mr wright” angela begged he stood   instant looking  her but not heeding her words “will you listen  me again will you forget  wrong i did youmy stupidity  folly  unworthiness will you blot out  past  let me begin again i see you  clearly now   light   window will you give me another chance” angela turned away her eyes  covered her face  her hands “you do pain me” she murmured “you go too far” said bernard “to what position does your extraordinary proposal relegate your wife” gordon turned his pleading eyes  his old friend without  ray  concession but   moment  hesitated “don’t speak  me  my wife i have no wife” “ah poor girl” said angela springing up   sofa “i am perfectly serious” gordon went on addressing himself again  her “no after all i am not crazy i see only too clearlyi see what should be when people see that you call them crazy bernard  no righthe must give you up if you really care  him you should help him he    very false position you should n’t wish  see him  such  position i can’t explain  youif   even  my own sake but bernard must have told you   not possible    not told you” “i have told angela everything gordon” said bernard “i don’t know what you mean  your having done me  wrong”  girl exclaimed “if   told you theni may say it in listening  him  believing him” “but you did n’t believe me” bernard exclaimed “since you immediately went  offered yourself  miss vivian” “i believed you all  same when did i ever not believe you” “the last words i ever heard  mr wright  words   deepest kindness” said angela she spoke  such  serious tender grace  gordon seemed stirred  his depths again “ah give me another chance”  moaned the poor girl could not help her tone      same tone  she continued “if you think so well  me try   reasonable” gordon looked  her slowly shaking his head “reasonablereasonable yes you have  right  say that  you  full  reason but so am i what i ask  within reasonable limits” “granting your happiness  lost” said bernard“i say  only   argumentis   ground  your wishing  deprive me  mine” “it  not yoursit  mine  you have taken you put me off my guard  then you took it yours  elsewhere  you  welcome  it” “ah” murmured bernard giving him  long look  turning away “it  well  you  i am willing still  regard you  my best friend” gordon went on more passionately  angela “he put me off my guardi can’t call  anything else i know i gave him  great chancei encouraged him urged him tempted him but when once  had spoken  should have stood  it he should n’t have had two opinionsone  me  one  himself he put me off my guard it  because i still resisted him  i went  you again  last time but i  still afraid  you   my heart i believed him as i say i always believed him   his great influence upon me he   cleverest  most intelligent  most brilliant  men i don’t think   grain less than i ever thought it”  continued turning again  bernard “i think  only  more  i don’t wonder  you find  woman  believe it but what have you done but deceive me it  just my belief  your intelligence  reassured me when miss vivian refused me  second time  i left baden    first   sort  relief but there came back  better feelinga feeling faint compared  this feeling  today but strong enough  make me uneasy   fill me  regret to quench my regret i kept thinking  what you had said   kept me quiet your word had such weight  me” “how many times more would you have wished   refused  how many refusals would have been required  give me my liberty” asked bernard “that question means nothing because you never knew  i had again offered myself  miss vivian” “no you told me very little considering all  you made me tell you” “i told you beforehand  i should do exactly  i chose” “you should have allowed me  same liberty” “liberty” cried gordon “had n’t you liberty  range  whole world over could n’t  have found  thousand other women” “it  not  me  think so” said angela smiling  little gordon looked  her  moment “ah you cared  him   first”  cried “i had seen him before i ever saw you” said  girl bernard suppressed  exclamation there seemed  flash through these words  sort  retrospective confession which told him something  she had never directly told him she blushed  soon  she had spoken  bernard found  beauty  this  which  brightness blinded him   awkward aspect   fact she had just presented  gordon at this fact gordon stood staring then  last  apprehended itlargely “ah then  had been  plot between you”  cried out bernard  angela exchanged  glance  pity “we had met  five minutes  had exchanged  few words before i came  baden it   italyat siena it   simple accident  i never told you” bernard explained “i wished  nothing should  said about it” said angela “ah you loved him” gordon exclaimed angela turned awayshe went   window bernard followed her  three seconds  his eyes then  went on “if   so i had no reason  suppose it you have accused me  deceiving you but i deceived only myself you say i put you off your guard but you should rather say you put me  mine it was thanks  that  i fell into  most senseless  most brutal  delusions the delusion passed awayit had contained  germ  better things i saw my error  i bitterly repented  it    day you  married i felt free” “ah yes i have no doubt you waited  that” cried gordon “it may interest you  know  my marriage   miserable failure” “i am sorry  hear itbut i can’t help it” “you have seen   your own eyes you know all about it  i need n’t tell you” “my dear mr wright” said angela pleadingly turning round “in heaven’s name don’t say that” “why should n’t i say it i came here  purpose  say it i came here   intentionwith  plan you know what blanche isyou need n’t pretend  kindness  me  you don’t you know what  precious what  inestimable wife she must make mehow devoted how sympathetic she must be  what  household blessing  every hour   day bernard can tell you all about ushe  seen us   sanctity  our home” gordon gave  bitter laugh  went on   same strange serious air  explaining his plan “she despises me she hates me she cares no more  me than   button  her gloveby which i mean  she does n’t care  hundredth part  much you may say   serves me right   i have got what i deserve i married her because she  silly i wanted  silly wife i had  idea you  too wise oh yes  ‘s what i thought  you blanche knew why i picked her out  undertook  supply  article required heaven forgive her she  certainly kept her engagement but you can imagine how  must have made her like meknowing why i picked her out she  disappointed me all  same i thought she had  heart but    mistake it does n’t matter though because everything  over between us” “what do you mean everything  over” bernard demanded “everything   over   few weeks then i can speak  miss vivian seriously” “ah i am glad  hear this  not serious” said bernard “miss vivian wait  few weeks” gordon went on “give me another chance then then    perfectly right i shall  free” “you speak  if you  going  put  end  your wife” “she  rapidly putting  end  herself she means  leave me” “poor unhappy man do you know what you  saying” angela murmured “perfectly i came here  say it she means  leave me  i mean  offer her every facility she  dying  take  lover  she  got  excellent one waiting  her bernard knows whom i mean i don’t know whether you do she  ready  take one three months after our marriage it  really very good  her  have waited all this time but i don’t think she can go more than  week or two longer she  recommended  southern climate  i am pretty sure    course  another ten days i may count upon their starting together   shores   mediterranean the shores   mediterranean you know  lovely  i hope they  do her  world  good as soon  they have left paris i  let you know  then you   course admit that virtually i am free” “i don’t understand you” “i suppose you  aware” said gordon “that we have  advantage  being natives   country  which marriages may  legally dissolved” angela stared then softly “are you speaking   divorce” “i believe   what they call it” gordon answered gazing back  her  his densely clouded blue eyes “the lawyers do   you  if she goes away  lovelock nothing   more simple than  me  have  arranged” angela stared i say  bernard  staring too then  latter turning away broke out into  tremendous irrepressible laugh gordon looked  him  moment then  said  angela   deeper tremor  his voice “he  my dearest friend” “i never felt more devoted  you than  this moment” bernard declared smiling still gordon had fixed his sombre eyes upon  girl again “do you understand me now” angela looked back  him  some instants “yes” she murmured  last “and  you wait  give me another chance” “yes” she said   same tone bernard uttered  quick exclamation but angela checked him   glance  gordon looked  one  them   other “can i trust you” gordon asked “i  make you happy” said angela bernard wondered what under  sun she meant but  thought  might safely add “i  abide  her choice” gordon actually began  smile “it won’t  long i think two or three weeks” angela made no answer  this she fixed her eyes   floor “i shall see blanche  often  possible” she presently said “by all means the more you see her  better you  understand me” “i understand you very well now but you have shaken me very much  you must leave me i shall see you alsooften” gordon took up his hat  stick  saw  bernard did not do  same “and bernard”  exclaimed “i shall ask him  leave paris” said angela “will you go” “i  do what angela requests” said bernard “you have heard what she requests  ‘s  you  come now” “ah you must  least allow me  take leave” cried bernard gordon went   door  when  had opened   stood   while holding   looking  his companions then “i assure you she won’t  long”  said  angela  rapidly passed out the others stood silent till they heard  outer door   apartment close behind him “and now please  elucidate” said bernard folding his arms angela gave no answer  some moments then she turned upon him  smile which appeared incongruous but which her words presently helped  explain “he  intensely  love  his wife” chapter xxix this statement  very effective but  might well have seemed  first  do more credit  her satiric powers than  her faculty  observation this   light  which  presented itself  bernard but little  little  she amplified  text  grew  think well  it   last   quite ready  place it   triumph  sagacity   level   other discovery which she had made  evening before   regard  which his especial errand today had been  congratulate her afresh it brought him however less satisfaction than  appeared  bring  his clever companion for   observed plausibly enough gordon  quite out  his head and this being  case  what importance   secret  his heart “the secret  his heart   condition  his head  one   same thing” said angela “he  turned upside down   wretchedly false position    got into  his wife she  treated him badly but   treated her wrongly they   love  each other  yet they both do nothing but hide it he  not   least  love  poor menot today any more than   three years ago he thinks  is because   full  sorrow  bitterness  because  news  our engagement  given him

no”  girl went on   generous ardor  her face following further  train  her argument which she appeared  find extremely attractive “i know what you  going  say  i deny it i am not fanciful or sophistical or irrational  i know perfectly what i am about men  so stupid  ‘s only women  have real discernment leave me alone  i shall do something blanche  silly yes very silly but she  not so bad  her husband accused her  being  those dreadful words which   live  repent of she  wise enough  care  him greatly  bottom   feel her little heart filled  rage  shame   does n’t appear  care  her if  would take her  little more seriouslyit ‘s  immense pity  married her because she  sillyshe would  flattered  it  she would try  deserve it no no no she does n’t  reality care  straw  captain lovelock i assure you i promise you she does n’t a woman can tell she   danger possibly  if her present situation  regards her husband lasts she might do something  horrid   said but she would do  out  spitenot out  affection   captain who must  got immediately out   way she only keeps him  torment her husband  make gordon come back  her she would drop him forever tomorrow” angela paused  moment reflecting   kindled eye “and she shall” bernard looked incredulous “how   be miss solomon” “you shall see when you come back” “when i come back pray where am i going” “you  leave paris   fortnightas i promised our poor friend” bernard gave  irate laugh “my dear girl you  ridiculous your promising   almost  childish  his asking it” “to play   child you must  childish just see  effect  this abominable passion  love which you have been crying up  me so by  operation gordon wright  most sensible man  our acquaintance  reduced   level  infancy if you  only go away i  manage him” “you certainly manage me pray where shall i go” “wherever you choose i  write  you every day” “that    inducement” said bernard “you know i have never received  letter  you” “i write  most delightful ones” angela exclaimed  she succeeded  making him promise  start  night  london she had just done so when mrs vivian presented herself   good lady  not  little astonished  being informed  his intention “you surely  not going  give up my daughter  oblige mr wright” she observed “upon my word i feel  if i were” said bernard “i  explain it dear mamma” said angela “it  very interesting mr wright  made  most fearful scene  state  things between him  blanche  dreadful” mrs vivian opened her clear eyes “you really speak  if you liked it” “she does like itshe told gordon so” said bernard “i don’t know what she  up to gordon  taken leave  his wits  wishes  put away his wife” “to put her away” “to repudiate her   historians say” “to repudiate little blanche” murmured mrs vivian  if she  struck   incongruity   operation “i mean  keep them together” said angela   firm decision her mother looked  her  admiration “my dear daughter i  assist you” the two ladies had such  air  mysterious competence   task they had undertaken   seemed  bernard  nothing  left  him but  retire into temporary exile he accordingly betook himself  london where  had social resources which would perhaps make exile endurable he found himself however little disposed  avail himself  these resources   treated himself  no pleasures but those  memory  expectation he ached   sense  his absence  mrs vivian’s deeply familiar skyparlor which seemed  him   time  most sacred spot  earthif  earth  could  calledand  consigned  those generous postal receptacles which ornament  their brilliant hue  london streetcorners

operations  regard  gordon “mamma  undertaken blanche” she wrote “and i am devoting myself  mr w it  really very interesting” she told bernard all about   detail   also found  interesting doubly so indeed   must  confessed   charming figure   mistress  his affections attempting  heal  great social breach  her light  delicate hands divided his attention pretty equally   distracted  distorted  almost ludicrous image  his old friend angela wrote  gordon had come back  see her  day after his first visit  had seemed greatly troubled  learning  bernard had taken himself off “it  because you insisted  it  course”  said “it  not  feeling  justice   himself” “i told him” said angela  her letter “that i had made  point  it but  we certainly ought  give you  little credit  it but i could n’t insist upon this  fear  sounding  wrong note  exciting afresh what i suppose  would  pleased  term his jealousy he asked me where you had gone  when i told him‘ah how  must hate me’  exclaimed ‘there you  quite wrong’ i answered ‘he feels  kindly  you asas i do’ he looked  if   no means believed this but indeed  looks  if  believed nothing  all he  quite upset  demoralized he stayed half  hour  paid me his visittrying hard  ‘please’ me again poor man     charming state  please  fair sex but if  does n’t please me  interests me more  more i make bold  say   you you would have said  would

me  these topics does not make him feel  bit more comfortable    must look elsewhere   remedy i said not  word about blanche” she spoke  blanche however  next time “he came again this afternoon” she said  her second letter “and  wore exactly  same face  yesterdaynamely  very unhappy one if i  not entirely too wise  believe his account  himself i might suppose    unhappy because blanche shows symptoms  not taking flight she  been  us  great dealshe  no idea what  going onand i can’t honestly say  she chatters any less than usual but she  greatly interested  certain shops  she  buying out

‘none whatever but she won’t come’ ‘on  contrary she says she will’ ‘she  pretend to up   last minute  then she  find  pretext  backing out’ ‘decidedly you think very ill  her’ i said ‘she hates me’  answered looking  me strangely ‘you say   every one’ i said ‘yesterday you said   bernard’ ‘ah  him there would  more reason’  exclaimed ‘i won’t attempt  answer  bernard’ i went on ‘but i  answer  blanche your idea  her hating you   miserable delusion she cares  you more than  any one   world you only misunderstand each other    little good   both sides you can easily get out  your tangle’ but  would n’t listen  me  stopped me short i saw i should excite him if i insisted so i dropped  subject but   not  long  shall listen  me” later she wrote  blanche had  fact “backed out”  would not come

began  another occasion “i hope you  not dying  ennui etc over here things  going soso he asked me yesterday  go  him   louvre  we walked about among  pictures  half  hour mamma thinks   very strange

“but last evening very latetoo late   visitorhe came in mamma had left  drawingroom  i  sitting alone i immediately saw  we had reached  crisis i thought  first   going  tell me  blanche had carried

  strand into one   theatres he had been gloomily pushing his way through  various london densitiesthe november fog  nocturnal darkness  jostling crowd he  too restless  do anything but walk   had

days  impatience  bereavement he gave little heed   play his thoughts  elsewhere and while they rambled his eyes wandered round  house suddenly   other side  it  beheld captain lovelock seated squarely  his orchestrastall but if bernard  not mistaken paying  little attention   stage   himself had done the captain’s eyes   true  fixed upon  scene his head  bent  little his magnificent beard rippled over  expanse  his shirtfront but bernard  not slow  see  his gaze  heavy  opaque  that though   staring   actresses their charms  lost upon him he saw that like himself poor lovelock had

inasmuch  causes even more imperious than those which had operated  his own case must have been   bottom  his sudden appearance  london on leaving  theatre however bernard found himself detained

our hero became aware   had been brought into contact  lovelock who  walking just beside him at  same moment lovelock noticed himlooked  him   instant  then looked away but  looked back again  next instant   two men then uttered  inarticulate  inexpressive exclamation which passes   sign  greeting among gentlemen   anglosaxon race  their moments  more acute selfconsciousness “oh  you here” said bernard “i thought you   paris” “no i ain’t  paris” lovelock answered  some dryness “tired   beastly hole” “oh i see” said bernard “excuse me while i put up my umbrella” he put up his umbrella   under it  next moment  saw  captain waving two fingers  him out   front   hansom when  returned  his hotel  found  his table  letter superscribed  gordon wright’s hand this communication ran  follows “i believe you  making  fool  me in heaven’s name come back  paris g w” bernard hardly knew whether  regard these few words   further declaration  war or   overture  peace but  lost no time  complying   summons they conveyed he started  paris  next morning    evening after  had removed  dust  his journey  swallowed  hasty dinner  rang  mrs vivian’s door this lady  her daughter gave him  welcome whichi  not say satisfied him but which  least did something toward soothing  still unhealed wounds  separation “and what   news  gordon”  presently asked “we have not seen him  three days” said angela “he  cured dear bernard  must be angela  been wonderful” mrs vivian declared “you should have seen mamma  blanche” her daughter said smiling “it  most remarkable” mrs vivian smiled too very gently “dear little blanche captain lovelock  gone  london” “yes  thinks   beastly hole ah no” bernard added “i have got  wrong” but  little mattered late  night  his return  his own rooms bernard sat gazing  his fire he had not begun  undress   thinking   good many things he    midst  his reflections when there came  rap  his door which  next moment  flung open gordon wright stood there looking  himwith  gaze which bernard returned   moment before bidding him  come in gordon came   came up  him then  held out his hand bernard took   great satisfaction his last feeling had been    very weary  this ridiculous quarrel     extreme relief  find   over “it  very good  you  go  london” said gordon looking  him  all  old serious honesty  his eyes “i have always tried  do what i could  oblige you” bernard answered smiling “you must have cursed me over there” gordon went on “i did  little as you  cursing me here   permissible” “that ‘s over now” said gordon “i came  welcome you back it seemed  me i could n’t lay my head  my pillow without speaking  you” “i am glad  get back” bernard admitted smiling still “i can’t deny that and i find you  i believed i should” then  added seriously“i knew angela would keep us good friends” for  moment gordon said nothing then  last “yes   purpose  did n’t matter which  us should marry her if  had been i”  added “she would have made you accept it” “ah i don’t know” bernard exclaimed “i am sure  it” said gordon earnestlyalmost argumentatively “she ‘s  extraordinary woman” “keeping you good friends  methat ‘s  great thing but  ‘s nothing  her keeping you good friends  your wife” gordon looked  bernard   instant then  fixed his eyes  some time   fire “yes    greatest  all things a man should value his wife he should believe  her he  taken her   should keep herespecially when there   great deal  good  her i   great fool  other day”  went on “i don’t remember what i said it  very weak” “it seemed  me feeble” said bernard “but   quite within  man’s rights    fool once   while  you had never abused   license” “well i have done    lifetimefor  lifetime” and gordon took up his hat he looked into  crown     moment  then  fixed his eyes  bernard’s again “but there  one thing i hope you won’t mind my saying i have come back  my old impression  miss vivian” “your old impression” and miss vivian’s accepted lover frowned  little “i mean  she ‘s not simple she ‘s very strange” bernard’s frown cleared away   sudden almost eager smile “say  once  you dislike her that  do capitally” gordon shook his head  he too almost smiled  little “it ‘s not true she ‘s very wonderful and if i did dislike her i should struggle  it it would never do  me  dislike your wife” after  had gone when  night  half over bernard lying awake  while gave  laugh   still darkness  this last sentence came back  him on  morrow  saw blanche   went  see gordon the latter  first  not  home but  had  quarter   hour’s talk  his wife whose powers  conversation
