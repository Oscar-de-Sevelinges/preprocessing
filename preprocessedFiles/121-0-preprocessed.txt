attachment    delicacy discretion originality  thought  literary taste which marked  reasonableness   attachment they met  appointment   isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend her first address naturally was “my dearest creature what can have made you so late i have been waiting  you  least this age” “have you indeed i am very sorry  it but really i thought i   very good time it  but just one i hope you have not been here long” “oh these ten ages  least i am sure i have been here this half hour but now let us go  sit down   other end   room  enjoy ourselves i have  hundred things  say  you in  first place i  so afraid  would rain this morning just  i wanted  set off  looked very showery   would have thrown me into agonies do you know i saw  prettiest hat you can imagine   shop window  milsom street just now—very like yours only  coquelicot ribbons instead  green i quite longed  it but my dearest catherine what have you been doing  yourself all this morning have you gone   udolpho” “yes i have been reading  ever since i woke  i am got   black veil” “are you indeed how delightful oh i would not tell you what  behind  black veil   world are not you wild  know” “oh yes quite what can  be but do not tell me—i would not  told upon any account i know  must   skeleton i am sure   laurentina’s skeleton oh i am delighted   book i should like  spend my whole life  reading it i assure you if  had not been  meet you i would not have come away    all  world” “dear creature how much i am obliged  you  when you have finished udolpho we  read  italian together  i have made out  list  ten or twelve more   same kind  you” “have you indeed how glad i am what  they all” “i  read you their names directly here they are  my pocketbook castle  wolfenbach clermont mysterious warnings necromancer   black forest midnight bell orphan   rhine  horrid mysteries those  last us some time” “yes pretty well but  they all horrid  you sure they  all horrid” “yes quite sure   particular friend  mine  miss andrews  sweet girl one   sweetest creatures   world  read every one  them i wish you knew miss andrews you would  delighted  her she  netting herself  sweetest cloak you can conceive i think her  beautiful   angel  i am so vexed   men  not admiring her i scold them all amazingly about it” “scold them do you scold them  not admiring her” “yes  i do there  nothing i would not do  those who  really my friends i have no notion  loving people  halves   not my nature my attachments  always excessively strong i told captain hunt  one  our assemblies this winter  if    tease me all night i would not dance  him unless  would allow miss andrews    beautiful   angel the men think us incapable  real friendship you know  i am determined  show them  difference now if i   hear anybody speak slightingly  you i should fire up   moment but   not  all likely  you  just  kind  girl    great favourite   men” “oh dear” cried catherine colouring “how can you say so” “i know you very well you have so much animation which  exactly what miss andrews wants  i must confess there  something amazingly insipid about her oh i must tell you  just after we parted yesterday i saw  young man looking  you so earnestly—i am sure    love  you” catherine coloured  disclaimed again isabella laughed “it  very true upon my honour but i see how  is you  indifferent  everybody’s admiration except   one gentleman who shall  nameless nay i cannot blame you”—speaking more seriously—“your feelings  easily understood where  heart  really attached i know very well how little one can  pleased   attention  anybody else everything  so insipid so uninteresting  does not relate   beloved object i can perfectly comprehend your feelings” “but you should not persuade me  i think so very much about mr tilney  perhaps i may never see him again” “not see him again my dearest creature do not talk  it i am sure you would  miserable if you thought so” “no indeed i should not i do not pretend  say  i  not very much pleased  him but while i have udolpho  read i feel  if nobody could make me miserable oh the dreadful black veil my dear isabella i am sure there must  laurentina’s skeleton behind it” “it  so odd  me  you should never have read udolpho before but i suppose mrs morland objects  novels” “no she does not she very often reads sir charles grandison herself but new books do not fall  our way” “sir charles grandison that   amazing horrid book   not i remember miss andrews could not get through  first volume” “it  not like udolpho  all but yet i think   very entertaining” “do you indeed you surprise me i thought  had not been readable but my dearest catherine have you settled what  wear  your head tonight i am determined  all events   dressed exactly like you the men take notice  that sometimes you know” “but  does not signify if they do” said catherine very innocently “signify oh heavens i make   rule never  mind what they say they  very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them  spirit  make them keep their distance” “are they well i never observed that they always behave very well  me” “oh they give themselves such airs they   most conceited creatures   world  think themselves  so much importance by  by though i have thought    hundred times i have always forgot  ask you what  your favourite complexion   man do you like them best dark or fair” “i hardly know i never much thought about it something between both i think brown—not fair and—and not very dark” “very well catherine that  exactly he i have not forgot your description  mr tilney—‘a brown skin  dark eyes  rather dark hair’ well my taste  different i prefer light eyes    complexion—do you know—i like  sallow better than any other you must not betray me if you should ever meet  one  your acquaintance answering  description” “betray you what do you mean” “nay do not distress me i believe i have said too much let us drop  subject” catherine  some amazement complied  after remaining  few moments silent    point  reverting  what interested her   time rather more than anything else   world laurentina’s skeleton when her friend prevented her  saying “for heaven’s sake let us move away  this end   room do you know there  two odious young men who have been staring  me this half hour they really put me quite out  countenance let us go  look   arrivals they  hardly follow us there” away they walked   book  while isabella examined  names   catherine’s employment  watch  proceedings  these alarming young men “they  not coming this way  they i hope they  not so impertinent   follow us pray let me know if they  coming i am determined i  not look up” in  few moments catherine  unaffected pleasure assured her  she need not  longer uneasy   gentlemen had just left  pumproom “and which way  they gone” said isabella turning hastily round “one   very goodlooking young man” “they went towards  churchyard” “well i am amazingly glad i have got rid  them and now what say you  going  edgar’s buildings  me  looking  my new hat you said you should like  see it” catherine readily agreed “only” she added “perhaps we may overtake  two young men” “oh never mind that if we make haste we shall pass  them presently  i am dying  show you my hat” “but if we only wait  few minutes there   no danger  our seeing them  all” “i shall not pay them any such compliment i assure you i have no notion  treating men  such respect that   way  spoil them” catherine had nothing  oppose against such reasoning  therefore  show  independence  miss thorpe  her resolution  humbling  sex they set off immediately  fast  they could walk  pursuit   two young men chapter  half  minute conducted them through  pumpyard   archway opposite union passage but here they  stopped everybody acquainted  bath may remember  difficulties  crossing cheap street  this point   indeed  street  so impertinent  nature so unfortunately connected   great london  oxford roads   principal inn   city   day never passes  which parties  ladies however important their business whether  quest  pastry millinery or even as   present case  young men  not detained  one side or other  carriages horsemen or carts this evil had been felt  lamented  least three times  day  isabella since her residence  bath  she  now fated  feel  lament  once more    very moment  coming opposite  union passage  within view   two gentlemen who  proceeding through  crowds  threading  gutters   interesting alley they  prevented crossing   approach   gig driven along  bad pavement   most knowinglooking coachman  all  vehemence  could most fitly endanger  lives  himself his companion  his horse “oh these odious gigs” said isabella looking up “how i detest them” but this detestation though so just   short duration  she looked again  exclaimed “delightful mr morland  my brother” “good heaven ’tis james”  uttered   same moment  catherine and  catching  young men’s eyes  horse  immediately checked   violence which almost threw him  his haunches   servant having now scampered up  gentlemen jumped out   equipage  delivered  his care catherine  whom this meeting  wholly unexpected received her brother   liveliest pleasure  he being   very amiable disposition  sincerely attached  her gave every proof  his side  equal satisfaction which  could have leisure  do while  bright eyes  miss thorpe  incessantly challenging his notice   her his devoirs  speedily paid   mixture  joy  embarrassment which might have informed catherine had she been more expert   development  other people’s feelings  less simply engrossed  her own  her brother thought her friend quite  pretty  she could do herself john thorpe who   meantime had been giving orders about  horses soon joined them   him she directly received  amends which  her due  while  slightly  carelessly touched  hand  isabella  her  bestowed  whole scrape  half  short bow he   stout young man  middling height who   plain face  ungraceful form seemed fearful  being too handsome unless  wore  dress   groom  too much like  gentleman unless   easy where  ought   civil  impudent where  might  allowed   easy he took out his watch “how long do you think we have been running   tetbury miss morland” “i do not know  distance” her brother told her    twentythree miles “threeandtwenty” cried thorpe “fiveandtwenty if    inch” morland remonstrated pleaded  authority  roadbooks innkeepers  milestones but his friend disregarded them all  had  surer test  distance “i know  must  fiveandtwenty” said he “by  time we have been doing it it  now half after one we drove out   innyard  tetbury   town clock struck eleven  i defy any man  england  make my horse go less than ten miles  hour  harness  makes  exactly twentyfive” “you have lost  hour” said morland “it  only ten o’clock when we came  tetbury” “ten o’clock it  eleven upon my soul i counted every stroke this brother  yours would persuade me out  my senses miss morland do but look  my horse did you ever see  animal so made  speed  your life” the servant had just mounted  carriage   driving off “such true blood three hours    half indeed coming only three  twenty miles look   creature  suppose  possible if you can” “he does look very hot   sure” “hot he had not turned  hair till we came  walcot church but look  his forehand look  his loins only see how  moves  horse cannot go less than ten miles  hour tie his legs    get on what do you think  my gig miss morland a neat one  not it well hung townbuilt i have not had   month it  built   christchurch man  friend  mine  very good sort  fellow  ran   few weeks till i believe   convenient  have done  it i happened just then   looking out  some light thing   kind though i had pretty well determined   curricle too but i chanced  meet him  magdalen bridge    driving into oxford last term ‘ah thorpe’ said he ‘do you happen  want such  little thing  this it   capital one   kind but i am cursed tired  it’ ‘oh d—’ said i ‘i am your man what do you ask’ and how much do you think  did miss morland” “i am sure i cannot guess  all” “curriclehung you see seat trunk swordcase splashingboard lamps silver moulding all you see complete  ironwork  good  new or better he asked fifty guineas i closed  him directly threw down  money   carriage  mine” “and i am sure” said catherine “i know so little  such things  i cannot judge whether   cheap or dear” “neither one nor t’other i might have got   less i dare say but i hate haggling  poor freeman wanted cash” “that  very goodnatured  you” said catherine quite pleased “oh d—— it when one   means  doing  kind thing   friend i hate   pitiful” an inquiry now took place into  intended movements   young ladies and  finding whither they  going   decided   gentlemen should accompany them  edgar’s buildings  pay their respects  mrs thorpe james  isabella led  way  so well satisfied   latter  her lot so contentedly  she endeavouring  ensure  pleasant walk  him who brought  double recommendation  being her brother’s friend  her friend’s brother so pure  uncoquettish  her feelings that though they overtook  passed  two offending young men  milsom street she  so far  seeking  attract their notice  she looked back  them only three times john thorpe kept  course  catherine and after  few minutes’ silence renewed  conversation about his gig “you  find however miss morland  would  reckoned  cheap thing  some people  i might have sold   ten guineas more  next day jackson  oriel bid me sixty  once morland   me   time” “yes” said morland who overheard this “but you forget  your horse  included” “my horse oh d—— it i would not sell my horse   hundred are you fond   open carriage miss morland” “yes very i have hardly ever  opportunity  being  one but i am particularly fond  it” “i am glad  it i  drive you out  mine every day” “thank you” said catherine  some distress   doubt   propriety  accepting such  offer “i  drive you up lansdown hill tomorrow” “thank you but  not your horse want rest” “rest he  only come three  twenty miles today all nonsense nothing ruins horses so much  rest nothing knocks them up so soon no no i shall exercise mine   average  four hours every day while i am here” “shall you indeed” said catherine very seriously “that   forty miles  day” “forty aye fifty  what i care well i  drive you up lansdown tomorrow mind i am engaged” “how delightful   be” cried isabella turning round “my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you  not have room   third” “a third indeed no no i did not come  bath  drive my sisters about  would   good joke faith morland must take care  you” this brought   dialogue  civilities between  other two but catherine heard neither  particulars nor  result her companion’s discourse now sunk   hitherto animated pitch  nothing more than  short decisive sentence  praise or condemnation   face  every woman they met  catherine after listening  agreeing  long  she could  all  civility  deference   youthful female mind fearful  hazarding  opinion   own  opposition     selfassured man especially where  beauty  her own sex  concerned ventured  length  vary  subject   question which had been long uppermost  her thoughts  was “have you ever read udolpho mr thorpe” “udolpho oh lord not i i never read novels i have something else  do” catherine humbled  ashamed  going  apologize  her question but  prevented her  saying “novels  all so full  nonsense  stuff there  not been  tolerably decent one come out since tom jones except the monk i read  t’other day but   all  others they   stupidest things  creation” “i think you must like udolpho if you   read it   so very interesting” “not i faith no if i read any  shall  mrs radcliffe’s her novels  amusing enough they  worth reading some fun  nature  them” “udolpho  written  mrs radcliffe” said catherine  some hesitation   fear  mortifying him “no sure  it aye i remember so  was i  thinking   other stupid book written   woman they make such  fuss about she who married  french emigrant” “i suppose you mean camilla” “yes that’s  book such unnatural stuff an old man playing  seesaw i took up  first volume once  looked  over but i soon found  would not do indeed i guessed what sort  stuff  must  before i saw it  soon  i heard she had married  emigrant i  sure i should never  able  get through it” “i have never read it” “you had no loss i assure you    horridest nonsense you can imagine there  nothing   world   but  old man’s playing  seesaw  learning latin upon my soul there  not” this critique  justness  which  unfortunately lost  poor catherine brought them   door  mrs thorpe’s lodgings   feelings   discerning  unprejudiced reader  camilla gave way   feelings   dutiful  affectionate son  they met mrs thorpe who had descried them  above   passage “ah mother how do you do” said he giving her  hearty shake   hand “where did you get  quiz   hat it makes you look like  old witch here  morland  i come  stay  few days  you so you must look out   couple  good beds somewhere near” and this address seemed  satisfy all  fondest wishes   mother’s heart  she received him   most delighted  exulting affection on his two younger sisters  then bestowed  equal portion  his fraternal tenderness   asked each  them how they did  observed  they both looked very ugly these manners did not please catherine but   james’s friend  isabella’s brother  her judgment  further bought off  isabella’s assuring her when they withdrew  see  new hat  john thought her  most charming girl   world   john’s engaging her before they parted  dance  him  evening had she been older or vainer such attacks might have done little but where youth  diffidence  united  requires uncommon steadiness  reason  resist  attraction  being called  most charming girl   world   being so very early engaged   partner   consequence  that when  two morlands after sitting  hour   thorpes set off  walk together  mr allen’s  james   door  closed  them said “well catherine how do you like my friend thorpe” instead  answering  she probably would have done had there been no friendship  no flattery   case “i do not like him  all” she directly replied “i like him very much  seems very agreeable” “he   goodnatured  fellow  ever lived  little   rattle but   recommend him  your sex i believe  how do you like  rest   family” “very very much indeed isabella particularly” “i am very glad  hear you say so she  just  kind  young woman i could wish  see you attached to she  so much good sense   so thoroughly unaffected  amiable i always wanted you  know her  she seems very fond  you she said  highest things  your praise  could possibly be   praise  such  girl  miss thorpe even you catherine” taking her hand  affection “may  proud of” “indeed i am” she replied “i love her exceedingly  am delighted  find  you like her too you hardly mentioned anything  her when you wrote  me after your visit there” “because i thought i should soon see you myself i hope you    great deal together while you   bath she   most amiable girl such  superior understanding how fond all  family   her she  evidently  general favourite  how much she must  admired  such  place  this—is not she” “yes very much indeed i fancy mr allen thinks her  prettiest girl  bath” “i dare say  does  i do not know any man who   better judge  beauty than mr allen i need not ask you whether you  happy here my dear catherine  such  companion  friend  isabella thorpe  would  impossible  you   otherwise   allens i am sure  very kind  you” “yes very kind i never  so happy before  now you  come    more delightful than ever how good    you  come so far  purpose  see me” james accepted this tribute  gratitude  qualified his conscience  accepting  too  saying  perfect sincerity “indeed catherine i love you dearly” inquiries  communications concerning brothers

“my dear creature i am afraid i must leave you your brother  so amazingly impatient  begin i know you  not mind my going away  i dare say john   back   moment  then you may easily find me out” catherine though  little disappointed had too much good nature  make any opposition   others rising up isabella had only time  press her friend’s hand  say “goodbye my dear love” before they hurried off the younger miss thorpes being also dancing catherine  left   mercy  mrs thorpe  mrs allen between whom she now remained she could not help being vexed   nonappearance  mr thorpe  she not only

leisure  saying it but  hindrance thrown   way   very speedy intimacy   frequent want  one or more  these requisites prevented their doing more than going through  first rudiments   acquaintance  informing themselves how well  other liked bath how much she admired  buildings  surrounding country whether she drew or played or sang  whether she  fond  riding  horseback the two dances  scarcely concluded before catherine found her arm gently seized  her faithful isabella who  great spirits exclaimed “at last i have got you my dearest creature i have been looking  you this hour what could induce you  come into this set when you knew i    other i have been quite wretched without you” “my dear isabella how   possible  me  get  you i could not even see where you were” “so i told your brother all  time—but  would not believe me do go  see  her mr morland said i—but all  vain—he would not stir  inch was not  so mr morland but you men  all so immoderately lazy i have been scolding him  such  degree my dear catherine you would  quite amazed you know i never stand upon ceremony  such people” “look   young lady   white beads round her head” whispered catherine detaching her friend  james “it  mr tilney’s sister” “oh heavens you don’t say so let me look  her this moment what  delightful girl i never saw anything half so beautiful but where  her allconquering brother is    room point him out  me this instant if  is i die  see him mr morland you  not  listen we  not talking about you” “but what  all this whispering about what  going on” “there now i knew how  would be you men have such restless curiosity talk   curiosity  women indeed ’tis nothing but  satisfied  you  not  know anything  all   matter” “and   likely  satisfy me do you think” “well i declare i never knew anything like you what can  signify  you what we  talking of perhaps we  talking about you therefore i would advise you not  listen or you may happen  hear something not very agreeable” in this commonplace chatter which lasted some time  original subject seemed entirely forgotten  though catherine  very well pleased  have  dropped   while she could not avoid  little suspicion   total suspension  all isabella’s impatient desire  see mr tilney when  orchestra struck up  fresh dance james would have led his fair partner away but she resisted “i tell you mr morland” she cried “i would not do such  thing  all  world how can you  so teasing only conceive my dear catherine what your brother wants me  do he wants me  dance  him again though i tell him     most improper thing  entirely against  rules it would make us  talk   place if we  not  change partners” “upon my honour” said james “in these public assemblies    often done  not” “nonsense how can you say so but when you men have  point  carry you never stick  anything my sweet catherine do support me persuade your brother how impossible  is tell him   would quite shock you  see me do such  thing now would not it” “no not  all but if you think  wrong you had much better change” “there” cried isabella “you hear what your sister says  yet you  not mind her well remember    not my fault if we set all  old ladies  bath   bustle come along my dearest catherine  heaven’s sake  stand  me” and off they went  regain their former place john thorpe   meanwhile had walked away  catherine ever willing  give mr tilney  opportunity  repeating  agreeable request which had already flattered her once made her way  mrs allen  mrs thorpe  fast  she could   hope  finding him still  them—a hope which when  proved   fruitless she felt  have been highly unreasonable “well my dear” said mrs thorpe impatient  praise  her son “i hope you have had  agreeable partner” “very agreeable madam” “i am glad  it john  charming spirits  not he” “did you meet mr tilney my dear” said mrs allen “no where  he” “he   us just now  said   so tired  lounging about    resolved  go  dance so i thought perhaps  would ask you if  met  you” “where can  be” said catherine looking round but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading  young lady   dance “ah he  got  partner i wish  had asked you” said mrs allen  after  short silence she added “he   very agreeable young man” “indeed  is mrs allen” said mrs thorpe smiling complacently “i must say it though i am his mother  there  not  more agreeable young man   world” this inapplicable answer might have been too much   comprehension  many but  did not puzzle mrs allen  after only  moment’s consideration she said   whisper  catherine “i dare say she thought i  speaking  her son” catherine  disappointed  vexed she seemed  have missed  so little  very object she had had  view  this persuasion did not incline her   very gracious reply when john thorpe came up  her soon afterwards  said “well miss morland i suppose you  i   stand up  jig  together again” “oh no i am much obliged  you our two dances  over and besides i am tired  do not mean  dance any more” “do not you then let us walk about  quiz people come along  me  i  show you  four greatest quizzers   room my two younger sisters  their partners i have been laughing  them this half hour” again catherine excused herself   last  walked off  quiz his sisters  himself the rest   evening she found very dull mr tilney  drawn away  their party  tea  attend   his partner miss tilney though

mrs allen whose vacancy  mind  incapacity  thinking  such   she never talked  great deal so she could never  entirely silent and therefore while she sat  her work if she lost her needle or broke her

therefore obliged  speak plainer “well ma’am what do you say  it can you spare me   hour or two shall i go” “do just  you please my dear” replied mrs allen   most placid indifference catherine took  advice  ran off  get ready in  very few minutes she reappeared having scarcely allowed  two others time enough  get through  few short sentences  her praise after thorpe had procured mrs allen’s admiration  his gig  then receiving her friend’s parting good wishes they both hurried downstairs “my dearest creature” cried isabella  whom  duty  friendship immediately called her before she could get into  carriage “you have been  least three hours getting ready i  afraid you  ill what  delightful ball we had last night i have  thousand things  say  you but make haste  get in  i long   off” catherine followed her orders  turned away but not too soon  hear her friend exclaim aloud  james “what  sweet girl she is i quite dote  her” “you  not  frightened miss morland” said thorpe   handed her in “if my horse should dance about  little  first setting off he will most likely give  plunge or two  perhaps take  rest   minute but   soon know his master he  full  spirits playful  can be but

“and no children  all” “no—not any” “a famous thing  his next heirs he  your godfather  not he” “my godfather no” “but you  always very much  them” “yes very much” “aye   what i meant he seems  good

 tired if i   stay here six months” “bath compared  london  little variety  so everybody finds out every year ‘for six weeks i allow bath  pleasant enough but beyond that    most tiresome place   world’ you would  told so  people  all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve  go away  last because they can afford  stay no longer” “well other people must judge  themselves  those who go  london may think nothing  bath but i who live   small retired village   country can never find greater sameness  such  place  this than  my own home  here   variety  amusements  variety  things   seen  done all day long which i can know nothing  there” “you  not fond   country” “yes i am i have always lived there  always been very happy but certainly there  much more sameness   country life than   bath life one day   country  exactly like another” “but then you spend your time so much more rationally   country” “do i” “do you not” “i do not believe there  much difference” “here you   pursuit only  amusement all day long” “and so i am  home—only i do not find so much  it i walk about here  so i do there but here i see  variety  people  every street  there i can only go  call  mrs allen” mr tilney  very much amused “only go  call  mrs allen”  repeated “what  picture  intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you  have more  say you   able  talk  bath   all  you did here” “oh yes i shall never   want  something  talk  again  mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always  talking  bath when i am  home again—i do like  so very much if i could but have papa  mamma   rest  them here i suppose i should  too happy james’s coming my eldest brother  quite delightful—and especially   turns out   very family we  just got so intimate   his intimate friends already oh who can ever  tired  bath” “not those who bring such fresh feelings  every sort    you do but papas  mammas  brothers  intimate friends   good deal gone by  most   frequenters  bath—and  honest relish  balls  plays  everyday sights  past  them” here their conversation closed  demands   dance becoming now too importunate   divided attention soon after their reaching  bottom   set catherine perceived herself   earnestly regarded   gentleman who stood among  lookerson immediately behind her partner he   very handsome man   commanding aspect past  bloom but not past  vigour  life   his eye still directed towards her she saw him presently address mr tilney   familiar whisper confused  his notice  blushing   fear   being excited  something wrong  her appearance she turned away her head but while she did so  gentleman retreated  her partner coming nearer said “i see  you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name  you have  right  know his it  general tilney my father” catherine’s answer  only “oh”—but    “oh” expressing everything needful attention  his words  perfect reliance  their truth with real interest  strong admiration did her eye now follow  general   moved through  crowd  “how handsome  family they are”  her secret remark in chatting  miss tilney before  evening concluded  new source  felicity arose  her she had never taken  country walk since her arrival  bath miss tilney  whom all  commonly frequented environs  familiar spoke  them  terms which made her all eagerness  know them too   her openly fearing  she might find nobody  go  her   proposed   brother  sister  they should join   walk some morning or other “i shall like it” she cried “beyond anything   world  do not let us put  off—let us go tomorrow” this  readily agreed to  only  proviso  miss tilney’s   did not rain which catherine  sure  would not at twelve o’clock they   call  her  pulteney street  “remember—twelve o’clock”  her parting speech  her new friend of her other her older her more established friend isabella  whose fidelity  worth she had enjoyed  fortnight’s experience she scarcely saw anything during  evening yet though longing  make her acquainted  her happiness she cheerfully submitted   wish  mr allen which took them rather early away  her spirits danced within her  she danced  her chair all  way home chapter  the morrow brought  very soberlooking morning  sun making only  few efforts  appear  catherine augured   everything most favourable  her wishes a bright morning so early   year she allowed would generally turn  rain but  cloudy one foretold improvement   day advanced she applied  mr allen  confirmation  her hopes but mr allen not having his own skies  barometer about him declined giving any absolute promise  sunshine she applied  mrs allen  mrs allen’s opinion  more positive “she had no doubt   world   being  very fine day if  clouds would only go off   sun keep out” at about eleven o’clock however  few specks  small rain upon  windows caught catherine’s watchful eye  “oh dear i do believe    wet” broke  her   most desponding tone “i thought how  would be” said mrs allen “no walk  me today” sighed catherine “but perhaps  may come  nothing or  may hold up before twelve” “perhaps  may but then my dear    so dirty” “oh that  not signify i never mind dirt” “no” replied her friend very placidly “i know you never mind dirt” after  short pause “it comes  faster  faster” said catherine  she stood watching   window “so  does indeed if  keeps raining  streets   very wet” “there  four umbrellas up already how i hate  sight   umbrella” “they  disagreeable things  carry i would much rather take  chair  any time” “it  such  nicelooking morning i felt so convinced  would  dry” “anybody would have thought so indeed there   very few people   pumproom if  rains all  morning i hope mr allen  put  his greatcoat when  goes but i dare say   not   had rather do anything   world than walk out   greatcoat i wonder  should dislike it  must  so comfortable” the rain continued—fast though not heavy catherine went every five minutes   clock threatening  each return that if  still kept  raining another five minutes she would give up  matter  hopeless the clock struck twelve   still rained “you  not  able  go my dear” “i do not quite despair yet i shall not give  up till  quarter after twelve this  just  time  day    clear up  i do think  looks  little lighter there   twenty minutes after twelve  now i shall give  up entirely oh that we had such weather here  they had  udolpho or  least  tuscany   south  france—the night  poor st aubin died—such beautiful weather” at half past twelve when catherine’s anxious attention   weather  over  she could no longer claim any merit   amendment  sky began voluntarily  clear a gleam  sunshine took her quite  surprise she looked round  clouds  parting  she instantly returned   window  watch over  encourage  happy appearance ten minutes more made  certain   bright afternoon would succeed  justified  opinion  mrs allen who had “always thought  would clear up” but whether catherine might still expect her friends whether there had not been too much rain  miss tilney  venture must yet   question it  too dirty  mrs allen  accompany her husband   pumproom  accordingly set off  himself  catherine had barely watched him down  street when her notice  claimed   approach   same two open carriages containing  same three people  had surprised her so much  few mornings back “isabella my brother  mr thorpe i declare they  coming  me perhaps—but i shall not go—i cannot go indeed  you know miss tilney may still call” mrs allen agreed  it john thorpe  soon  them  his voice   them yet sooner    stairs   calling out  miss morland   quick “make haste make haste”   threw open  door “put  your hat this moment—there  no time   lost—we  going  bristol how d’ye do mrs allen” “to bristol is not   great way off but however i cannot go  you today because i am engaged i expect some friends every moment” this   course vehemently talked down  no reason  all mrs allen  called   second him   two others walked in  give their assistance “my sweetest catherine  not this delightful we shall have  most heavenly drive you   thank your brother  me   scheme  darted into our heads  breakfasttime i verily believe   same instant  we should have been off two hours ago if  had not been  this detestable rain but  does not signify  nights  moonlight  we shall do delightfully oh i am  such ecstasies   thoughts   little country air  quiet so much better than going   lower rooms we shall drive directly  clifton  dine there and  soon  dinner  over if there  time  it go   kingsweston” “i doubt our being able  do so much” said morland “you croaking fellow” cried thorpe “we shall  able  do ten times more kingsweston aye  blaize castle too  anything else we can hear of but here  your sister says she  not go” “blaize castle” cried catherine “what  that” “the finest place  england—worth going fifty miles  any time  see” “what   really  castle  old castle” “the oldest   kingdom” “but   like what one reads of” “exactly—the very same” “but now really—are there towers  long galleries” “by dozens” “then i should like  see it but i cannot—i cannot go” “not go my beloved creature what do you mean” “i cannot go because”—looking down  she spoke fearful  isabella’s smile—“i expect miss tilney  her brother  call  me  take  country walk they promised  come  twelve only  rained but now    so fine i dare say they   here soon” “not they indeed” cried thorpe “for  we turned into broad street i saw them—does  not drive  phaeton  bright chestnuts” “i do not know indeed” “yes i know  does i saw him you  talking   man you danced  last night  not you” “yes” “well i saw him   moment turn up  lansdown road driving  smartlooking girl” “did you indeed” “did upon my soul knew him again directly   seemed  have got some very pretty cattle too” “it  very odd but i suppose they thought  would  too dirty   walk” “and well they might  i never saw so much dirt  my life walk you could no more walk than you could fly it  not been so dirty  whole winter   ankledeep everywhere” isabella corroborated it “my dearest catherine you cannot form  idea   dirt come you must go you cannot refuse going now” “i should like  see  castle but may we go all over it may we go up every staircase  into every suite  rooms” “yes yes every hole  corner” “but then if they should only  gone out   hour till   dryer  call   by” “make yourself easy there  no danger  that  i heard tilney hallooing   man who  just passing   horseback  they  going  far  wick rocks” “then i will shall i go mrs allen” “just  you please my dear” “mrs allen you must persuade her  go”   general cry mrs allen  not inattentive  it “well my dear” said she “suppose you go” and  two minutes they  off catherine’s feelings  she got into  carriage    very unsettled state divided between regret   loss  one great pleasure   hope  soon enjoying another almost  equal  degree however unlike  kind she could not think  tilneys had acted quite well  her  so readily giving up their engagement without sending her any message  excuse it  now but  hour later than  time fixed    beginning  their walk and  spite  what she had heard   prodigious accumulation  dirt   course   hour she could not  her own observation help thinking  they might have gone  very little inconvenience to feel herself slighted  them  very painful on  other hand  delight  exploring  edifice like udolpho  her fancy represented blaize castle  be  such  counterpoise  good  might console her  almost anything they passed briskly down pulteney street  through laura place without  exchange  many words thorpe talked  his horse  she meditated  turns  broken promises  broken arches phaetons  false hangings tilneys  trapdoors as they entered argyle buildings however she  roused  this address  her companion “who   girl who looked  you so hard  she went by” “who where” “on  righthand pavement—she must  almost out  sight now” catherine looked round  saw miss tilney leaning  her brother’s arm walking slowly down  street she saw them both looking back  her “stop stop mr thorpe” she impatiently cried “it  miss tilney   indeed how could you tell me they  gone stop stop i  get out this moment  go  them” but  what purpose did she speak thorpe only lashed his horse into  brisker trot  tilneys who had soon ceased  look after her    moment out  sight round  corner  laura place   another moment she  herself whisked into  marketplace still however  during  length  another street she entreated him  stop “pray pray stop mr thorpe i cannot go on i  not go on i must go back  miss tilney” but mr thorpe only laughed smacked his whip encouraged his horse made odd noises  drove on  catherine angry  vexed  she was having no power  getting away  obliged  give up  point  submit her reproaches however  not spared “how could you deceive me so mr thorpe how could you say  you saw them driving up  lansdown road i would not have had  happen so   world they must think  so strange so rude  me to go  them too without saying  word you do not know how vexed i am i shall have no pleasure  clifton nor  anything else i had rather ten thousand times rather get out now  walk back  them how could you say you saw them driving out   phaeton” thorpe defended himself very stoutly declared  had never seen two men so much alike  his life  would hardly give up  point   having been tilney himself their drive even when this subject  over  not likely   very agreeable catherine’s complaisance  no longer what  had been  their former airing she listened reluctantly  her replies  short blaize castle remained her only comfort towards that she still looked  intervals  pleasure though rather than  disappointed   promised walk  especially rather than  thought ill    tilneys she would willingly have given up all  happiness which  walls could supply—the happiness   progress through  long suite  lofty rooms exhibiting  remains  magnificent furniture though now  many years deserted—the happiness  being stopped  their way along narrow winding vaults   low grated door or even  having their lamp their only lamp extinguished   sudden gust  wind   being left  total darkness in  meanwhile they proceeded  their journey without any mischance   within view   town  keynsham when  halloo  morland who  behind them made his friend pull up  know what   matter the others then came close enough  conversation  morland said “we had better go back thorpe   too late  go  today your sister thinks so  well  i we have been exactly  hour coming  pulteney street very little more than seven miles and i suppose we have  least eight more  go it  never do we set out  great deal too late we had much better put  off till another day  turn round” “it  all one  me” replied thorpe rather angrily  instantly turning his horse they   their way back  bath “if your brother had not got such  d—beast  drive” said  soon afterwards “we might have done  very well my horse would have trotted  clifton within  hour if left  himself  i have almost broke my arm  pulling him    cursed brokenwinded jade’s pace morland   fool  not keeping  horse  gig  his own” “no   not” said catherine warmly “for i am sure  could not afford it” “and why cannot  afford it” “because   not money enough” “and whose fault  that” “nobody’s  i know of” thorpe then said something   loud incoherent way  which  had often recourse about  being  d—thing   miserly   if people who rolled  money could not afford things  did not know who could which catherine did not even endeavour  understand disappointed  what   have been  consolation  her first disappointment she  less  less disposed either   agreeable herself or  find her companion so  they returned  pulteney street without her speaking twenty words as she entered  house  footman told her   gentleman  lady had called  inquired  her  few minutes after her setting off that when  told them she  gone out  mr thorpe  lady had asked whether any message had been left  her   his saying no had felt   card but said she had none about her  went away pondering over these heartrending tidings catherine walked slowly upstairs at  head  them she  met  mr allen who  hearing  reason  their speedy return said “i am glad your brother had so much sense i am glad you  come back it   strange wild scheme” they all spent  evening together  thorpe’s catherine  disturbed  out  spirits but isabella seemed  find  pool  commerce   fate  which she shared  private partnership  morland  very good equivalent   quiet  country air   inn  clifton her satisfaction too  not being   lower rooms  spoken more than once “how i pity  poor creatures   going there how glad i am  i am not amongst them i wonder whether     full ball or not they have not begun dancing yet i would not  there  all  world it  so delightful  have  evening now  then  oneself i dare say   not   very good ball i know  mitchells  not  there i am sure i pity everybody  is but i dare say mr morland you long    it do not you i am sure you do well pray do not let anybody here   restraint  you i dare say we could do very well without you but you men think yourselves  such consequence” catherine could almost have accused isabella  being wanting  tenderness towards herself  her sorrows so very little did they appear  dwell  her mind  so very inadequate   comfort she offered “do not  so dull my dearest creature” she whispered “you  quite break my heart it  amazingly shocking   sure but  tilneys  entirely  blame why  not they more punctual it  dirty indeed but what did  signify i am sure john  i should not have minded it i never mind going through anything where  friend  concerned   my disposition  john  just  same   amazing strong feelings good heavens what  delightful hand you have got kings i vow i never  so happy  my life i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself” and now i may dismiss my heroine   sleepless couch which   true heroine’s portion   pillow strewed  thorns  wet  tears and lucky may she think herself if she get another good night’s rest   course   next three months chapter  “mrs allen” said catherine  next morning “will there  any harm  my calling  miss tilney today i shall not  easy till i have explained everything” “go  all means my dear only put   white gown miss tilney always wears white” catherine cheerfully complied  being properly equipped  more impatient than ever     pumproom  she might inform herself  general tilney’s lodgings  though she believed they   milsom street she  not certain   house  mrs allen’s wavering convictions only made  more doubtful to milsom street she  directed  having made herself perfect   number hastened away  eager steps   beating heart  pay her visit explain her conduct   forgiven tripping lightly through  churchyard  resolutely turning away her eyes  she might not  obliged  see her beloved isabella  her dear family who she had reason  believe    shop hard by she reached  house without any impediment looked   number knocked   door  inquired  miss tilney the man believed miss tilney    home but  not quite certain would she  pleased  send up her name she gave her card in  few minutes  servant returned    look which did not quite confirm his words said  had been mistaken   miss tilney  walked out catherine   blush  mortification left  house she felt almost persuaded  miss tilney was  home  too much offended  admit her   she retired down  street could not withhold one glance   drawingroom windows  expectation  seeing her there but no one appeared  them at  bottom   street however she looked back again  then not   window but issuing   door she saw miss tilney herself she  followed   gentleman whom catherine believed   her father  they turned up towards edgar’s buildings catherine  deep mortification proceeded  her way she could almost  angry herself  such angry incivility but she checked  resentful sensation she remembered her own ignorance she knew not how such  offence  hers might  classed   laws  worldly politeness  what  degree  unforgivingness  might  propriety lead nor  what rigours  rudeness  return  might justly make her amenable dejected  humbled she had even some thoughts  not going   others   theatre  night but  must  confessed  they  not  long continuance  she soon recollected   first place  she  without any excuse  staying  home and   second     play she wanted very much  see to  theatre accordingly they all went no tilneys appeared  plague or please her she feared that amongst  many perfections   family  fondness  plays  not   ranked but perhaps   because they  habituated   finer performances   london stage which she knew  isabella’s authority rendered everything else   kind “quite horrid” she  not deceived  her own expectation  pleasure  comedy so well suspended her care  no one observing her during  first four acts would have supposed she had any wretchedness about her on  beginning   fifth however  sudden view  mr henry tilney  his father joining  party   opposite box recalled her  anxiety  distress the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment—no longer keep her whole attention every other look upon  average  directed towards  opposite box and   space  two entire scenes did she thus watch henry tilney without being once able  catch his eye no longer could   suspected  indifference   play his notice  never withdrawn   stage during two whole scenes at length however  did look towards her   bowed—but such  bow no smile no continued observance attended it his eyes  immediately returned  their former direction catherine  restlessly miserable she could almost have run round   box  which  sat  forced him  hear her explanation feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her instead  considering her own dignity injured  this ready condemnation—instead  proudly resolving  conscious innocence  show her resentment towards him who could harbour  doubt  it  leave  him all  trouble  seeking  explanation   enlighten him   past only  avoiding his sight or flirting  somebody else—she took  herself all  shame  misconduct or  least   appearance   only eager   opportunity  explaining  cause the play concluded—the curtain fell—henry tilney  no longer   seen where  had hitherto sat but his father remained  perhaps  might  now coming round  their box she  right   few minutes  appeared and making his way through  then thinning rows spoke  like calm politeness  mrs allen  her friend not  such calmness   answered   latter “oh mr tilney i have been quite wild  speak  you  make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed   not my own fault  it mrs allen did not they tell me  mr tilney  his sister  gone out   phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been  you now had not i mrs allen” “my dear you tumble my gown”  mrs allen’s reply her assurance however standing sole   did  not thrown away  brought  more cordial more natural smile into his countenance   replied   tone which retained only  little affected reserve “we  much obliged  you  any rate  wishing us  pleasant walk after our passing you  argyle street you  so kind   look back  purpose” “but indeed i did not wish you  pleasant walk i never thought  such  thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly  stop i called out  him  soon  ever i saw you now mrs allen did not—oh you  not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out  run after you” is there  henry   world who could  insensible  such  declaration henry tilney  least  not with  yet sweeter smile  said everything  need  said  his sister’s concern regret  dependence  catherine’s honour “oh do not say miss tilney  not angry” cried catherine “because i know she was  she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out   house  next minute after my leaving it i  hurt but i  not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there” “i  not within   time but i heard    eleanor  she  been wishing ever since  see you  explain  reason  such incivility but perhaps i can do   well it  nothing more than  my father—they  just preparing  walk out   being hurried  time  not caring  have  put off—made  point  her being denied that  all i do assure you she  very much vexed  meant  make her apology  soon  possible” catherine’s mind  greatly eased  this information yet  something  solicitude remained  which sprang  following question thoroughly artless  itself though rather distressing   gentleman “but mr tilney why  you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence  my good intentions  could suppose    only  mistake why should you  so ready  take offence” “me i take offence” “nay i am sure  your look when you came into  box you  angry” “i angry i could have no right” “well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face” he replied  asking her  make room  him  talking   play he remained  them some time   only too agreeable  catherine   contented when  went away before they parted however   agreed   projected walk should  taken  soon  possible and setting aside  misery  his quitting their box she was upon  whole left one   happiest creatures   world while talking  each other she had observed  some surprise  john thorpe who  never   same part   house  ten minutes together  engaged  conversation  general tilney  she felt something more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herself  object  their attention  discourse what could they have  say  her she feared general tilney did not like her appearance she found   implied  his preventing her admittance  his daughter rather than postpone his own walk  few minutes “how came mr thorpe  know your father”  her anxious inquiry  she pointed them out  her companion he knew nothing about it but his father like every military man had  very large acquaintance when  entertainment  over thorpe came  assist them  getting out catherine   immediate object  his gallantry and while they waited   lobby   chair  prevented  inquiry which had travelled  her heart almost   tip  her tongue  asking   consequential manner whether she had seen him talking  general tilney “he   fine old fellow upon my soul stout active—looks  young  his son i have  great regard  him i assure you  gentlemanlike good sort  fellow  ever lived” “but how came you  know him” “know him there  few people much about town  i do not know i have met him forever   bedford  i knew his face again today  moment  came into  billiardroom one   best players we have   by  we had  little touch together though i  almost afraid  him  first  odds  five  four against me and if i had not made one   cleanest strokes  perhaps ever  made  this world—i took his ball exactly—but i could not make you understand  without  table however i did beat him a very fine fellow  rich   jew i should like  dine  him i dare say  gives famous dinners but what do you think we have been talking of you yes  heavens and  general thinks you  finest girl  bath” “oh nonsense how can you say so” “and what do you think i said”—lowering his voice—“well done general said i i am quite  your mind” here catherine who  much less gratified  his admiration than  general tilney’s  not sorry   called away  mr allen thorpe however would see her  her chair and till she entered it continued  same kind  delicate flattery  spite  her entreating him  have done that general tilney instead  disliking should admire her  very delightful  she joyfully thought  there  not one   family whom she need now fear  meet the evening had done more much more  her than could have been expected chapter  monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday  saturday have now passed  review before  reader  events  each day  hopes  fears mortifications  pleasures have been separately stated   pangs  sunday only now remain   described  close  week the clifton scheme had been deferred not relinquished    afternoon’s crescent  this day   brought forward again in  private consultation between isabella  james  former  whom had particularly set her heart upon going   latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her   agreed that provided  weather  fair  party should take place   following morning  they   set off very early  order    home  good time the affair thus determined  thorpe’s approbation secured catherine only remained   apprised  it she had left them   few minutes  speak  miss tilney in  interval  plan  completed   soon  she came again her agreement  demanded but instead   gay acquiescence expected  isabella catherine looked grave  very sorry but could not go the engagement which ought  have kept her  joining   former attempt would make  impossible  her  accompany them now she had  moment settled  miss tilney  take their proposed walk tomorrow   quite determined  she would not upon any account retract but  she must  should retract  instantly  eager cry  both  thorpes they must go  clifton tomorrow they would not go without her  would  nothing  put off  mere walk  one day longer  they would not hear   refusal catherine  distressed but not subdued “do not urge me isabella i am engaged  miss tilney i cannot go” this availed nothing the same arguments assailed her again she must go she should go  they would not hear   refusal “it would  so easy  tell miss tilney  you had just been reminded   prior engagement  must only beg  put off  walk till tuesday” “no  would not  easy i could not do it there  been no prior engagement” but isabella became only more  more urgent calling  her   most affectionate manner addressing her   most endearing names she  sure her dearest sweetest catherine would not seriously refuse such  trifling request   friend who loved her so dearly she knew her beloved catherine  have so feeling  heart so sweet  temper   so easily persuaded  those she loved but all  vain catherine felt herself     right  though pained  such tender such flattering supplication could not allow   influence her isabella then tried another method she reproached her  having more affection  miss tilney though she had known her so little  while than  her best  oldest friends  being grown cold  indifferent  short towards herself “i cannot help being jealous catherine when i see myself slighted  strangers i who love you so excessively when once my affections  placed   not   power  anything  change them but i believe my feelings  stronger than anybody’s i am sure they  too strong  my own peace   see myself supplanted  your friendship  strangers does cut me   quick i own these tilneys seem  swallow up everything else” catherine thought this reproach equally strange  unkind was   part

nothing isabella   meanwhile had applied her handkerchief  her eyes  morland miserable  such  sight could not help saying “nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice  not much   oblige such  friend—i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse” this   first time  her brother’s openly siding against her  anxious  avoid his displeasure she proposed  compromise if they would only put off their scheme till tuesday which they might easily do   depended only  themselves she could go  them  everybody might then  satisfied but “no no no”   immediate answer “that could not be  thorpe did not know   might not go  town  tuesday” catherine  sorry but could do no more   short silence ensued which  broken  isabella who   voice  cold resentment said “very well then there   end   party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot   only woman i would not upon any account   world do so improper  thing” “catherine you must go” said james “but why cannot mr thorpe drive one  his other sisters i dare say either  them would like  go” “thank ye” cried thorpe “but i did not come  bath  drive my sisters about  look like  fool no if you do not go d—— me if i do i only go   sake  driving you” “that   compliment which gives me no pleasure” but her words  lost  thorpe who had turned abruptly away the three others still continued together walking   most uncomfortable manner  poor catherine sometimes not  word  said sometimes she  again attacked  supplications or reproaches  her arm  still linked within isabella’s though their hearts   war at one moment she  softened  another irritated always distressed but always steady “i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine” said james “you  not used   so hard  persuade you once   kindest besttempered  my sisters” “i hope i am not less so now” she replied very feelingly “but indeed i cannot go if i am wrong i am doing what i believe   right” “i suspect” said isabella   low voice “there  no great struggle” catherine’s heart swelled she drew away her arm  isabella made no opposition thus passed  long ten minutes till they  again joined  thorpe who coming  them   gayer look said “well i have settled  matter  now we may all go tomorrow   safe conscience i have been  miss tilney  made your excuses” “you have not” cried catherine “i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me  say that having just recollected  prior engagement  going  clifton  us tomorrow you could not have  pleasure  walking  her till tuesday she said very well tuesday  just  convenient  her so there   end  all our difficulties a pretty good thought  mine—hey” isabella’s countenance  once more all smiles  good humour  james too looked happy again “a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses  over you  honourably acquitted  we shall have  most delightful party” “this  not do” said catherine “i cannot submit  this i must run after miss tilney directly  set her right” isabella however caught hold  one hand thorpe   other  remonstrances poured   all three even james  quite angry when everything  settled when miss tilney herself said  tuesday would suit her  well   quite ridiculous quite absurd  make any further objection “i do not care mr thorpe had no business  invent any such message if i had thought  right  put  off i could have spoken  miss tilney myself this  only doing    ruder way  how do i know  mr thorpe has—he may  mistaken again perhaps  led me into one act  rudeness  his mistake  friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me” thorpe told her  would   vain  go after  tilneys they  turning  corner into brock street when  had overtaken them    home  this time “then i  go after them” said catherine “wherever they  i  go after them it does not signify talking if i could not  persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never   tricked into it” and  these words she broke away  hurried off thorpe would have darted after her but morland withheld him “let her go let her go if she  go” “she   obstinate as—” thorpe never finished  simile   could hardly have been  proper one away walked catherine  great agitation  fast

i could not go—i ran away   great hurry  explain it—i did not care what you thought  me—i would not stay   servant” the business however though not perfectly elucidated  this speech soon ceased    puzzle catherine found  john thorpe had given  message  miss tilney had no scruple  owning herself greatly surprised  it but whether her brother had still exceeded her  resentment catherine though she instinctively addressed herself  much  one    other  her vindication had no means  knowing whatever might have been felt before her arrival her eager declarations immediately made every look  sentence

her if she would do his daughter  honour  dining  spending  rest   day  her miss tilney added her own wishes catherine  greatly obliged but   quite out  her power mr  mrs allen would expect her back every moment the general declared  could say no more  claims  mr  mrs allen  not   superseded but  some other day  trusted when longer notice could  given they would not refuse  spare her  her friend “oh no catherine  sure they would not have  least objection  she should have great pleasure  coming” the general attended her himself   streetdoor saying everything gallant  they went downstairs

“and do you think  going too” “no i had just engaged myself  walk  miss tilney before they told me  it  therefore you know i could not go  them could i” “no certainly not  i am glad you do not think  it these schemes  not  all  thing young men  women driving about  country  open carriages now  then   very well but going  inns  public places together it  not right  i wonder mrs thorpe should allow it i am glad you do not think  going i am sure mrs morland would not  pleased mrs allen  not you  my way  thinking do not you think these kind  projects objectionable” “yes very much so indeed open carriages  nasty things a clean gown  not five minutes’ wear  them you  splashed getting   getting out   wind takes your hair  your bonnet  every direction i hate  open carriage myself” “i know you do but   not  question do not you think    odd appearance if young ladies  frequently driven about  them  young men  whom they  not even related” “yes my dear  very odd appearance indeed i cannot bear  see it” “dear madam” cried catherine “then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known    improper i would not have gone  mr thorpe  all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i  doing wrong” “and so i should my dear you may depend  it   i told mrs morland  parting i would always do  best  you  my power but one must not  over particular young people will  young

“that  just what i  going  say” added his wife catherine relieved  herself felt uneasy  isabella  after  moment’s thought asked mr allen whether  would not  both proper  kind  her  write  miss thorpe

such thing “you had better leave her alone my dear she  old enough  know what she  about  if not   mother  advise her mrs thorpe  too indulgent beyond  doubt but however you had better not interfere she  your brother choose  go  you   only getting ill will” catherine submitted  though sorry  think  isabella should  doing wrong felt greatly relieved  mr allen’s approbation  her own conduct  truly

catherine again discerned  force  love “indeed isabella you  too humble the difference  fortune can  nothing  signify” “oh my sweet catherine  your generous heart i know  would signify nothing but we

enjoyment  his company the former she hoped  last might have been accidental   latter she could only attribute  her own stupidity isabella  hearing  particulars   visit gave  different explanation “it  all pride pride insufferable haughtiness  pride she had long suspected  family   very high  this made  certain such insolence  behaviour  miss tilney’s she had never heard   her life not  do  honours

isabella’s opinion   tilneys did not influence her friend she  sure there had been no insolence   manners either  brother or sister  she did not credit there being any pride  their hearts the evening rewarded her confidence she  met  one   same kindness    other   same attention  heretofore miss tilney took pains   near her  henry asked her  dance having heard  day before  milsom street  their

looked  him  great admiration  even supposed  possible  some people might think him handsomer than his brother though  her eyes his air  more assuming  his countenance less prepossessing his taste  manners  beyond  doubt decidedly inferior for within her hearing  not only protested against every thought  dancing himself but even laughed openly  henry  finding  possible from  latter circumstance

herself at  end   first dance captain tilney came towards them again and much  catherine’s dissatisfaction pulled his brother away they retired whispering together and though her delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm  lay  down  fact  captain tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation  her which  now hastened  communicate  his brother   hope  separating them forever she could not have her partner conveyed  her sight without very uneasy sensations her suspense   full five minutes’ duration  she  beginning  think   very long quarter   hour when they both returned   explanation  given  henry’s requesting  know if she thought her friend miss thorpe would have any objection  dancing  his brother would  most happy   introduced  her catherine without hesitation replied  she  very sure miss thorpe did not mean  dance  all the cruel reply  passed    other   immediately walked away “your brother  not mind it i know” said she “because i heard him say before   hated dancing but   very goodnatured  him  think  it i suppose  saw isabella sitting down  fancied she might wish   partner but   quite mistaken  she would not dance upon any account   world” henry smiled  said “how very little trouble  can give you  understand  motive  other people’s actions” “why what do you mean” “with you   not how  such  one likely   influenced what   inducement most likely

only meant  your attributing my brother’s wish  dancing  miss thorpe  good nature alone convinced me  your being superior  good nature yourself  all  rest   world” catherine blushed  disclaimed   gentleman’s predictions  verified there   something however  his words which repaid her   pain  confusion   something occupied her mind so much  she drew back  some time forgetting  speak or  listen  almost forgetting where she was till roused   voice  isabella she looked up  saw her  captain tilney preparing  give them hands across isabella shrugged her shoulders  smiled  only explanation  this extraordinary change which could   time  given but    not quite enough  catherine’s comprehension she spoke her astonishment  very plain terms  her partner “i cannot think how  could happen isabella  so determined not  dance” “and did isabella never change her mind before” “oh but because—and your brother after what you told him  me how could  think  going  ask her” “i cannot take surprise  myself   head you bid me  surprised  your friend’s account  therefore i am but   my brother his conduct   business i must own  been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness  your friend   open attraction her firmness you know could only  understood  yourself” “you  laughing but i assure you isabella  very firm  general” “it   much  should  said  anyone to  always firm must    often obstinate when properly  relax   trial  judgment and without reference  my brother i really think miss thorpe   no means chosen ill  fixing   present hour” the friends  not able  get together  any confidential discourse till all  dancing  over but then  they walked about  room arm  arm isabella thus explained herself “i do not wonder  your surprise  i am really fatigued  death he  such  rattle amusing enough if my mind had been disengaged but i would have given  world  sit still” “then why did not you” “oh my dear it would have looked so particular  you know how i abhor doing that i refused him  long  i possibly could but  would take no denial you have no idea how  pressed me i begged him  excuse me  get some other partner—but no not he after aspiring  my hand there  nobody else   room  could bear  think of    not   wanted merely  dance  wanted    me oh such nonsense i told him  had taken  very unlikely way  prevail upon me for  all things   world i hated fine speeches  compliments  so—and so then i found there would  no peace if i did not stand up besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take  ill if i did not  your dear brother i am sure  would have been miserable if i had sat down  whole evening i am so glad   over my spirits  quite jaded  listening  his nonsense  then being such  smart young fellow i saw every eye  upon us” “he  very handsome indeed” “handsome yes i suppose  may i dare say people would admire him  general but   not  all  my style  beauty i hate  florid complexion  dark eyes   man however   very well amazingly conceited i am sure i took him down several times you know  my way” when  young ladies next met they had  far more interesting subject  discuss james morland’s second letter  then received   kind intentions  his father fully explained a living  which mr morland  himself patron  incumbent  about four hundred pounds yearly value    resigned  his son  soon   should  old enough  take it no trifling deduction   family income no niggardly assignment  one  ten children an estate   least equal value moreover  assured  his future inheritance james expressed himself   occasion  becoming gratitude   necessity  waiting between two  three years before they could marry being however unwelcome no more than  had expected  borne  him without discontent catherine whose expectations had been  unfixed  her ideas  her father’s income  whose judgment  now entirely led  her brother felt equally well satisfied  heartily congratulated isabella  having everything so pleasantly settled “it  very charming indeed” said isabella   grave face “mr morland  behaved vastly handsome indeed” said  gentle mrs thorpe looking anxiously  her daughter “i only wish i could do  much one could not expect more  him you know if  finds  can do more   by i dare say  will  i am sure  must   excellent goodhearted man four hundred  but  small income  begin  indeed but your wishes my dear isabella  so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear” “it  not  my own account i wish  more but i cannot bear    means  injuring my dear morland making him sit down upon  income hardly enough  find one   common necessaries  life for myself   nothing i never think  myself” “i know you never do my dear  you  always find your reward   affection  makes everybody feel  you there never   young woman so beloved  you   everybody  knows you  i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child—but do not let us distress our dear catherine  talking  such things mr morland  behaved so very handsome you know i always heard    most excellent man  you know my dear we  not  suppose but what if you had had  suitable fortune  would have come down  something more  i am sure  must   most liberalminded man” “nobody can think better  mr morland than i do i am sure but everybody  their failing you know  everybody   right  do what they like  their own money” catherine  hurt  these insinuations “i am very sure” said she “that my father  promised  do  much   can afford” isabella recollected herself “as  that my sweet catherine there cannot   doubt  you know me well enough   sure   much smaller income would satisfy me it  not  want  more money  makes me just  present  little out  spirits i hate money  if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds  year i should not have  wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there’s  sting the long long endless two years  half    pass before your brother can hold  living” “yes yes my darling isabella” said mrs thorpe “we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand  present vexation  everybody must love you  better  such  noble honest affection” catherine’s uncomfortable feelings began  lessen she endeavoured  believe

dearest catherine” continued  other without  all listening  her “i would not  all  world   means  hurrying you into  engagement before you knew what you  about i do not think anything would justify me  wishing you  sacrifice all your happiness merely  oblige my brother because   my brother  who perhaps after all you know might  just  happy without you  people seldom know what they would  at young

i believe   very right ah here  comes never mind   not see us i am sure” catherine looking up perceived captain tilney  isabella earnestly fixing her eye  him  she spoke soon caught his notice he approached immediately  took  seat  which her movements invited him his first address made catherine start though spoken low she could distinguish “what always   watched  person or  proxy” “psha nonsense”  isabella’s answer   same half whisper “why do you put such things into my head if i could believe it—my spirit you know  pretty independent” “i wish your heart  independent that would  enough  me” “my heart indeed what can you have  do  hearts you men have none  you any hearts” “if we have not hearts we have eyes  they give us torment enough” “do they i am sorry  it i am sorry they find anything so disagreeable  me i  look another way i hope this pleases you” turning her back  him “i hope your eyes  not tormented now” “never more so   edge   blooming cheek  still  view—at once too much  too little” catherine heard all this  quite out  countenance could listen no longer amazed  isabella could endure it  jealous  her brother she rose up  saying she should join mrs allen proposed their walking but  this isabella showed no inclination she  so amazingly tired    so odious  parade about  pumproom  if she moved  her seat she should miss her sisters she  expecting her sisters every moment so  her dearest catherine must excuse her  must sit quietly down again but catherine could  stubborn too  mrs allen just then coming up  propose their returning home she joined her  walked out   pumproom leaving isabella still sitting  captain tilney with much uneasiness did she thus leave them it seemed  her  captain tilney  falling  love  isabella  isabella unconsciously encouraging him unconsciously  must be  isabella’s attachment  james   certain  well acknowledged  her engagement to doubt her truth or good intentions  impossible  yet during  whole  their conversation her manner had been odd she wished isabella had talked more like her usual self  not so much about money  had not looked so well pleased   sight  captain tilney how strange  she should not perceive his admiration catherine longed  give her  hint  it  put her  her guard  prevent all  pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both  him  her brother the compliment  john thorpe’s affection did not make amends  this thoughtlessness  his sister she  almost  far  believing   wishing    sincere  she had not forgotten   could mistake  his assertion   offer   her encouragement convinced her  his mistakes could sometimes  very egregious in vanity therefore she gained but little her chief profit   wonder that  should think  worth his while  fancy himself  love  her   matter  lively astonishment isabella talked  his attentions she had never been sensible  any but isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken  haste  would never  said again  upon this she  glad  rest altogether  present ease  comfort chapter  a few days passed away  catherine though not allowing herself  suspect her friend could not help watching her closely the result  her observations  not agreeable isabella seemed  altered creature when she saw her indeed surrounded only  their immediate friends  edgar’s buildings or pulteney street her change  manners  so trifling that had  gone no farther  might have passed unnoticed a something  languid indifference or   boasted absence  mind which catherine had never heard  before would occasionally come across her but had nothing worse appeared that might only have spread  new grace  inspired  warmer interest but when catherine saw her  public admitting captain tilney’s attentions  readily  they  offered  allowing him almost  equal share  james  her notice  smiles  alteration became too positive   passed over what could  meant  such unsteady conduct what her friend could  at  beyond her comprehension isabella could not  aware   pain she  inflicting but    degree  wilful thoughtlessness which catherine could not but resent james   sufferer she saw him grave  uneasy  however careless  his present

not upon reflection imagine him aware  it he might  jealous  her brother   rival but if more had seemed implied  fault must have been  her misapprehension she wished   gentle remonstrance  remind isabella  her situation  make her aware  this double unkindness but  remonstrance either opportunity or comprehension  always against her if able  suggest  hint isabella could never understand it in this distress  intended departure   tilney family became her chief consolation their journey into gloucestershire   take place within  few days  captain tilney’s removal would  least restore peace  every heart but his own but captain tilney had  present no intention  removing   not     party  northanger    continue  bath when catherine knew this her resolution  directly made she spoke  henry tilney   subject regretting his brother’s evident partiality  miss thorpe  entreating him  make known her prior engagement “my brother does know it”  henry’s answer “does he then why does  stay here” he made no reply   beginning  talk  something else but she eagerly continued “why do not you persuade him  go away the longer  stays  worse     him  last pray advise him  his own sake   everybody’s sake  leave bath directly absence   time make him comfortable again but  can have no hope here    only staying   miserable” henry smiled  said “i am sure my brother would not wish  do that” “then you  persuade him  go away” “persuasion  not  command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour  persuade him i have myself told him  miss thorpe  engaged he knows what   about  must  his own master” “no  does not know what   about” cried catherine “he does not know  pain   giving my brother not  james  ever told me so but i am sure   very uncomfortable” “and  you sure   my brother’s doing” “yes very sure” “is  my brother’s attentions  miss thorpe or miss thorpe’s admission  them  gives  pain” “is not   same thing” “i think mr morland would acknowledge  difference no man  offended  another man’s admiration   woman  loves    woman only who can make   torment” catherine blushed  her friend  said “isabella  wrong but i am sure she cannot mean  torment  she  very much attached  my brother she  been  love  him ever since they first met  while my father’s consent  uncertain she fretted herself almost into  fever you know she must  attached  him” “i understand she   love  james  flirts  frederick” “oh no not flirts a woman  love  one man cannot flirt  another” “it  probable  she  neither love so well nor flirt so well  she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up  little” after  short pause catherine resumed with “then you do not believe isabella so very much attached  my brother” “i can have no opinion   subject” “but what can your brother mean if  knows her engagement what can  mean  his behaviour” “you   very close questioner” “am i i only ask what i want   told” “but do you only ask what i can  expected  tell” “yes i think so  you must know your brother’s heart” “my brother’s heart  you term it   present occasion i assure you i can only guess at” “well” “well nay if     guesswork let us all guess  ourselves to  guided  secondhand conjecture  pitiful the premises  before you my brother   lively  perhaps sometimes  thoughtless young man   had about  week’s acquaintance  your friend    known her engagement almost  long    known her” “well” said catherine after some moments’ consideration “you may  able  guess  your brother’s intentions  all this but i am sure i cannot but  not your father uncomfortable about it does not  want captain tilney  go away sure if your father   speak  him  would go” “my dear miss morland” said henry “in this amiable solicitude  your brother’s comfort may you not   little mistaken are you not carried  little too far would  thank you either  his own account or miss thorpe’s  supposing  her affection or  least her good behaviour  only   secured  her seeing nothing  captain tilney is  safe only  solitude or  her heart constant  him only when unsolicited  anyone else he cannot think this—and you may  sure   would not have you think it i  not say ‘do not  uneasy’ because i know  you  so  this moment but   little uneasy  you can you have no doubt   mutual attachment  your brother  your friend depend upon it therefore  real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon   no disagreement between them can   any duration their hearts  open  each other  neither heart can   you they know exactly what  required  what can  borne  you may  certain  one  never tease  other beyond what  known

she added desiring  get rid   subject “and storms  sleeplessness  nothing when they  over what beautiful hyacinths i have just learnt  love  hyacinth” “and how might you learn by accident or argument” “your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used  take pains year after year  make me like them but i never could till i saw them  other day  milsom street i am naturally indifferent about

not advance her composure the elegance   breakfast set forced itself  catherine’s notice when they  seated  table and luckily  had been  general’s choice he  enchanted  her approbation  his taste

another glimpse  his figure “this   somewhat heavy call upon your brother’s fortitude” observed  general  eleanor “woodston  make but  sombre appearance today” “is   pretty place” asked catherine “what say you eleanor speak your opinion  ladies can best tell  taste  ladies  regard  places  well  men i think  would  acknowledged   most impartial eye  have many recommendations the house stands

unanswerable something had been said  evening before  her being shown over  house   now offered himself  her conductor  though catherine had hoped  explore  accompanied only  his daughter    proposal

speak  her unwillingness   should  taking them out  doors against his own inclination under  mistaken idea  pleasing her but she  stopped  miss tilney’s saying   little confusion “i believe    wisest  take  morning while   so fine  do not  uneasy  my father’s account  always walks out  this time  day” catherine did not exactly know how this    understood why  miss tilney embarrassed could there  any unwillingness   general’s side  show her over  abbey the proposal  his own and  not  odd   should always take his walk so early neither her father nor mr allen did so it  certainly very provoking she  all impatience  see  house  had scarcely any curiosity about  grounds if henry had been  them indeed but now she should not know what  picturesque when she saw it such  her thoughts but she kept

assenting gratitude   seemed  if his own estimation  northanger had waited unfixed till  hour the kitchengarden    next admired   led  way   across  small portion   park the number  acres contained

endless  length  village  hothouses seemed  arise among them   whole parish    work within  enclosure the general  flattered  her looks  surprise which told him almost  plainly   soon forced her  tell him  words  she had never seen any gardens  all equal  them before   then modestly owned that “without any ambition   sort himself—without any solicitude about it—he did believe them   unrivalled

such  garden  his the utmost care could not always secure  most valuable fruits the pinery had yielded only one hundred   last year mr allen  supposed must feel these inconveniences  well  himself” “no not  all mr allen did not care about  garden  never went into it” with  triumphant smile  selfsatisfaction  general wished  could do  same   never entered his without being vexed  some way or other   falling short  his plan “how  mr allen’s successionhouses worked” describing  nature  his own  they entered them “mr allen had only one small hothouse which mrs allen had  use   her plants

not tired “but where  you going eleanor why do you choose  cold damp path  it miss morland  get wet our best way  across  park” “this  so favourite  walk  mine” said miss tilney “that i always think   best  nearest way but perhaps  may  damp” it   narrow winding path through  thick grove  old scotch firs  catherine struck   gloomy aspect  eager  enter it could not even   general’s disapprobation  kept  stepping forward he perceived her inclination  having again urged  plea  health  vain  too polite  make further opposition he excused himself however  attending them “the rays   sun  not too

she began  talk  easy gaiety   delightful melancholy which such  grove inspired “i am particularly fond  this spot” said her companion   sigh “it  my mother’s favourite walk” catherine had never heard mrs tilney mentioned   family before   interest excited  this tender remembrance showed itself directly  her altered countenance    attentive pause  which she waited  something more “i used  walk here so often  her” added eleanor “though i never loved  then  i have loved  since at  time indeed i used  wonder  her choice but her memory endears  now” “and ought  not” reflected catherine “to endear   her husband yet  general would not enter it” miss tilney continuing silent she ventured  say “her death must have been  great affliction” “a great  increasing one” replied  other   low voice “i  only thirteen when  happened  though i felt my loss perhaps  strongly  one so young could feel it i did not i could not then know what  loss  was” she stopped   moment  then added  great firmness “i have no sister you know—and though henry—though my brothers  very affectionate  henry   great deal here which i am most thankful for   impossible  me not   often solitary” “to  sure you must miss him very much” “a mother would have been always present a mother would have been  constant friend her influence would have been beyond all other” “was she  very charming woman was she handsome was there any

catherine’s interest   deceased mrs tilney augmented  every question whether answered or not of her unhappiness  marriage she felt persuaded the general certainly had been  unkind husband he did not love her walk could  therefore have loved her and besides handsome   was there   something   turn  his features which spoke his not having behaved well  her “her picture i suppose” blushing   consummate art  her own question “hangs  your father’s room” “no   intended   drawingroom but my father  dissatisfied   painting   some time  had no place soon after her death i obtained   my own

attempted no longer  hide  herself  nature   feelings which  spite  all his attentions  had previously excited  what had been terror  dislike before  now absolute aversion yes aversion his cruelty  such  charming woman made him odious  her she had often read  such characters characters which mr allen had been used  call unnatural  overdrawn but here  proof positive   contrary she had just settled this point when  end   path brought them directly upon  general   spite  all her virtuous indignation she found herself again obliged  walk  him listen  him  even  smile when  smiled being no

her view “mr tilney” she exclaimed   voice  more than common astonishment he looked astonished too “good god” she continued not attending  his address “how came you here how came you up  staircase” “how came i up  staircase”  replied greatly surprised “because   my nearest way   stableyard  my own chamber  why should i not come up it” catherine recollected herself blushed deeply  could say no more he seemed   looking  her countenance   explanation which her lips did not afford she moved  towards  gallery “and may i not  my turn” said he   pushed back  folding doors “ask how you came here this passage   least  extraordinary  road   breakfastparlour  your apartment   staircase can    stables  mine” “i have been” said catherine looking down “to see your mother’s room” “my mother’s room is there anything extraordinary   seen there” “no nothing  all i thought you did not mean  come back till tomorrow” “i did not expect   able  return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had  pleasure  finding nothing  detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you  running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know—you  not aware  their leading   offices  common use” “no i  not you have had  very fine day  your ride” “very  does eleanor leave you  find your way into all  rooms   house  yourself” “oh no she showed me over  greatest part  saturday—and we  coming here  these rooms—but only”—dropping her voice—“your father   us” “and  prevented you” said henry earnestly regarding her “have you looked into all  rooms   passage” “no i only wanted  see—is not  very late i must go  dress” “it  only  quarter past four” showing his watch—“and you  not now  bath no theatre no rooms  prepare for half  hour  northanger must  enough” she could not contradict it  therefore suffered herself   detained though her dread  further questions made her   first time  their acquaintance wish  leave him they walked slowly up  gallery “have you had any letter  bath since i saw you” “no  i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully  write directly” “promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard   faithful performance but  faithful promise—the fidelity  promising it   power little worth knowing however since  can deceive  pain you my mother’s room  very commodious   not large  cheerfullooking   dressingclosets so well disposed it always

interesting her dying so suddenly” slowly   hesitation   spoken “and you—none  you being  home—and your father i thought—perhaps had not been very fond  her” “and  these circumstances”  replied his quick eye fixed  hers “you infer perhaps  probability  some negligence—some”—involuntarily she shook her head—“or  may be—of something still less pardonable” she raised her eyes towards him more fully

persuaded  well    possible  him to—we have not all you know  same tenderness  disposition—and i  not pretend  say  while she lived she might not often have had much  bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value  her  sincere and if not permanently   truly afflicted  her death” “i am very glad  it” said catherine “it would have been very shocking” “if i understand

this purpose “dear catherine “though god knows  little inclination  writing i think  my duty  tell you  everything    end between miss thorpe  me i left her  bath yesterday never  see either again i

through  whole letter saw plainly   ended no better than  began he  prevented however  even looking his surprise  his father’s entrance they went  breakfast directly but catherine could hardly eat anything tears filled her eyes  even ran down her cheeks  she sat the letter  one moment  her hand then  her lap  then  her pocket  she looked  if she knew not what she did the general between his cocoa  his newspaper had luckily no leisure  noticing her but   other two her distress  equally visible as soon  she dared leave  table she hurried away  her own room but  housemaids  busy  it  she  obliged  come down again she turned into  drawingroom  privacy but henry  eleanor had likewise retreated thither     moment deep  consultation about her she drew back trying  beg their pardon but was  gentle violence forced  return   others withdrew after eleanor had affectionately expressed  wish  being  use or comfort  her after half  hour’s free indulgence  grief  reflection catherine felt equal  encountering her friends but whether she should make her distress known  them  another consideration perhaps if particularly questioned she might just give  idea—just distantly hint  it—but not more to expose  friend such  friend  isabella had been  her—and then their own brother so closely concerned  it she believed she must waive  subject altogether henry  eleanor   themselves   breakfastroom  each  she entered it looked  her anxiously catherine took her place   table and after  short silence eleanor said “no bad news  fullerton i hope mr  mrs morland—your brothers  sisters—i hope they  none  them ill” “no i thank you” sighing  she spoke “they  all very well my letter   my brother  oxford” nothing further  said   few minutes  then speaking through her tears she added “i do not think i shall ever wish   letter again” “i am sorry” said henry closing  book  had just opened “if i had suspected  letter  containing anything unwelcome i should have given   very different feelings” “it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james  so unhappy you  soon know why” “to have so kindhearted so affectionate  sister” replied henry warmly “must   comfort  him under any distress” “i have one favour  beg” said catherine shortly afterwards   agitated manner “that if your brother should  coming here you  give me notice  it  i may go away” “our brother frederick” “yes i am sure i should  very sorry  leave you so soon but something  happened  would make  very dreadful  me     same house  captain tilney” eleanor’s work  suspended while she gazed  increasing astonishment but henry began  suspect  truth  something  which miss thorpe’s name  included passed his lips “how quick you are” cried catherine “you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about   bath you little thought   ending so isabella—no wonder now i have not heard  her—isabella  deserted my brother    marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy  fickleness  everything   bad   world” “i hope so far  concerns my brother you  misinformed i hope   not had any material share  bringing  mr morland’s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe  not probable i think you must  deceived so far i am very sorry  mr morland—sorry  anyone you love should  unhappy but my surprise would  greater  frederick’s marrying her than  any other part   story” “it  very true however you shall read james’s letter yourself stay—there  one part—” recollecting   blush  last line “will you take  trouble  reading  us  passages which concern my brother” “no read  yourself” cried catherine whose second thoughts  clearer “i do not know what i  thinking of” blushing again  she had blushed before “james only means  give me good advice” he gladly received  letter and having read  through  close attention returned  saying “well if     so i can only say  i am sorry  it frederick  not   first man who  chosen  wife  less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either   lover or  son” miss tilney  catherine’s invitation now read  letter likewise and having expressed also her concern  surprise began  inquire into miss thorpe’s connections  fortune “her mother   very good sort  woman”  catherine’s answer “what  her father” “a lawyer i believe they live  putney” “are they  wealthy family” “no not very i do not believe isabella  any fortune  all but   not signify  your family your father  so very liberal he told me  other day   only valued money   allowed him  promote  happiness  his children” the brother  sister looked  each other “but” said eleanor after  short pause “would    promote his happiness  enable him  marry such  girl she must   unprincipled one or she could not have used your brother so and how strange  infatuation  frederick’s side a girl who before his eyes  violating  engagement voluntarily entered into  another man is not  inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore his heart so proudly who found no woman good enough   loved” “that   most unpromising circumstance  strongest presumption against him when i think  his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good  opinion  miss thorpe’s prudence  suppose  she would part  one gentleman before  other  secured it  all over  frederick indeed he   deceased man—defunct  understanding prepare  your sisterinlaw eleanor  such  sisterinlaw  you must delight in open candid artless guileless  affections strong but simple forming no pretensions  knowing no disguise” “such  sisterinlaw henry i should delight in” said eleanor   smile “but perhaps” observed catherine “though she  behaved so ill  our family she may behave better  yours now she  really got  man she likes she may  constant” “indeed i am afraid she will” replied henry “i am afraid she   very constant unless  baronet should come  her way   frederick’s only chance i  get  bath paper  look over  arrivals” “you think   all  ambition then and upon my word there  some things  seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do  them she seemed quite disappointed    not more i never  so deceived  anyone’s character  my life before” “among all  great variety  you have known  studied” “my own disappointment  loss  her  very great but   poor james i suppose   hardly ever recover it” “your brother  certainly very much   pitied  present but we must not  our concern  his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose   losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel  void  your heart which nothing else can occupy society  becoming irksome     amusements  which you  wont  share  bath  very idea  them without her  abhorrent you would not  instance now go   ball   world you feel  you have no longer any friend  whom you can speak  unreserve  whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel  any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this” “no” said catherine after  few moments’ reflection “i do not—ought i to say  truth though i am hurt  grieved  i cannot still love her  i am never  hear  her perhaps never  see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted  one would have thought” “you feel  you always do what  most   credit  human nature such feelings ought   investigated  they may know themselves” catherine  some chance or other found her spirits so very much relieved  this conversation  she could not regret her being led on though so unaccountably  mention  circumstance which had produced it chapter  from this time  subject  frequently canvassed   three young people

think  such  thing after what  general said when  so particularly desired you not  give yourself any trouble because anything would do” henry only smiled “i am sure   quite unnecessary upon your

  only man i ever did or could love  i trust you  convince him  it the spring fashions  partly down   hats  most frightful you can imagine i hope you spend your time pleasantly but am afraid you never think  me i  not say all  i could   family you  with because i would not  ungenerous or set you against those you esteem but   very difficult  know whom  trust  young men never know their minds two days together i rejoice  say   young man whom  all others i particularly abhor  left bath you  know  this description i must mean captain tilney who  you may remember  amazingly disposed  follow  tease me before you went away afterwards  got worse  became quite my shadow many girls might have been taken in  never  such attentions but i knew  fickle sex too well he went away  his regiment two days ago  i trust i shall never  plagued  him again he   greatest coxcomb i ever saw  amazingly disagreeable the last two days   always   side  charlotte davis i pitied his taste but took no notice  him the last time we met   bath street  i turned directly into  shop   might not speak  me i would not even look  him he went into  pumproom afterwards but i would not have followed him  all  world such  contrast between him  your brother pray send me some news   latter—i am quite unhappy about him  seemed so uncomfortable when  went away   cold or something  affected his spirits i would write

but no matter—it  your dear brother’s favourite colour lose no time my dearest sweetest catherine  writing  him   me who ever am etc such  strain  shallow artifice could not impose even upon catherine its inconsistencies contradictions  falsehood struck her   very first she  ashamed  isabella  ashamed  having ever loved her her professions  attachment  now  disgusting  her excuses  empty  her demands impudent “write  james  her behalf no james should never hear isabella’s name mentioned  her again” on henry’s arrival  woodston she made known  him  eleanor their brother’s safety congratulating them  sincerity  it  reading aloud  most material passages  her letter  strong indignation when she had finished it—“so much  isabella” she cried “and  all our intimacy she must think me  idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this  served  make her character better known  me than mine   her i see what she  been about she   vain coquette  her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either  james or  me  i wish i had never known her” “it  soon   if you never had” said henry “there  but one thing  i cannot understand i see  she  had designs  captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney  been about all this time why should  pay her such attentions   make her quarrel  my brother  then fly off himself” “i have very little  say  frederick’s motives such  i believe them  have been he  his vanities  well  miss thorpe   chief difference is that having  stronger head they have not yet injured himself if  effect  his behaviour does not justify him  you we had better not seek after  cause” “then you do not suppose  ever really cared about her” “i am persuaded   never did” “and only made believe  do so  mischief’s sake” henry bowed his assent “well then i must say  i do not like him  all though   turned out so well  us i do not like him  all as  happens there  no great harm done because i do not think isabella  any heart  lose but suppose  had made her very much  love  him” “but we must first suppose isabella  have had  heart  lose—consequently  have been  very different creature and   case she would have met  very different treatment” “it  very right  you should stand  your brother” “and if you would stand  yours you would not  much distressed   disappointment  miss thorpe but your mind  warped   innate principle  general integrity  therefore not accessible   cool reasonings  family partiality or  desire  revenge” catherine  complimented out  further bitterness frederick could not  unpardonably guilty while henry made himself so agreeable she resolved  not answering isabella’s letter  tried  think no more  it chapter  soon after this  general found himself obliged  go  london   week   left northanger earnestly regretting  any necessity should rob him even   hour  miss morland’s company  anxiously recommending  study  her comfort  amusement  his children  their chief object

opportunity  being suddenly alone  eleanor   eleanor’s being   middle   speech about something very different  start forth her obligation  going away very soon eleanor looked  declared herself much concerned she had “hoped   pleasure  her company   much longer time—had been misled perhaps  her wishes  suppose   much longer visit had been promised—and could not but think  if mr  mrs morland  aware   pleasure    her  have her there they would  too generous  hasten her return” catherine explained “oh as  that papa  mamma   no hurry  all as long  she  happy they would always  satisfied” “then why might she ask  such  hurry herself  leave them” “oh because she had been there so long” “nay if you can use such  word i can urge you no farther if you think  long—” “oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay  you  long again” and   directly settled that till she had her leaving them  not even   thought of in having this cause  uneasiness so pleasantly removed  force   other  likewise weakened the kindness  earnestness  eleanor’s manner  pressing her  stay  henry’s gratified look  being told  her stay  determined  such sweet proofs  her importance  them  left her only just so much solicitude   human mind can never do comfortably without she did—almost always—believe  henry loved her  quite always  his father  sister loved  even wished her  belong  them

first perturbation  surprise had passed away   “good heaven what can   matter”   quickly decided  eleanor   her eldest brother whose arrival  often  sudden if not quite so unseasonable  accordingly she hurried down  welcome him catherine walked   her chamber making up her mind  well  she could   further acquaintance  captain tilney  comforting herself under  unpleasant impression his conduct had given her   persuasion  his being  far too fine  gentleman  approve  her   least they should not meet under such circumstances  would make their meeting materially painful she trusted  would never speak  miss thorpe  indeed   must  this time  ashamed   part  had acted there could  no danger  it   long  all mention  bath scenes  avoided she thought she could behave  him very civilly in such considerations time passed away    certainly  his favour  eleanor should  so glad  see him  have so much  say  half  hour  almost gone since his arrival  eleanor did not come up at  moment catherine thought she heard her step   gallery  listened   continuance but all  silent scarcely however had she convicted her fancy  error when  noise  something moving close  her door made her start  seemed  if someone  touching  very doorway—and  another moment  slight motion   lock proved  some hand must   it she trembled  little   idea  anyone’s approaching so cautiously but resolving not   again overcome  trivial appearances  alarm or misled   raised imagination she stepped quietly forward  opened  door eleanor  only eleanor stood there catherine’s spirits however  tranquillized but   instant  eleanor’s cheeks  pale  her manner greatly agitated though evidently intending  come in  seemed  effort  enter  room   still greater  speak when there catherine supposing some uneasiness  captain tilney’s account could only express her concern  silent attention obliged her   seated rubbed her temples  lavenderwater  hung over her  affectionate solicitude “my dear catherine you must not—you must not indeed—”  eleanor’s first connected words “i am quite well this kindness distracts me—i cannot bear it—i come  you  such  errand” “errand to me” “how shall i tell you oh how shall i tell you” a new idea now darted into catherine’s mind  turning  pale  her friend she exclaimed “’tis  messenger  woodston” “you  mistaken indeed” returned eleanor looking  her most compassionately “it  no one  woodston it  my father himself” her voice faltered  her eyes  turned   ground  she mentioned his name his unlookedfor return  enough  itself  make catherine’s heart sink    few moments she hardly supposed there  anything worse   told she said nothing  eleanor endeavouring  collect herself  speak  firmness but  eyes still cast down soon went on “you  too good i am sure  think  worse  me   part i am obliged  perform i am indeed  most unwilling messenger after what  so lately passed so lately been settled between us—how joyfully how thankfully  my side—as  your continuing here  i hoped  many many weeks longer how can i tell you  your kindness  not   accepted—and   happiness your company  hitherto given us    repaid by—but i must not trust myself  words my dear catherine we   part my father  recollected  engagement  takes our whole family away  monday we  going  lord longtown’s near hereford   fortnight explanation  apology  equally impossible i cannot attempt either” “my dear eleanor” cried catherine suppressing her feelings  well  she could “do not  so distressed a second engagement must give way   first i am very very sorry we   part—so soon  so suddenly too but i am not offended indeed i am not i can finish my visit here you know  any time or i hope you  come  me can you when you return  this lord’s come  fullerton” “it  not   my power catherine” “come when you can then” eleanor made no answer  catherine’s thoughts recurring  something more directly interesting she added thinking aloud “monday—so soon  monday  you all go well i am certain of—i shall  able  take leave however i need not go till just before you do you know do not  distressed eleanor i can go  monday very well my father  mother’s having no notice     very little consequence the general  send  servant  me i dare say half  way—and then i shall soon   salisbury  then i am only nine miles  home” “ah catherine were  settled so  would  somewhat less intolerable though  such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought but—how can i tell you—tomorrow morning  fixed  your leaving us  not even  hour  left  your choice  very carriage  ordered    here  seven o’clock  no servant   offered you” catherine sat down breathless  speechless “i could hardly believe my senses when i heard it  no displeasure no resentment  you can feel  this moment however justly great can  more than i myself—but i must not talk  what i felt oh that i could suggest anything  extenuation good god what  your father  mother say after courting you   protection  real friends  this—almost double distance  your home  have you driven out   house without  considerations even  decent civility dear dear catherine  being  bearer  such  message i seem guilty myself  all  insult yet i trust you  acquit me  you must have been long enough  this house  see  i am but  nominal mistress  it  my real power  nothing” “have i offended  general” said catherine   faltering voice “alas for my feelings   daughter all  i know all  i answer for   you can have given him no just cause  offence he certainly  greatly very greatly discomposed i have seldom seen him more so his temper  not happy  something  now occurred  ruffle    uncommon degree some disappointment some vexation which just  this moment seems important but which i can hardly suppose you  have any concern in  how   possible” it   pain  catherine could speak  all    only  eleanor’s sake  she attempted it “i am sure” said she “i am very sorry if i have offended him it   last thing i would willingly have done but do not  unhappy eleanor an engagement you know must  kept i am only sorry   not recollected sooner  i might have written home but    very little consequence” “i hope i earnestly hope   your real safety     none but  everything else     greatest consequence  comfort appearance propriety  your family   world were your friends  allens still  bath you might go  them  comparative ease  few hours would take you there but  journey  seventy miles   taken post  you  your age alone unattended” “oh  journey  nothing do not think about that and if we   part  few hours sooner or later you know makes no difference i can  ready  seven let me  called  time” eleanor saw  she wished   alone  believing  better  each  they should avoid any further conversation now left her with “i shall see you   morning” catherine’s swelling heart needed relief in eleanor’s presence friendship  pride had equally restrained her tears but no sooner  she gone than they burst forth  torrents turned   house   such  way without any reason  could justify any apology  could atone   abruptness  rudeness nay  insolence  it henry   distance—not able even  bid him farewell every hope every expectation  him suspended  least

cried “you must let me hear  you  soon  possible till i know you   safe  home i shall not have  hour’s comfort for one letter  all risks all hazards i must entreat let me have  satisfaction  knowing

irritable race far  any quickness  catching or bitterness  resenting affronts but here when  whole  unfolded   insult not   overlooked nor   first half hour   easily pardoned without suffering any romantic alarm   consideration  their daughter’s long  lonely journey mr  mrs morland could not but feel   might have been productive  much unpleasantness  her    what they could never have voluntarily suffered  that  forcing her  such  measure general tilney had acted neither honourably nor feelingly—neither   gentleman nor   parent why  had done it what could have provoked him  such  breach  hospitality  so suddenly turned all his partial regard  their daughter into actual ill will   matter which they   least  far  divining  catherine herself but  did not oppress them  any means so long and after  due course  useless conjecture  “it   strange business    must   very strange man” grew enough  all their indignation  wonder though sarah indeed still indulged   sweets  incomprehensibility exclaiming  conjecturing  youthful ardour “my dear you give yourself  great deal  needless trouble” said her mother  last “depend upon it   something not  all worth understanding” “i can allow  his wishing catherine away when  recollected this engagement” said sarah “but why not do  civilly” “i am sorry   young people” returned mrs morland “they must have  sad time  it but   anything else   no matter now catherine  safe  home  our comfort does not depend upon general tilney” catherine sighed “well” continued her philosophic mother “i am glad i did not know  your journey   time but now   all over perhaps there  no great harm done it  always good  young people   put upon exerting themselves  you know my dear catherine you always   sad little scatterbrained creature but now you must have been forced  have your wits about you  so much changing  chaises  so forth  i hope   appear  you have not left anything behind you  any   pockets” catherine hoped so too  tried  feel  interest  her own amendment but her spirits  quite worn down and   silent  alone becoming soon her only wish she readily agreed  her mother’s next counsel  going early  bed her parents seeing nothing  her ill looks  agitation but  natural consequence  mortified feelings    unusual exertion  fatigue  such  journey parted  her without any doubt  their being soon slept away  though when they all met  next morning her recovery  not equal  their hopes they  still perfectly unsuspicious  there being any deeper evil they never once thought  her heart which   parents   young lady  seventeen just returned  her first excursion  home  odd enough as soon  breakfast  over she sat down  fulfil her promise  miss tilney whose trust   effect  time  distance  her friend’s disposition  already justified  already did catherine reproach herself  having parted  eleanor coldly  having never enough valued her merits or kindness  never enough commiserated her  what she had been yesterday left  endure the strength  these feelings however  far  assisting her pen  never had  been harder  her  write than  addressing eleanor tilney to compose  letter which might  once do justice  her sentiments  her situation convey gratitude without servile regret  guarded without coldness  honest without resentment—a letter which eleanor might not  pained   perusal of—and above all which she might not blush herself if henry should chance  see   undertaking  frighten away all her powers  performance and after long thought  much perplexity   very brief  all  she could determine   any confidence  safety the money therefore which eleanor had advanced  enclosed  little more than grateful thanks   thousand good wishes   most affectionate heart “this  been  strange acquaintance” observed mrs morland   letter  finished “soon made  soon ended i am sorry  happens so  mrs allen thought them very pretty kind  young people  you  sadly out  luck too  your isabella ah poor james well we must live  learn   next new friends you make i hope   better worth keeping” catherine coloured  she warmly answered “no friend can  better worth keeping than eleanor” “if so my dear i dare say you  meet again some time or other do not  uneasy it  ten  one but you  thrown together again   course   few years  then what  pleasure   be” mrs morland  not happy  her attempt  consolation the hope  meeting again   course   few years could only put into catherine’s head what might happen within  time  make  meeting dreadful  her she could never forget henry tilney or think  him  less tenderness than she did   moment but  might forget her    case  meet— her eyes filled  tears  she pictured her acquaintance so renewed  her mother perceiving her comfortable suggestions  have had no good effect proposed  another expedient  restoring her spirits  they should call  mrs allen the two houses  only  quarter   mile apart and  they walked mrs morland quickly dispatched all  she felt   score  james’s disappointment “we  sorry  him” said she “but otherwise there  no harm done   match going off   could not   desirable thing  have him engaged   girl whom we had not  smallest acquaintance with  who  so entirely without fortune  now after such behaviour we cannot think  all well  her just  present  comes hard  poor james but   not last forever  i dare say     discreeter man all his life   foolishness  his first choice” this  just such  summary view   affair  catherine could listen to another sentence might have endangered her complaisance  made her reply less rational  soon  all her thinking powers swallowed up   reflection  her own change  feelings  spirits since last she had trodden  wellknown road it  not three months ago since wild  joyful expectation she had there run backwards  forwards some ten times  day   heart light gay  independent looking forward  pleasures untasted  unalloyed  free   apprehension  evil    knowledge  it three months ago had seen her all this  now how altered  being did she return she  received   allens  all  kindness which her unlookedfor appearance acting   steady affection would naturally call forth  great  their surprise  warm their displeasure  hearing how she had been treated—though mrs morland’s account    no inflated representation no studied appeal  their passions “catherine took us quite  surprise yesterday evening” said she “she travelled all  way post  herself  knew nothing  coming till saturday night  general tilney  some odd fancy or other all   sudden grew tired  having her there  almost turned her out   house very unfriendly certainly   must   very odd man but we  so glad  have her amongst us again and    great comfort  find  she  not  poor helpless creature but can shift very well  herself” mr allen expressed himself   occasion   reasonable resentment   sensible friend  mrs allen thought his expressions quite good enough   immediately made use  again  herself his wonder his conjectures  his explanations became  succession hers   addition  this single remark—“i really have not patience   general”—to fill up every accidental pause and “i really have not patience   general”  uttered twice after mr allen left  room without any relaxation  anger or any material digression  thought a more considerable degree  wandering attended  third repetition and after completing  fourth she immediately added “only think my dear  my having got  frightful great rent  my best mechlin so charmingly mended before i left bath  one can hardly see where  was i must show  you some day or other bath   nice place catherine after all i assure you i did not above half like coming away mrs thorpe’s being there  such  comfort  us  not it you know you  i  quite forlorn  first” “yes but that did not last long” said catherine her eyes brightening   recollection  what had first given spirit  her existence there “very true we soon met  mrs thorpe  then we wanted  nothing my dear do not you think these silk gloves wear very well i put them  new  first time  our going   lower rooms you know  i have worn them  great deal since do you remember  evening” “do i oh perfectly” “it  very agreeable  not it mr tilney drank tea  us  i always thought him  great addition   so very agreeable i have  notion you danced  him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on” catherine could not answer and after  short trial  other subjects mrs allen again returned to—“i really have not patience   general such  agreeable worthy man   seemed  be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw  betterbred man  your life his lodgings  taken  very day after  left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know” as they walked home again mrs morland endeavoured  impress  her daughter’s mind  happiness  having such steady wellwishers  mr  mrs allen   very little consideration which  neglect or unkindness  slight acquaintance like  tilneys ought  have  her while she could preserve  good opinion  affection  her earliest friends there   great deal  good sense  all this but there  some situations   human mind  which good sense  very little power  catherine’s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced it  upon  behaviour  these very slight acquaintance  all her present happiness depended  while mrs morland  successfully confirming her own opinions   justness  her own representations catherine  silently reflecting  now henry must have arrived  northanger now  must have heard  her departure  now perhaps they  all setting off  hereford chapter  catherine’s disposition  not naturally sedentary nor had her habits been ever very industrious but whatever might hitherto have been her defects   sort her mother could not but perceive them now   greatly increased she could neither sit still nor employ herself  ten minutes together walking round  garden  orchard again  again  if nothing but motion  voluntary   seemed  if she could even walk about  house rather than remain fixed  any time   parlour her loss  spirits   yet greater alteration in her rambling  her idleness she might only   caricature  herself but  her silence  sadness she   very reverse  all  she had been before for two days mrs morland allowed   pass even without  hint but when  third night’s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness improved her  useful activity nor given her  greater inclination  needlework she could no longer refrain   gentle reproof of “my dear catherine i am afraid you  growing quite  fine lady i do not know when poor richard’s cravats would  done if  had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there   time  everything—a time  balls  plays   time  work you have had  long run  amusement  now you must try   useful” catherine took up her work directly saying   dejected voice  “her head did not run upon bath—much” “then you  fretting about general tilney    very simple  you  ten  one whether you ever see him again you should never fret about trifles” after  short silence—“i hope my catherine you  not getting out  humour  home because   not so grand  northanger that would  turning your visit into  evil indeed wherever you  you should always  contented but especially  home because there you must spend  most  your time i did not quite like  breakfast  hear you talk so much about  french bread  northanger” “i am sure i do not care about  bread it  all  same  me what i eat” “there   very clever essay  one   books upstairs upon much such  subject about young girls  have been spoilt  home  great acquaintance—the mirror i think i  look  out  you some day or other because i am sure   do you good” catherine said no more and   endeavour  do right applied  her work but after  few minutes sunk again without knowing  herself into languor  listlessness moving herself  her chair   irritation  weariness much oftener than she moved her needle mrs morland watched  progress  this relapse  seeing  her daughter’s absent  dissatisfied look  full proof   repining spirit  which she had now begun  attribute her want  cheerfulness hastily left  room  fetch  book  question anxious  lose no time  attacking so dreadful  malady it  some time before she could find what she looked for
