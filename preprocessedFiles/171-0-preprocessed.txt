charlotte  not like  unfeeling mrs crayton shut our hearts   call  humanity chapter xxix we go forward again the strength  charlottes constitution combatted against her disorder  she began slowly  recover though she still laboured under  violent depression  spirits how must  depression  encreased when upon examining her little store she found herself reduced  one solitary guinea   during her illness  attendance   apothecary  nurse together  many other unavoidable expences had involved her  debt  which she saw no method  extricating herself as   faint hope which she had entertained  hearing   being relieved  her parents  now entirely forsook her    above four months since her letter  dispatched  she had received no answer she therefore imagined  her conduct had either entirely alienated their affection  her or broken their hearts  she must never more hope  receive their blessing never did any human being wish  death  greater fervency or  juster cause yet she had too just  sense   duties   christian religion  attempt  put  period  her own existence “i have but   patient  little longer” she would cry “and nature fatigued  fainting  throw off this heavy load  mortality  i shall  released  all my sufferings” it  one cold stormy day   latter end  december  charlotte sat   handful  fire  low state  her finances not allowing her  replenish her stock  fuel  prudence teaching her   careful  what she had when she  surprised   entrance   farmers wife who without much ceremony seated herself  began this curious harangue “im come  see if  how you can pay your rent because  how we hear captain montable  gone away  its fifty  one if  bant killed afore  comes back again  then miss or maam or whatever you may be  i  saying  my husband where  we  look  our money” this   stroke altogether unexpected  charlotte she knew so little   ways   world  she had never bestowed  thought   payment   rent   house she knew indeed  she owed  good deal but this  never reckoned among  others she  thunderstruck she hardly knew what answer  make yet   absolutely necessary  she should say something  judging   gentleness  every female disposition  her own she thought  best way

tremulous accent “i am   loss what  do montraville placed me here  promised  defray all my expenses but   forgot his promise   forsaken me  i have no friend who  either power or   relieve me let me hope  you see my unhappy situation your charity” “charity” cried  woman impatiently interrupting her “charity indeed why mistress charity begins  home  i have seven children  home honest lawful

name a charm  lulls  sleep a shade  follows wealth  fame but leaves  wretch  weep when charlotte  left  herself she began  think what course she must take or  whom she could apply  prevent her perishing  want or perhaps  very night falling  victim   inclemency   season after many perplexed thoughts she  last determined  set out  newyork  enquire out mrs crayton  whom she had no doubt but she should obtain immediate relief  soon  her distress  made known she had no sooner formed this resolution than she resolved immediately  put   execution she therefore wrote  following little billet  mrs crayton thinking if she should have company  her  would  better  send   than  request  see her to mrs crayton “madam “when we left our native land  dear happy land which now contains all   dear   wretched charlotte our prospects   same we both pardon me madam if i say we both too easily followed  impulse  our treacherous hearts  trusted our happiness   tempestuous ocean where mine  been

benighted soul while i reflect  you cannot  not refuse your protection   heartbroken charlotte” when charlotte had finished this letter late      afternoon  though  snow began  fall very fast she tied up  few necessaries which she had prepared against her expected confinement  terrified lest she should  again exposed   insults  her barbarous landlady more dreadful  her wounded spirit than either storm or darkness she set forward  newyork it may  asked  those who   work  this kind love  cavil  every trifling omission whether charlotte did not possess any valuable  which she could have disposed    means have supported herself till mrs beauchamps return when she would have been certain  receiving every tender attention which compassion  friendship could dictate but let me entreat these wise penetrating gentlemen  reflect  when charlotte left england    such haste  there  no time  purchase any thing more than what  wanted  immediate use   voyage  after her arrival  newyork montravilles affection soon began  decline so  her whole wardrobe consisted  only necessaries    baubles  which fond lovers often load their mistresses she possessed not one except  plain gold locket  small value

then  your leave i  proceed the distance   house which our suffering heroine occupied  newyork  not very great yet  snow fen so fast   cold so intense that being unable  her situation  walk quick she found herself almost sinking  cold  fatigue before she reached  town her garments which  merely suitable   summer season being  undress robe  plain white muslin  wet through   thin black cloak  bonnet very improper habiliments  such  climate but poorly defended her   cold in this situation she reached  city  enquired   foot soldier whom she met  way  colonel craytons “bless you my sweet lady” said  soldier   voice  look  compassion “i  shew you  way  all my heart but if you  going  make  petition  madam crayton   all  no purpose i assure you if you please i  conduct you  mr franklins though miss

so good  us all    miss julia all  poor folk almost worshipped her” “gracious heaven” cried charlotte “is montraville unjust then  none but me” the soldier now shewed her colonel craytons door and   beating heart she knocked  admission chapter xxxi subject continued when  door  opened charlotte   voice rendered scarcely articulate through cold   extreme agitation  her mind demanded whether mrs crayton   home the servant hesitated  knew  his lady  engaged   game  picquet  her dear corydon nor could  think she would like   disturbed   person whose appearance spoke her  so little consequence  charlotte yet there  something  her countenance  rather interested him  her favour   said his lady  engaged but if she had any particular message  would deliver it “take up this letter” said charlotte “tell her  unhappy writer   waits  her hall   answer” the tremulous accent  tearful eye must have moved any heart not composed  adamant the man took  letter   poor suppliant  hastily ascended  stair case “a letter madam” said he presenting   his lady “an immediate answer  required” mrs crayton glanced her eye carelessly over  contents “what stuff  this” cried she haughtily “have not i told you  thousand times  i  not  plagued  beggars  petitions  people one knows nothing about go tell  woman i cant do any thing  it im sorry but one cant relieve every body” the servant bowed  heavily returned  this chilling message  charlotte “surely” said she “mrs crayton  not read my letter go my good friend pray go back  her tell her   charlotte temple who requests beneath her hospitable roof  find shelter   inclemency   season” “prithee dont plague me man” cried mrs crayton impatiently   servant advanced something  behalf   unhappy girl “i tell you i dont know her” “not know me” cried charlotte rushing into  room for she had followed  man up stairs “not know me not remember  ruined charlotte temple who but  you perhaps might still have been innocent still have been happy oh la rue this  beyond every thing i could have believed possible” “upon my honour miss” replied  unfeeling woman   utmost effrontery “this   most unaccountable address   beyond my comprehension john” continued she turning   servant “the young woman  certainly out  her senses do pray take her away she terrifies me  death” “oh god” cried charlotte clasping her hands   agony “this  too much what  become  me but i  not leave you they shall not tear me  you here  my knees i conjure you  save me  perishing   streets if you really have forgot me oh  charitys sweet sake this night let me  sheltered   winters piercing cold” the kneeling figure  charlotte  her affecting situation might have moved  heart   stoic  compassion but mrs crayton remained inflexible in vain did charlotte recount  time they had known each other  chichester  vain mention their being   same ship  vain   names  montraville  belcour mentioned mrs crayton could only say she  sorry  her imprudence but could not think  having her own reputation endangered  encouraging  woman   kind  her own house besides she did not know what trouble  expense she might bring upon her husband  giving shelter   woman  her situation “i can  least die here” said charlotte “i feel i cannot long survive this dreadful conflict father  mercy here let me finish my existence” her agonizing sensations overpowered her  she fell senseless   floor “take her away” said mrs crayton “she  really frighten me into hysterics take her away i say this instant” “and where must i take  poor creature” said  servant   voice  look  compassion “any where” cried she hastily “only dont let me ever see her again i declare she  flurried me so i shant  myself again this fortnight” john assisted  his fellowservant raised  carried her down stairs “poor soul” said he “you shall not lay   street this night i have  bed   poor little hovel where my wife  her little ones rest them but they shall watch  night  you shall  sheltered  danger” they placed her   chair

mentioning  cruel conduct  their lady   poor distressed lunatic who claimed her protection every one joined  reprobating her inhumanity nay even corydon thought she might  least have ordered her   taken care of but  dare not even hint   her   lived but  her smiles  drew  her lavish fondness large sums  support  extravagance  which  state  his own finances  very inadequate  cannot therefore  supposed   wished mrs crayton   very liberal  her bounty   afflicted suppliant yet vice had not so entirely seared over his heart but  sorrows  charlotte could find  vulnerable part charlotte had now been three days  her humane preservers but she  totally insensible  every thing she raved incessantly  montraville  her father she  not conscious  being  mother nor took  least notice  her child except  ask whose  was  why   not carried   parents “oh” said she one day starting up  hearing  infant cry “why why  you keep  child here i am sure you would not if you knew how hard     mother   parted  her infant   like tearing  cords  life asunder oh could you see  horrid sight which i now beholdthere there stands my dear mother her poor bosom bleeding  every vein her gentle affectionate heart torn   thousand pieces  all   loss   ruined ungrateful child save me save mefrom her frown i dare notindeed i dare not speak  her” such   dreadful images  haunted her distracted mind  nature  sinking fast under  dreadful malady which medicine had no power  remove the surgeon who attended her   humane man  exerted his utmost abilities  save her but  saw she   want  many necessaries  comforts which  poverty  her hospitable host rendered him unable  provide  therefore determined  make her situation known  some   officers ladies  endeavour  make  collection  her relief when  returned home after making this resolution  found  message  mrs beauchamp who had just arrived  rhodeisland requesting  would call  see one  her children who  very unwell “i do not know” said he    hastening  obey  summons “i do not know  woman  whom i could apply  more hope  success than mrs beauchamp i  endeavour  interest her  this poor girls behalf she wants  soothing balm  friendly consolation we may perhaps save her we  try  least” “and where  she” cried mrs beauchamp when  had prescribed something   child  told his little pathetic tale “where  she sir we  go  her immediately heaven forbid  i should  deaf   calls  humanity come we  go this instant” then seizing  doctors arm they sought  habitation  contained  dying charlotte chapter xxxiii which people void of feeling need not read when mrs beauchamp entered  apartment   poor sufferer she started back  horror on  wretched bed without hangings  but poorly supplied  covering lay  emaciated figure  what still retained  semblance   lovely woman though sickness had so altered her features  mrs beauchamp had not  least recollection  her person in one corner   room stood  woman washing and shivering over  small fire two healthy but half naked children  infant  asleep beside  mother and   chair   bed side stood  porrenger  wooden spoon containing  little gruel   teacup  about two spoonfulls  wine  it mrs beauchamp had never before beheld such  scene  poverty she shuddered involuntarily  exclaiming“heaven preserve us” leaned   back   chair ready  sink   earth the doctor repented having so precipitately brought her into this affecting scene but there  no time  apologies charlotte caught  sound  her voice  starting almost out  bed exclaimed“angel  peace  mercy art thou come  deliver me oh i know you are  whenever you  near me i felt eased  half my sorrows but you dont know me nor can i  all  recollection i am mistress of remember your name just now but i know  benevolent countenance   softness   voice which  so often comforted  wretched charlotte” mrs beauchamp had during  time charlotte  speaking seated herself   bed  taken one  her hands she looked  her attentively    name  charlotte she perfectly conceived  whole shocking affair a faint sickness came over her “gracious heaven” said she “is this possible”  bursting into tears she reclined  burning head  charlotte  her own bosom  folding her arms about her wept over her  silence “oh” said charlotte “you  very good  weep thus  me    long time since i shed  tear  myself my head  heart  both  fire but these tears  yours seem  cool  refresh it oh now i remember you said you would send  letter  my poor father do you think  ever received it or perhaps you have brought me  answer why dont you speak madam does  say i may go home well   very

put  end  these delusive hopes  said nature  making her last effort   few hours would most probably consign  unhappy girl  her kindred dust being asked how she found herself she replied“why better
