 thing they  sending us  thing    bring so much struggle  calamity  death   earth i never dreamed   then  i watched no one  earth dreamed   unerring missile that night too there  another jetting out  gas   distant planet i saw it a reddish flash   edge  slightest projection   outline just   chronometer struck midnight    i told ogilvy   took my place the night  warm  i  thirsty  i went stretching

look up   night sky i saw nothing  it yet this strangest  all things  ever came  earth  outer space must have fallen while i  sitting there visible  me had i only looked up   passed some  those who saw  flight say  travelled   hissing sound i myself heard nothing  that many people  berkshire surrey  middlesex must have seen  fall  it and  most have thought  another meteorite had descended no one seems  have troubled  look   fallen mass  night but very early   morning poor ogilvy who had seen  shooting star  who  persuaded   meteorite lay somewhere   common between horsell ottershaw  woking rose early   idea  finding it find   did soon after dawn  not far   sandpits an enormous hole had been made   impact   projectile   sand  gravel had been flung violently  every direction over  heath forming heaps visible  mile   half away the heather   fire eastward   thin blue smoke rose against  dawn the thing itself lay almost entirely buried  sand amidst  scattered splinters   fir tree  had shivered  fragments   descent the uncovered part had  appearance   huge cylinder caked over   outline softened   thick scaly duncoloured incrustation it had  diameter  about thirty yards he approached  mass surprised   size  more so   shape since most meteorites  rounded more or less completely it was however still so hot   flight through  air   forbid his near approach a stirring noise within  cylinder  ascribed   unequal cooling   surface    time  had not occurred  him   might  hollow he remained standing   edge   pit   thing had made  itself staring   strange appearance astonished chiefly   unusual shape  colour  dimly perceiving even then some evidence  design   arrival the early morning  wonderfully still   sun just clearing  pine trees towards weybridge  already warm he did not remember hearing any birds  morning there  certainly no breeze stirring   only sounds   faint movements  within  cindery cylinder he  all alone   common then suddenly  noticed   start  some   grey clinker  ashy incrustation  covered  meteorite  falling off  circular edge   end it  dropping off  flakes  raining down upon  sand a large piece suddenly came off  fell   sharp noise  brought his heart into his mouth for  minute  scarcely realised what this meant and although  heat  excessive  clambered down into  pit close   bulk  see  thing more clearly he fancied even then   cooling   body might account  this but what disturbed  idea   fact   ash  falling only   end   cylinder and then  perceived that very slowly  circular top   cylinder  rotating   body it  such  gradual movement   discovered  only through noticing   black mark  had been near him five minutes ago  now   other side   circumference even then  scarcely understood what this indicated until  heard  muffled grating sound  saw  black mark jerk forward  inch or so then  thing came upon him   flash the cylinder  artificial—hollow—with  end  screwed out something within  cylinder  unscrewing  top “good heavens” said ogilvy “there’s  man  it—men  it half roasted  death trying  escape” at once   quick mental leap  linked  thing   flash upon mars the thought   confined creature  so dreadful  him   forgot  heat  went forward   cylinder  help turn but luckily  dull radiation arrested him before  could burn his hands   stillglowing metal at   stood irresolute   moment then turned scrambled out   pit  set off running wildly into woking the time then must have been somewhere about six o’clock he met  waggoner  tried  make him understand but  tale  told  his appearance  so wild—his hat had fallen off   pit—that  man simply drove on he  equally unsuccessful   potman who  just unlocking  doors   publichouse  horsell bridge the fellow thought    lunatic  large  made  unsuccessful attempt  shut him into  taproom that sobered him  little  when  saw henderson  london journalist  his garden  called over  palings  made himself understood “henderson”  called “you saw  shooting star last night” “well” said henderson “it’s out  horsell common now” “good lord” said henderson “fallen meteorite that’s good” “but it’s something more than  meteorite it’s  cylinder—an artificial cylinder man and there’s something inside” henderson stood up  his spade  his hand “what’s that”  said he  deaf  one ear ogilvy told him all   had seen henderson   minute or so taking  in then  dropped his spade snatched up his jacket  came out into  road the two men hurried back  once   common  found  cylinder still lying   same position but now  sounds inside had ceased   thin circle  bright metal showed between  top   body   cylinder air  either entering or escaping   rim   thin sizzling sound they listened rapped   scaly burnt metal   stick and meeting  no response they both concluded  man or men inside must  insensible or dead of course  two  quite unable  do anything they shouted consolation  promises  went off back   town again  get help one can imagine them covered  sand excited  disordered running up  little street   bright sunlight just   shop folks  taking down their shutters  people  opening their bedroom windows henderson went into  railway station  once  order  telegraph  news  london the newspaper articles had prepared men’s minds   reception   idea by eight o’clock  number  boys  unemployed men had already started   common  see  “dead men  mars” that   form  story took i heard   first  my newspaper boy about  quarter  nine when i went out  get my daily chronicle i  naturally startled  lost no time  going out  across  ottershaw bridge   sandpits iii on horsell common i found  little crowd  perhaps twenty people surrounding  huge hole  which  cylinder lay i have already described  appearance   colossal bulk embedded   ground the turf  gravel about  seemed charred  if   sudden explosion no doubt  impact had caused  flash  fire henderson  ogilvy  not there i think they perceived  nothing    done   present  had gone away  breakfast  henderson’s house there  four or five boys sitting   edge   pit  their feet dangling  amusing themselves—until i stopped them—by throwing stones   giant mass after i had spoken  them about it they began playing  “touch”   out   group  bystanders among these   couple  cyclists  jobbing gardener i employed sometimes  girl carrying  baby gregg  butcher  his little boy  two or three loafers  golf caddies who  accustomed  hang about  railway station there  very little talking few   common people  england had anything but  vaguest astronomical ideas  those days most  them  staring quietly   big table like end   cylinder which  still  ogilvy  henderson had left it i fancy  popular expectation   heap  charred corpses  disappointed  this inanimate bulk some went away while i  there  other people came i clambered into  pit  fancied i heard  faint movement under my feet the top had certainly ceased  rotate it  only when i got thus close     strangeness  this object   all evident  me at  first glance   really no more exciting than  overturned carriage or  tree blown across  road not so much so indeed it looked like  rusty gas float it required  certain amount  scientific education  perceive   grey scale   thing  no common oxide   yellowishwhite metal  gleamed   crack between  lid   cylinder had  unfamiliar hue “extraterrestrial” had no meaning  most   onlookers at  time   quite clear  my own mind   thing had come   planet mars but i judged  improbable   contained any living creature i thought  unscrewing might  automatic in spite  ogilvy i still believed  there  men  mars my mind ran fancifully   possibilities   containing manuscript   difficulties  translation  might arise whether we should find coins  models  it  so forth yet    little too large  assurance  this idea i felt  impatience  see  opened about eleven  nothing seemed happening i walked back full  such thought  my home  maybury but i found  difficult  get  work upon my abstract investigations in  afternoon  appearance   common had altered very much the early editions   evening papers had startled london  enormous headlines “a message received from mars” “remarkable story from woking”  so forth in addition ogilvy’s wire   astronomical exchange had roused every observatory   three kingdoms there  half  dozen flys or more   woking station standing   road   sandpits  basketchaise  chobham   rather lordly carriage besides that there  quite  heap  bicycles in addition  large number  people must have walked  spite   heat   day  woking  chertsey so  there  altogether quite  considerable crowd—one or two gaily dressed ladies among  others it  glaringly hot not  cloud   sky nor  breath  wind   only shadow     few scattered pine trees the burning heather had been extinguished but  level ground towards ottershaw  blackened  far  one could see  still giving off vertical streamers  smoke an enterprising sweetstuff dealer   chobham road had sent up his son   barrowload  green apples  ginger beer going   edge   pit i found  occupied   group  about half  dozen men—henderson ogilvy   tall fairhaired man  i afterwards learned  stent  astronomer royal  several workmen wielding spades  pickaxes stent  giving directions   clear highpitched voice he  standing   cylinder which  now evidently much cooler his face  crimson  streaming  perspiration  something seemed  have irritated him a large portion   cylinder had been uncovered though  lower end  still embedded as soon  ogilvy saw me among  staring crowd   edge   pit  called  me  come down  asked me if i would mind going over  see lord hilton  lord   manor the growing crowd  said  becoming  serious impediment  their excavations especially  boys they wanted  light railing put up  help  keep  people back he told me   faint stirring  occasionally still audible within  case but   workmen had failed  unscrew  top   afforded no grip  them the case appeared   enormously thick    possible   faint sounds we heard represented  noisy tumult   interior i  very glad  do   asked  so become one   privileged spectators within  contemplated enclosure i failed  find lord hilton  his house but i  told   expected  london   six o’clock train  waterloo     then about  quarter past five i went home had some tea  walked up   station  waylay him iv the cylinder opens when i returned   common  sun  setting scattered groups  hurrying   direction  woking  one or two persons  returning the crowd about  pit had increased  stood out black against  lemon yellow   sky—a couple  hundred people perhaps there  raised voices  some sort  struggle appeared   going  about  pit strange imaginings passed through my mind as i drew nearer i heard stent’s voice “keep back keep back” a boy came running towards me “it’s amovin’”  said  me   passed “ascrewin’  ascrewin’ out i don’t like it i’m agoin’ ’ome i am” i went    crowd there  really i should think two or three hundred people elbowing  jostling one another  one or two ladies there being  no means  least active “he’s fallen   pit” cried some one “keep back” said several the crowd swayed  little  i elbowed my way through every one seemed greatly excited i heard  peculiar humming sound   pit “i say” said ogilvy “help keep these idiots back we don’t know what’s   confounded thing you know” i saw  young man  shop assistant  woking i believe  was standing   cylinder  trying  scramble out   hole again the crowd had pushed him in the end   cylinder  being screwed out  within nearly two feet  shining screw projected somebody blundered against me  i narrowly missed being pitched onto  top   screw i turned   i did so  screw must have come out   lid   cylinder fell upon  gravel   ringing concussion i stuck my elbow into  person behind me  turned my head towards  thing again for  moment  circular cavity seemed perfectly black i had  sunset  my eyes i think everyone expected  see  man emerge—possibly something  little unlike us terrestrial men but  all essentials  man i know i did but looking i presently saw something stirring within  shadow greyish billowy movements one above another  then two luminous disks—like eyes then something resembling  little grey snake about  thickness   walking stick coiled up out   writhing middle  wriggled   air towards me—and then another a sudden chill came over me there   loud shriek   woman behind i half turned keeping my eyes fixed upon  cylinder still  which other tentacles  now projecting  began pushing my way back   edge   pit i saw astonishment giving place  horror   faces   people about me i heard inarticulate exclamations  all sides there   general movement backwards i saw  shopman struggling still   edge   pit i found myself alone  saw  people   other side   pit running off stent among them i looked again   cylinder  ungovernable terror gripped me i stood petrified  staring a big greyish rounded bulk  size perhaps   bear  rising slowly  painfully out   cylinder as  bulged up  caught  light  glistened like wet leather two large darkcoloured eyes  regarding me steadfastly the mass  framed them  head   thing  rounded  had one might say  face there   mouth under  eyes  lipless brim  which quivered  panted  dropped saliva the whole creature heaved  pulsated convulsively a lank tentacular appendage gripped  edge   cylinder another swayed   air those who have never seen  living martian can scarcely imagine  strange horror   appearance the peculiar vshaped mouth   pointed upper lip  absence  brow ridges  absence   chin beneath  wedgelike lower lip  incessant quivering  this mouth  gorgon groups  tentacles  tumultuous breathing   lungs   strange atmosphere  evident heaviness  painfulness  movement due   greater gravitational energy   earth—above all  extraordinary intensity   immense eyes—were  once vital intense inhuman crippled  monstrous there  something fungoid   oily brown skin something   clumsy deliberation   tedious movements unspeakably nasty even  this first encounter this first glimpse i  overcome  disgust  dread suddenly  monster vanished it had toppled over  brim   cylinder  fallen into  pit   thud like  fall   great mass  leather i heard  give  peculiar thick cry  forthwith another  these creatures appeared darkly   deep shadow   aperture i turned and running madly made   first group  trees perhaps  hundred yards away but i ran slantingly  stumbling  i could not avert my face  these things there among some young pine trees  furze bushes i stopped panting  waited further developments the common round  sandpits  dotted  people standing like myself   halffascinated terror staring  these creatures or rather   heaped gravel   edge   pit  which they lay and then   renewed horror i saw  round black object bobbing up  down   edge   pit it   head   shopman who had fallen in but showing   little black object against  hot western sun now  got his shoulder  knee up  again  seemed  slip back until only his head  visible suddenly  vanished  i could have fancied  faint shriek had reached me i had  momentary impulse  go back  help him  my fears overruled everything  then quite invisible hidden   deep pit   heap  sand   fall   cylinder had made anyone coming along  road  chobham or woking would have been amazed   sight—a dwindling multitude  perhaps  hundred people or more standing   great irregular circle  ditches behind bushes behind gates  hedges saying little  one another    short excited shouts  staring staring hard   few heaps  sand the barrow  ginger beer stood  queer derelict black against  burning sky    sandpits   row  deserted vehicles  their horses feeding out  nosebags or pawing  ground v the heatray after  glimpse i had had   martians emerging   cylinder  which they had come   earth  their planet  kind  fascination paralysed my actions i remained standing kneedeep   heather staring   mound  hid them i   battleground  fear  curiosity i did not dare  go back towards  pit but i felt  passionate longing  peer into it i began walking therefore   big curve seeking some point  vantage  continually looking   sandheaps  hid these newcomers  our earth once  leash  thin black whips like  arms   octopus flashed across  sunset   immediately withdrawn  afterwards  thin rod rose up joint  joint bearing   apex  circular disk  spun   wobbling motion what could  going  there most   spectators had gathered  one or two groups—one  little crowd towards woking  other  knot  people   direction  chobham evidently they shared my mental conflict there  few near me one man i approached—he was i perceived  neighbour  mine though i did not know his name—and accosted but   scarcely  time  articulate conversation “what ugly brutes”  said “good god what ugly brutes” he repeated this over  over again “did you see  man   pit” i said but  made no answer  that we became silent  stood watching   time side  side deriving i fancy  certain comfort  one another’s company then i shifted my position   little knoll  gave me  advantage   yard or more  elevation  when i looked  him presently   walking towards woking the sunset faded  twilight before anything further happened the crowd far away   left towards woking seemed  grow  i heard now  faint murmur  it the little knot  people towards chobham dispersed there  scarcely  intimation  movement   pit it  this  much  anything  gave people courage  i suppose  new arrivals  woking also helped  restore confidence at any rate   dusk came   slow intermittent movement upon  sandpits began  movement  seemed  gather force   stillness   evening about  cylinder remained unbroken vertical black figures  twos  threes would advance stop watch  advance again spreading out  they did so   thin irregular crescent  promised  enclose  pit   attenuated horns i too  my side began  move towards  pit then i saw some cabmen  others had walked boldly into  sandpits  heard  clatter  hoofs   gride  wheels i saw  lad trundling off  barrow  apples and then within thirty yards   pit advancing   direction  horsell i noted  little black knot  men  foremost  whom  waving  white flag this   deputation there had been  hasty consultation  since  martians  evidently  spite  their repulsive forms intelligent creatures  had been resolved  show them  approaching them  signals  we too  intelligent flutter flutter went  flag first   right then   left it  too far  me  recognise anyone there but afterwards i learned  ogilvy stent  henderson   others  this attempt  communication this little group had   advance dragged inward so  speak  circumference   now almost complete circle  people   number  dim black figures followed   discreet distances suddenly there   flash  light   quantity  luminous greenish smoke came out   pit  three distinct puffs which drove up one after  other straight into  still air this smoke or flame perhaps would   better word  it  so bright   deep blue sky overhead   hazy stretches  brown common towards chertsey set  black pine trees seemed  darken abruptly  these puffs arose   remain  darker after their dispersal at  same time  faint hissing sound became audible beyond  pit stood  little wedge  people   white flag   apex arrested  these phenomena  little knot  small vertical black shapes upon  black ground as  green smoke arose their faces flashed out pallid green  faded again   vanished then slowly  hissing passed into  humming into  long loud droning noise slowly  humped shape rose out   pit   ghost   beam  light seemed  flicker out  it forthwith flashes  actual flame  bright glare leaping  one  another sprang   scattered group  men it   if some invisible jet impinged upon them  flashed into white flame it   if each man  suddenly  momentarily turned  fire then   light  their own destruction i saw them staggering  falling  their supporters turning  run i stood staring not  yet realising  this  death leaping  man  man   little distant crowd all i felt     something very strange an almost noiseless  blinding flash  light   man fell headlong  lay still    unseen shaft  heat passed over them pine trees burst into fire  every dry furze bush became  one dull thud  mass  flames and far away towards knaphill i saw  flashes  trees  hedges  wooden buildings suddenly set alight it  sweeping round swiftly  steadily this flaming death this invisible inevitable sword  heat i perceived  coming towards me   flashing bushes  touched   too astounded  stupefied  stir i heard  crackle  fire   sandpits   sudden squeal   horse    suddenly stilled then    if  invisible yet intensely heated finger  drawn through  heather between me   martians  all along  curving line beyond  sandpits  dark ground smoked  crackled something fell   crash far away   left where  road  woking station opens out   common forthwith  hissing  humming ceased   black domelike object sank slowly out  sight into  pit all this had happened  such swiftness  i had stood motionless dumbfounded  dazzled   flashes  light had  death swept through  full circle  must inevitably have slain me  my surprise but  passed  spared me  left  night about me suddenly dark  unfamiliar the undulating common seemed now dark almost  blackness except where  roadways

me  without came—fear with  effort i turned  began  stumbling run through  heather the fear i felt  no rational fear but  panic terror not only   martians but   dusk  stillness all about me such  extraordinary effect  unmanning me  had  i ran weeping silently   child might do once i had turned i did not dare  look back i remember i felt  extraordinary persuasion  i  being played with

woking even knew   cylinder had opened though poor henderson had sent  messenger   bicycle   post office   special wire   evening paper as these folks came out  twos  threes upon  open they found

remember nothing  my flight except  stress  blundering against trees  stumbling through  heather all about me gathered  invisible terrors   martians  pitiless sword  heat seemed whirling   fro flourishing overhead before  descended  smote me out  life i came into  road between  crossroads  horsell  ran along this   crossroads at last i could go no further i  exhausted   violence  my emotion   my flight  i staggered  fell   wayside that  near  bridge  crosses  canal   gasworks i fell  lay still i must have remained there some time i sat up strangely perplexed for  moment perhaps i could not clearly understand how i came there my terror had fallen  me like  garment my hat had gone  my collar had burst away   fastener a few minutes before there had only been three real things before me—the immensity   night  space  nature my own feebleness  anguish   near approach  death now    if something turned over   point  view altered abruptly there  no sensible transition  one state  mind   other i  immediately  self  every day again—a decent ordinary citizen the silent common  impulse  my flight  starting flames   if they had been   dream i asked myself had these latter things indeed happened i could not credit it i rose  walked unsteadily up  steep incline   bridge my mind  blank wonder my muscles  nerves seemed drained  their strength i dare say i staggered drunkenly a head rose over  arch   figure   workman carrying  basket appeared beside him ran  little boy he passed me wishing me good night i  minded  speak  him but did not i answered his greeting   meaningless mumble  went  over  bridge over  maybury arch  train  billowing tumult  white firelit smoke   long caterpillar  lighted windows went flying south—clatter clatter clap rap   had gone a dim group  people talked   gate  one   houses   pretty little row  gables   called oriental terrace it  all so real  so familiar and  behind me it  frantic fantastic such things i told myself could not be perhaps i am  man  exceptional moods i do not know how far my experience  common at times i suffer   strangest sense  detachment  myself   world about me i seem  watch  all   outside  somewhere inconceivably remote out  time out  space out   stress  tragedy   all this feeling  very strong upon me  night here  another side  my dream but  trouble   blank incongruity  this serenity   swift death flying yonder not two miles away there   noise  business   gasworks   electric lamps  all alight i stopped   group  people “what news   common” said i there  two men   woman   gate “eh” said one   men turning “what news   common” i said “ain’t yer just been there” asked  men “people seem fair silly about  common” said  woman over  gate “what’s  all abart” “haven’t you heard   men  mars” said i “the creatures  mars” “quite enough” said  woman over  gate “thenks”  all three  them laughed i felt foolish  angry i tried  found i could not tell them what i had seen they laughed again  my broken sentences “you’ll hear more yet” i said  went   my home i startled my wife   doorway so haggard  i i went into  dining room sat down drank some wine  so soon  i could collect myself sufficiently i told her  things i had seen the dinner which   cold one had already been served  remained neglected   table while i told my story “there  one thing” i said  allay  fears i had aroused “they   most sluggish things i ever saw crawl they may keep  pit  kill people who come near them but they cannot get out  it    but  horror  them” “don’t dear” said my wife knitting her brows  putting her hand  mine “poor ogilvy” i said “to think  may  lying dead there” my wife  least did not find my experience incredible when i saw how deadly white her face was i ceased abruptly “they may come here” she said again  again i pressed her  take wine  tried  reassure her “they can scarcely move” i said i began  comfort her  myself  repeating all  ogilvy had told me   impossibility   martians establishing themselves   earth in particular i laid stress   gravitational difficulty on  surface   earth  force  gravity  three times what     surface  mars a martian therefore would weigh three times more than  mars albeit his muscular strength would   same his own body would   cope  lead  him therefore that indeed   general opinion both the times   daily telegraph  instance insisted    next morning  both overlooked just  i did two obvious modifying influences the atmosphere   earth we now know contains far more oxygen or far less argon whichever way one likes  put it than does mars’ the invigorating influences  this excess  oxygen upon  martians indisputably did much  counterbalance  increased weight  their bodies and   second place we all overlooked  fact  such mechanical intelligence   martian possessed  quite able  dispense  muscular exertion   pinch but i did not consider these points   time  so my reasoning  dead against  chances   invaders with wine  food  confidence  my own table   necessity  reassuring my wife i grew  insensible degrees courageous  secure “they have done  foolish thing” said i fingering my wineglass “they  dangerous because no doubt they  mad  terror perhaps they expected  find no living things—certainly no intelligent living things” “a shell   pit” said i “if  worst comes   worst  kill them all” the intense excitement   events had no doubt left my perceptive powers   state

even philosophical writers had many little luxuries—the crimsonpurple wine  my glass  photographically distinct at  end   i sat tempering nuts   cigarette regretting ogilvy’s rashness  denouncing  shortsighted timidity   martians so some respectable dodo   mauritius might have lorded   his nest  discussed  arrival   shipful  pitiless sailors  want  animal food “we  peck them  death tomorrow my

greenish colour  caused  silent brightness like summer lightning this   second cylinder ix the fighting begins saturday lives  my memory   day  suspense it   day  lassitude too hot  close with i am told  rapidly fluctuating barometer i had slept but little though my wife had succeeded  sleeping  i rose early i went into my garden before breakfast  stood listening but towards  common there  nothing stirring but  lark the milkman came  usual i heard  rattle  his chariot  i went round   side gate  ask  latest news he told me  during  night  martians had been surrounded  troops   guns  expected then—a familiar reassuring note—i heard  train running towards woking “they aren’t   killed” said  milkman “if  can possibly  avoided” i saw my neighbour gardening chatted  him   time  then strolled   breakfast it   most unexceptional morning my neighbour   opinion   troops would  able  capture or  destroy  martians during  day “it’s  pity they make themselves so unapproachable”  said “it would  curious  know how they live  another planet we might learn  thing or two” he came up   fence  extended  handful  strawberries  his gardening   generous    enthusiastic at  same time  told me   burning   pine woods about  byfleet golf links “they say” said he “that there’s another  those blessed things fallen there—number two but one’s enough surely this lot’ll cost  insurance people  pretty penny before everything’s settled” he laughed   air   greatest good humour   said this the woods  said  still burning  pointed out  haze  smoke  me “they   hot under foot  days  account   thick soil  pine needles  turf”  said  then grew serious over “poor ogilvy” after breakfast instead  working i decided  walk down towards  common under  railway bridge i found  group  soldiers—sappers i think men  small round caps dirty red jackets unbuttoned  showing their blue shirts dark trousers  boots coming   calf they told me no one  allowed over  canal and looking along  road towards  bridge i saw one   cardigan men standing sentinel there i talked  these soldiers   time i told them  my sight   martians   previous evening none  them had seen  martians  they had but  vaguest ideas  them so  they plied me  questions they said  they did not know who had authorised  movements   troops their idea    dispute had arisen   horse guards the ordinary sapper   great deal better educated than  common soldier  they discussed  peculiar conditions   possible fight  some acuteness i described  heatray  them  they began  argue among themselves “crawl up under cover  rush ’em say i” said one “get aht” said another “what’s cover against this ’ere ’eat sticks  cook yer what we got  do   go  near   ground’ll let us  then drive  trench” “blow yer trenches you always want trenches you ought  ha’ been born  rabbit snippy” “ain’t they got any necks then” said  third abruptly—a little contemplative dark man smoking  pipe i repeated my description “octopuses” said he “that’s what i calls ’em talk about fishers  men—fighters  fish   this time” “it ain’t no murder killing beasts like that” said  first speaker “why not shell  darned things strite off  finish ’em” said  little dark man “you carn tell what they might do” “where’s your shells” said  first speaker “there ain’t no time do    rush that’s my tip  do   once” so they discussed it after  while i left them  went    railway station  get  many morning papers  i could but i  not weary  reader   description   long morning    longer afternoon i did not succeed  getting  glimpse   common  even horsell  chobham church towers    hands   military authorities the soldiers i addressed didn’t know anything  officers  mysterious  well  busy i found people   town quite secure again   presence   military  i heard   first time  marshall  tobacconist  his son  among  dead   common the soldiers had made  people   outskirts  horsell lock up  leave their houses i got back  lunch about two very tired for  i have said  day  extremely hot  dull   order  refresh myself i took  cold bath   afternoon about half past four i went up   railway station  get  evening paper   morning papers had contained only  very inaccurate description   killing  stent henderson ogilvy   others but there  little i didn’t know the martians did not show  inch  themselves they seemed busy  their pit  there   sound  hammering   almost continuous streamer  smoke apparently they  busy getting ready   struggle “fresh attempts have been made  signal but without success”   stereotyped formula   papers a sapper told me   done   man   ditch   flag   long pole the martians took  much notice  such advances  we should   lowing   cow i must confess  sight  all this armament all this preparation greatly excited me my imagination became belligerent  defeated  invaders   dozen striking ways something  my schoolboy dreams  battle  heroism came back it hardly seemed  fair fight  me   time they seemed very helpless   pit  theirs about three o’clock there began  thud   gun  measured intervals  chertsey or addlestone i learned   smouldering pine wood into which  second cylinder had fallen  being shelled   hope  destroying  object before  opened it  only about five however   field gun reached chobham  use against  first body  martians about six   evening  i sat  tea  my wife   summerhouse talking vigorously about  battle   lowering upon us i heard  muffled detonation   common  immediately after  gust  firing close   heels   came  violent rattling crash quite close  us  shook  ground and starting out upon  lawn i saw  tops   trees about  oriental college burst into smoky red flame   tower   little church beside  slide down into ruin the pinnacle   mosque had vanished   roof line   college itself looked  if  hundredton gun had been  work upon it one  our chimneys cracked  if  shot had hit it flew   piece   came clattering down  tiles  made  heap  broken red fragments upon  flower bed  my study window i  my wife stood amazed then i realised   crest  maybury hill must  within range   martians’ heatray now   college  cleared out   way at  i gripped my wife’s arm  without ceremony ran her out into  road then i fetched out  servant telling her i would go upstairs myself   box she  clamouring for “we can’t possibly stay here” i said   i spoke  firing reopened   moment upon  common “but where  we  go” said my wife  terror i thought perplexed then i remembered her cousins  leatherhead “leatherhead” i shouted above  sudden noise she looked away  me downhill the people  coming out  their houses astonished “how  we  get  leatherhead” she said down  hill i saw  bevy  hussars ride under  railway bridge three galloped through  open gates   oriental college two others dismounted  began running  house  house the sun shining through  smoke  drove up   tops   trees seemed blood red  threw  unfamiliar lurid light upon everything “stop here” said i “you  safe here”  i started off  once   spotted dog  i knew  landlord had  horse  dog cart i ran  i perceived    moment everyone upon this side   hill would  moving i found him  his bar quite unaware  what  going  behind his house a man stood  his back  me talking  him “i must have  pound” said  landlord “and i’ve no one  drive it” “i’ll give you two” said i over  stranger’s shoulder “what for” “and i’ll bring  back  midnight” i said “lord” said  landlord “what’s  hurry i’m selling my bit   pig two pounds  you bring  back what’s going  now” i explained hastily  i had  leave my home  so secured  dog cart at  time  did not seem  me nearly so urgent   landlord should leave his i took care  have  cart there  then drove  off down  road and leaving   charge  my wife  servant rushed into my house  packed  few valuables such plate  we had  so forth the beech trees below  house  burning while i did this   palings up  road glowed red while i  occupied  this way one   dismounted hussars came running up he  going  house  house warning people  leave he  going   i came out  my front door lugging my treasures done up   tablecloth i shouted after him “what news” he turned stared bawled something about “crawling out   thing like  dish cover”  ran    gate   house   crest a sudden whirl  black smoke driving across  road hid him   moment i ran  my neighbour’s door  rapped  satisfy myself  what i already knew  his wife had gone  london  him  had locked up their house i went  again according  my promise  get my servant’s box lugged  out clapped  beside her   tail   dog cart  then caught  reins  jumped up into  driver’s seat beside my wife in another moment we  clear   smoke  noise  spanking down  opposite slope  maybury hill towards old woking in front   quiet sunny landscape  wheat field ahead  either side   road   maybury inn   swinging sign i saw  doctor’s cart ahead  me at  bottom   hill i turned my head  look   hillside i  leaving thick streamers  black smoke shot  threads  red fire  driving up into  still air  throwing dark shadows upon  green treetops eastward the smoke already extended far away   east  west—to  byfleet pine woods eastward   woking   west the road  dotted  people running towards us and very faint now but very distinct through  hot quiet air one heard  whirr   machinegun   presently stilled   intermittent cracking  rifles apparently  martians  setting fire  everything within range  their heatray i am not  expert driver  i had immediately  turn my attention   horse when i looked back again  second hill had hidden  black smoke i slashed  horse   whip  gave him  loose rein until woking  send lay between us   quivering tumult i overtook  passed  doctor between woking  send x in the storm leatherhead  about twelve miles  maybury hill the scent  hay    air through  lush meadows beyond pyrford   hedges  either side  sweet  gay  multitudes  dogroses the heavy firing  had broken out while we  driving down maybury hill ceased  abruptly   began leaving  evening very peaceful  still we got  leatherhead without misadventure about nine o’clock   horse had  hour’s rest while i took supper  my cousins  commended my wife  their care my wife  curiously silent throughout  drive  seemed oppressed  forebodings  evil i talked  her reassuringly pointing out   martians  tied   pit  sheer heaviness    utmost could but crawl  little out  it but she answered only  monosyllables had  not been  my promise   innkeeper she would i think have urged me  stay  leatherhead  night would  i had her face i remember  very white  we parted for my own part i had been feverishly excited all day something very like  war fever  occasionally runs through  civilised community had got into my blood   my heart i  not so very sorry  i had  return  maybury  night i  even afraid   last fusillade i had heard might mean  extermination  our invaders  mars i can best express my state  mind  saying  i wanted      death it  nearly eleven when i started  return the night  unexpectedly dark  me walking out   lighted passage  my cousins’ house  seemed indeed black     hot  close   day overhead  clouds  driving fast albeit not  breath stirred  shrubs about us my cousins’ man lit both lamps happily i knew  road intimately my wife stood   light   doorway  watched me until i jumped up into  dog cart then abruptly she turned  went in leaving my cousins side  side wishing me good hap i   little depressed  first   contagion  my wife’s fears but very soon my thoughts reverted   martians at  time i  absolutely   dark    course   evening’s fighting i did not know even  circumstances  had precipitated  conflict as i came through ockham for    way i returned  not through send  old woking i saw along  western horizon  bloodred glow which  i drew nearer crept slowly up  sky the driving clouds   gathering thunderstorm mingled there  masses  black  red smoke ripley street  deserted  except   lighted window or so  village showed not  sign  life but i narrowly escaped  accident   corner   road  pyrford where  knot  people stood  their backs  me they said nothing  me  i passed i do not know what they knew   things happening beyond  hill nor do i know if  silent houses i passed  my way  sleeping securely or deserted  empty or harassed  watching against  terror   night from ripley until i came through pyrford i    valley   wey   red glare  hidden  me as i ascended  little hill beyond pyrford church  glare came into view again   trees about me shivered   first intimation   storm   upon me then i heard midnight pealing out  pyrford church behind me  then came  silhouette  maybury hill   treetops  roofs black  sharp against  red even  i beheld this  lurid green glare lit  road about me  showed  distant woods towards addlestone i felt  tug   reins i saw   driving clouds had been pierced      thread  green fire suddenly lighting their confusion  falling into  field  my left it   third falling star close   apparition  blindingly violet  contrast danced out  first lightning   gathering storm   thunder burst like  rocket overhead the horse took  bit between his teeth  bolted a moderate incline runs towards  foot  maybury hill  down this we clattered once  lightning had begun  went    rapid  succession  flashes  i have ever seen the thunderclaps treading one   heels  another    strange crackling accompaniment sounded more like  working   gigantic electric machine than  usual detonating reverberations the flickering light  blinding  confusing   thin hail smote gustily  my face  i drove down  slope at first i regarded little but  road before me  then abruptly my attention  arrested  something   moving rapidly down  opposite slope  maybury hill at first i took    wet roof   house but one flash following another showed     swift rolling movement it   elusive vision—a moment  bewildering darkness  then   flash like daylight  red masses   orphanage near  crest   hill  green tops   pine trees  this problematical object came out clear  sharp  bright and this thing i saw how can i describe it a monstrous tripod higher than many houses striding over  young pine trees  smashing them aside   career  walking engine  glittering metal striding now across  heather articulate ropes  steel dangling  it   clattering tumult   passage mingling   riot   thunder a flash   came out vividly heeling over one way  two feet   air  vanish  reappear almost instantly   seemed   next flash  hundred yards nearer can you imagine  milking stool tilted  bowled violently along  ground that   impression those instant flashes gave but instead   milking stool imagine   great body  machinery   tripod stand then suddenly  trees   pine wood ahead  me  parted  brittle reeds  parted   man thrusting through them they  snapped off  driven headlong   second huge tripod appeared rushing   seemed headlong towards me and i  galloping hard  meet it at  sight   second monster my nerve went altogether not stopping  look again i wrenched  horse’s head hard round   right   another moment  dog cart had heeled over upon  horse  shafts smashed noisily  i  flung sideways  fell heavily into  shallow pool  water i crawled out almost immediately  crouched my feet still   water under  clump  furze the horse lay motionless his neck  broken poor brute    lightning flashes i saw  black bulk   overturned dog cart   silhouette   wheel still spinning slowly in another moment  colossal mechanism went striding  me  passed uphill towards pyrford seen nearer  thing  incredibly strange    no mere insensate machine driving   way machine  was   ringing metallic pace  long flexible glittering tentacles one  which gripped  young pine tree swinging  rattling about  strange body it picked  road   went striding along   brazen hood  surmounted  moved   fro   inevitable suggestion   head looking about behind  main body   huge mass  white metal like  gigantic fisherman’s basket  puffs  green smoke squirted out   joints   limbs   monster swept  me and   instant   gone so much i saw then all vaguely   flickering   lightning  blinding highlights  dense black shadows as  passed  set up  exultant deafening howl  drowned  thunder—“aloo aloo”—and  another minute     companion half  mile away stooping over something   field i have no doubt this thing   field   third   ten cylinders they had fired  us  mars for some minutes i lay there   rain  darkness watching   intermittent light these monstrous beings  metal moving about   distance over  hedge tops a thin hail  now beginning    came  went their figures grew misty  then flashed into clearness again now  then came  gap   lightning   night swallowed them up i  soaked  hail above  puddle water below it  some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up  bank   drier position or think  all  my imminent peril not far  me   little oneroomed squatter’s hut  wood surrounded   patch  potato garden i struggled  my feet  last and crouching  making use  every chance  cover i made  run  this i hammered   door but i could not make  people hear if there  any people inside  after  time i desisted and availing myself   ditch   greater part   way succeeded  crawling unobserved  these monstrous machines into  pine woods towards maybury under cover  this i pushed on wet  shivering now towards my own house i walked among  trees trying  find  footpath it  very dark indeed   wood   lightning  now becoming infrequent   hail which  pouring down   torrent fell  columns through  gaps   heavy foliage if i had fully realised  meaning  all  things i had seen i should have immediately worked my way round through byfleet  street cobham  so gone back  rejoin my wife  leatherhead but  night  strangeness  things about me  my physical wretchedness prevented me  i  bruised weary wet   skin deafened  blinded   storm i had  vague idea  going   my own house     much motive  i had i staggered through  trees fell into  ditch  bruised my knees against  plank  finally splashed out into  lane  ran down   college arms i say splashed   storm water  sweeping  sand down  hill   muddy torrent there   darkness  man blundered into me  sent me reeling back he gave  cry  terror sprang sideways  rushed  before i could gather my wits sufficiently  speak  him so heavy   stress   storm just  this place  i had  hardest task  win my way up  hill i went close up   fence   left  worked my way along  palings near  top i stumbled upon something soft and   flash  lightning saw between my feet  heap  black broadcloth   pair  boots before i could distinguish clearly how  man lay  flicker  light had passed i stood over him waiting   next flash when  came i saw     sturdy man cheaply but not shabbily dressed his head  bent under his body   lay crumpled up close   fence  though  had been flung violently against it overcoming  repugnance natural  one who had never before touched  dead body i stooped  turned him over  feel  his heart he  quite dead apparently his neck had been broken the lightning flashed   third time  his face leaped upon me i sprang  my feet it   landlord   spotted dog whose conveyance i had taken i stepped over him gingerly  pushed  up  hill i made my way   police station   college arms towards my own house nothing  burning   hillside though   common there still came  red glare   rolling tumult  ruddy smoke beating up against  drenching hail so far  i could see   flashes  houses about me  mostly uninjured by  college arms  dark heap lay   road down  road towards maybury bridge there  voices   sound  feet but i had not  courage  shout or  go  them i let myself   my latchkey closed locked  bolted  door staggered   foot   staircase  sat down my imagination  full  those striding metallic monsters    dead body smashed against  fence i crouched   foot   staircase  my back   wall shivering violently xi at the window i have already said  my storms  emotion have  trick  exhausting themselves after  time i discovered  i  cold  wet   little pools  water about me   stair carpet i got up almost mechanically went into  dining room  drank some whisky  then i  moved  change my clothes after i had done  i went upstairs  my study but why i did so i do not know the window  my study looks over  trees   railway towards horsell common in  hurry  our departure this window had been left open the passage  dark and  contrast   picture  window frame enclosed  side   room seemed impenetrably dark i stopped short   doorway the thunderstorm had passed the towers   oriental college   pine trees about  had gone  very far away lit   vivid red glare  common about  sandpits  visible across  light huge black shapes grotesque  strange moved busily   fro it seemed indeed  if  whole country   direction   fire—a broad hillside set  minute tongues  flame swaying  writhing   gusts   dying storm  throwing  red reflection upon  cloud scud above every now  then  haze  smoke  some nearer conflagration drove across  window  hid  martian shapes i could not see what they  doing nor  clear form  them nor recognise  black objects they  busied upon neither could i see  nearer fire though  reflections   danced   wall  ceiling   study a sharp resinous tang  burning    air i closed  door noiselessly  crept towards  window as i did so  view opened out until   one hand  reached   houses about woking station    other   charred  blackened pine woods  byfleet there   light down below  hill   railway near  arch  several   houses along  maybury road   streets near  station  glowing ruins the light upon  railway puzzled me  first there   black heap   vivid glare    right    row  yellow oblongs then i perceived this   wrecked train  fore part smashed   fire  hinder carriages still upon  rails between these three main centres  light—the houses  train   burning county towards chobham—stretched irregular patches  dark country broken here  there  intervals  dimly glowing  smoking ground it   strangest spectacle  black expanse set  fire it reminded me more than anything else   potteries  night at first i could distinguish no people  all though i peered intently  them later i saw against  light  woking station  number  black figures hurrying one after  other across  line and this   little world  which i had been living securely  years this fiery chaos what had happened   last seven hours i still did not know nor did i know though i  beginning  guess  relation between these mechanical colossi   sluggish lumps i had seen disgorged   cylinder with  queer feeling  impersonal interest i turned my desk chair   window sat down  stared   blackened country  particularly   three gigantic black things   going   fro   glare about  sandpits they seemed amazingly busy i began  ask myself what they could be were they intelligent mechanisms such  thing i felt  impossible or did  martian sit within each ruling directing using much   man’s brain sits  rules  his body i began  compare  things  human machines  ask myself   first time  my life how  ironclad or  steam engine would seem   intelligent lower animal the storm had left  sky clear  over  smoke   burning land  little fading pinpoint  mars  dropping into  west when  soldier came into my garden i heard  slight scraping   fence  rousing myself   lethargy  had fallen upon me i looked down  saw him dimly clambering over  palings at  sight  another human being my torpor passed  i leaned out   window eagerly “hist” said i   whisper he stopped astride   fence  doubt then  came over  across  lawn   corner   house he bent down  stepped softly “who’s there”  said also whispering standing under  window  peering up “where  you going” i asked “god knows” “are you trying  hide” “that’s it” “come into  house” i said i went down unfastened  door  let him in  locked  door again i could not see his face he  hatless  his coat  unbuttoned “my god”  said  i drew him in “what  happened” i asked “what hasn’t” in  obscurity i could see  made  gesture  despair “they wiped us out—simply wiped us out”  repeated again  again he followed me almost mechanically into  dining room “take some whisky” i said pouring out  stiff dose he drank it then abruptly  sat down before  table put his head  his arms  began  sob  weep like  little boy   perfect passion  emotion while i   curious forgetfulness  my own recent despair stood beside him wondering it   long time before  could steady his nerves  answer my questions  then  answered perplexingly  brokenly he   driver   artillery  had only come into action about seven at  time firing  going  across  common    said  first party  martians  crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under cover   metal shield later this shield staggered up  tripod legs  became  first   fightingmachines i had seen the gun  drove had been unlimbered near horsell  order  command  sandpits   arrival    had precipitated  action as  limber gunners went   rear his horse trod   rabbit hole  came down throwing him into  depression   ground at  same moment  gun exploded behind him  ammunition blew up there  fire all about him   found himself lying under  heap  charred dead men  dead horses “i lay still”  said “scared out  my wits   fore quarter   horse atop  me we’d been wiped out and  smell—good god like burnt meat i  hurt across  back   fall   horse  there i had  lie until i felt better just like parade  had been  minute before—then stumble bang swish” “wiped out”  said he had hid under  dead horse   long time peeping out furtively across  common the cardigan men had tried  rush  skirmishing order   pit simply   swept out  existence then  monster had risen   feet  had begun  walk leisurely   fro across  common among  few fugitives   headlike hood turning about exactly like  head   cowled human being a kind  arm carried  complicated metallic case about which green flashes scintillated  out   funnel  this there smoked  heatray in  few minutes there was so far   soldier could see not  living thing left upon  common  every bush  tree upon    not already  blackened skeleton  burning the hussars had been   road beyond  curvature   ground   saw nothing  them he heard  maxims rattle   time  then become still the giant saved woking station   cluster  houses until  last then   moment  heatray  brought  bear   town became  heap  fiery ruins then  thing shut off  heatray  turning  back upon  artilleryman began  waddle away towards  smouldering pine woods  sheltered  second cylinder as  did so  second glittering titan built itself up out   pit the second monster followed  first     artilleryman began  crawl very cautiously across  hot heather ash towards horsell he managed  get alive into  ditch   side   road  so escaped  woking there his story became ejaculatory the place  impassable it seems there   few people alive there frantic   most part  many burned  scalded he  turned aside   fire  hid among some almost scorching heaps  broken wall  one   martian giants returned he saw this one pursue  man catch him up  one   steely tentacles  knock his head against  trunk   pine tree at last after nightfall  artilleryman made  rush    got over  railway embankment since then  had been skulking along towards maybury   hope  getting out  danger londonward people  hiding  trenches  cellars  many   survivors had made off towards woking village  send he had been consumed  thirst until  found one   water mains near  railway arch smashed   water bubbling out like  spring upon  road that   story i got  him bit  bit he grew calmer telling me  trying  make me see  things  had seen he had eaten no food since midday  told me early  his narrative  i found some mutton  bread   pantry  brought  into  room we lit no lamp  fear  attracting  martians  ever  again our hands would touch upon bread or meat as  talked things about us came darkly out   darkness   trampled bushes  broken rose trees outside  window grew distinct it would seem   number  men or animals had rushed across  lawn i began  see his face blackened  haggard  no doubt mine  also when we had finished eating we went softly upstairs  my study  i looked again out   open window in one night  valley had become  valley  ashes the fires had dwindled now where flames had been there  now streamers  smoke but  countless ruins  shattered  gutted houses  blasted  blackened trees   night had hidden stood out now gaunt  terrible   pitiless light  dawn yet here  there some object had had  luck  escape—a white railway signal here  end   greenhouse there white  fresh amid  wreckage never before   history  warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate  so universal and shining   growing light   east three   metallic giants stood about  pit their cowls rotating  though they  surveying  desolation they had made it seemed  me   pit had been enlarged  ever  again puffs  vivid green vapour streamed up  out   towards  brightening dawn—streamed up whirled broke  vanished beyond   pillars  fire about chobham they became pillars  bloodshot smoke   first touch  day xii what i saw of the destruction of weybridge and shepperton as  dawn grew brighter we withdrew   window  which we had watched  martians  went very quietly downstairs the artilleryman agreed  me   house  no place  stay in he proposed  said  make his way londonward  thence rejoin his battery—no    horse artillery my plan   return  once  leatherhead  so greatly had  strength   martians impressed me  i had determined  take my wife  newhaven  go  her out   country forthwith for i already perceived clearly   country about london must inevitably   scene   disastrous struggle before such creatures  these could  destroyed between us  leatherhead however lay  third cylinder   guarding giants had i been alone i think i should have taken my chance  struck across country but  artilleryman dissuaded me “it’s no kindness   right sort  wife”  said “to make her  widow”    end i agreed  go  him under cover   woods northward  far  street cobham before i parted  him thence i would make  big detour  epsom  reach leatherhead i should have started  once but my companion had been  active service   knew better than that he made me ransack  house   flask which  filled  whisky  we lined every available pocket  packets  biscuits  slices  meat then we crept out   house  ran  quickly  we could down  illmade road  which i had come overnight the houses seemed deserted in  road lay  group  three charred bodies close together struck dead   heatray  here  there  things  people had dropped—a clock  slipper  silver spoon   like poor valuables at  corner turning up towards  post office  little cart filled  boxes  furniture  horseless heeled over   broken wheel a cash box had been hastily smashed open  thrown under  debris except  lodge   orphanage which  still  fire none   houses had suffered very greatly here the heatray had shaved  chimney tops  passed yet save ourselves there did not seem    living soul  maybury hill the majority   inhabitants had escaped i suppose  way   old woking road—the road i had taken when i drove  leatherhead—or they had hidden we went down  lane   body   man  black sodden now   overnight hail  broke into  woods   foot   hill we pushed through these towards  railway without meeting  soul the woods across  line  but  scarred  blackened ruins  woods   most part  trees had fallen but  certain proportion still stood dismal grey stems  dark brown foliage instead  green on our side  fire had done no more than scorch  nearer trees  had failed  secure  footing in one place  woodmen had been  work  saturday trees felled  freshly trimmed lay   clearing  heaps  sawdust   sawingmachine   engine hard    temporary hut deserted there  not  breath  wind this morning  everything  strangely still even  birds  hushed   we hurried along i   artilleryman talked  whispers  looked now  again over our shoulders once or twice we stopped  listen after  time we drew near  road   we did so we heard  clatter  hoofs  saw through  tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowly towards woking we hailed them  they halted while we hurried towards them it   lieutenant   couple  privates   th hussars   stand like  theodolite which  artilleryman told me   heliograph “you   first men i’ve seen coming this way this morning” said  lieutenant “what’s brewing” his voice  face  eager the men behind him stared curiously the artilleryman jumped down  bank into  road  saluted “gun destroyed last night sir have been hiding trying  rejoin battery sir you’ll come  sight   martians i expect about half  mile along this road” “what  dickens  they like” asked  lieutenant “giants  armour sir hundred feet high three legs   body like ’luminium   mighty great head   hood sir” “get out” said  lieutenant “what confounded nonsense” “you’ll see sir they carry  kind  box sir  shoots fire  strikes you dead” “what d’ye mean—a gun” “no sir”   artilleryman began  vivid account   heatray halfway through  lieutenant interrupted him  looked up  me i  still standing   bank   side   road “it’s perfectly true” i said “well” said  lieutenant “i suppose it’s my business  see  too look here”—to  artilleryman—“we’re detailed here clearing people out  their houses you’d better go along  report yourself  brigadiergeneral marvin  tell him all you know he’s  weybridge know  way” “i do” i said   turned his horse southward again “half  mile you say” said he “at most” i answered  pointed over  treetops southward he thanked me  rode on  we saw them no more farther along we came upon  group  three women  two children   road busy clearing out  labourer’s cottage they had got hold   little hand truck   piling  up  uncleanlooking bundles  shabby furniture they  all too assiduously engaged  talk  us  we passed by byfleet station we emerged   pine trees  found  country calm  peaceful under  morning sunlight we  far beyond  range   heatray there  had  not been   silent desertion  some   houses  stirring movement  packing  others   knot  soldiers standing   bridge over  railway  staring down  line towards woking  day would have seemed very like any other sunday several farm waggons  carts  moving creakily along  road  addlestone  suddenly through  gate   field we saw across  stretch  flat meadow six twelvepounders standing neatly  equal distances pointing towards woking the gunners stood   guns waiting   ammunition waggons    businesslike distance the men stood almost  if under inspection “that’s good” said i “they  get one fair shot  any rate” the artilleryman hesitated   gate “i shall go on”  said farther  towards weybridge just over  bridge there   number  men  white fatigue jackets throwing up  long rampart  more guns behind “it’s bows  arrows against  lightning anyhow” said  artilleryman “they ’aven’t seen  firebeam yet” the officers who  not actively engaged stood  stared over  treetops southwestward   men digging would stop every now  again  stare   same direction byfleet    tumult people packing   score  hussars some  them dismounted some  horseback  hunting them about three or four black government waggons  crosses  white circles   old omnibus among other vehicles  being loaded   village street there  scores  people most  them sufficiently sabbatical  have assumed their best clothes the soldiers  having  greatest difficulty  making them realise  gravity  their position we saw one shrivelled old fellow   huge box   score or more  flower pots containing orchids angrily expostulating   corporal who would leave them behind i stopped  gripped his arm “do you know what’s over there” i said pointing   pine tops  hid  martians “eh” said he turning “i  explainin’ these  vallyble” “death” i shouted “death  coming death”  leaving him  digest  if  could i hurried  after  artilleryman at  corner i looked back the soldier had left him    still standing  his box   pots  orchids   lid  it  staring vaguely over  trees no one  weybridge could tell us where  headquarters  established  whole place   such confusion  i had never seen  any town before carts carriages everywhere  most astonishing miscellany  conveyances  horseflesh the respectable inhabitants   place men  golf  boating costumes wives prettily dressed  packing riverside loafers energetically helping children excited and   most part highly delighted  this astonishing variation  their sunday experiences in  midst   all  worthy vicar  very pluckily holding  early celebration  his bell  jangling out above  excitement i   artilleryman seated   step   drinking fountain made  very passable meal upon what we had brought  us patrols  soldiers—here no longer hussars but grenadiers  white—were warning people  move now or  take refuge  their cellars  soon   firing began we saw  we crossed  railway bridge   growing crowd  people had assembled   about  railway station   swarming platform  piled  boxes  packages the ordinary traffic had been stopped i believe  order  allow   passage  troops  guns  chertsey  i have heard since   savage struggle occurred  places   special trains   put    later hour we remained  weybridge until midday    hour we found ourselves   place near shepperton lock where  wey  thames join part   time we spent helping two old women  pack  little cart the wey   treble mouth   this point boats    hired  there   ferry across  river on  shepperton side   inn   lawn  beyond   tower  shepperton church—it  been replaced   spire—rose above  trees here we found  excited  noisy crowd  fugitives as yet  flight had not grown   panic but there  already far more people than all  boats going   fro could enable  cross people came panting along under heavy burdens one husband  wife  even carrying  small outhouse door between them  some  their household goods piled thereon one man told us  meant  try  get away  shepperton station there   lot  shouting  one man  even jesting the idea people seemed  have here    martians  simply formidable human beings who might attack  sack  town   certainly destroyed   end every now  then people would glance nervously across  wey   meadows towards chertsey but everything over there  still across  thames except just where  boats landed everything  quiet  vivid contrast   surrey side the people who landed there   boats went tramping off down  lane the big ferryboat had just made  journey three or four soldiers stood   lawn   inn staring  jesting   fugitives without offering  help the inn  closed    now within prohibited hours “what’s that” cried  boatman  “shut up you fool” said  man near me   yelping dog then  sound came again this time   direction  chertsey  muffled thud—the sound   gun the fighting  beginning almost immediately unseen batteries across  river  our right unseen because   trees took up  chorus firing heavily one after  other a woman screamed everyone stood arrested   sudden stir  battle near us  yet invisible  us nothing    seen save flat meadows cows feeding unconcernedly   most part  silvery pollard willows motionless   warm sunlight “the sojers’ll stop ’em” said  woman beside me doubtfully a haziness rose over  treetops then suddenly we saw  rush  smoke far away up  river  puff  smoke  jerked up into  air  hung  forthwith  ground heaved under foot   heavy explosion shook  air smashing two or three windows   houses near  leaving us astonished “here they are” shouted  man   blue jersey “yonder d’yer see them yonder” quickly one after  other one two three four   armoured martians appeared far away over  little trees across  flat meadows  stretched towards chertsey  striding hurriedly towards  river little cowled figures they seemed  first going   rolling motion   fast  flying birds then advancing obliquely towards us came  fifth their armoured bodies glittered   sun  they swept swiftly forward upon  guns growing rapidly larger  they drew nearer one   extreme left  remotest  is flourished  huge case high   air   ghostly terrible heatray i had already seen  friday night smote towards chertsey  struck  town at sight  these strange swift  terrible creatures  crowd near  water’s edge seemed  me     moment horrorstruck there  no screaming or shouting but  silence then  hoarse murmur   movement  feet—a splashing   water a man too frightened  drop  portmanteau  carried  his shoulder swung round  sent me staggering   blow   corner  his burden a woman thrust  me  her hand  rushed past me i turned   rush   people but i  not too terrified  thought the terrible heatray   my mind to get under water that  it “get under water” i shouted unheeded i faced about again  rushed towards  approaching martian rushed right down  gravelly beach  headlong into  water others did  same a boatload  people putting back came leaping out  i rushed past the stones under my feet  muddy  slippery   river  so low  i ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waistdeep then   martian towered overhead scarcely  couple  hundred yards away i flung myself forward under  surface the splashes   people   boats leaping into  river sounded like thunderclaps  my ears people  landing hastily  both sides   river but  martian machine took no more notice   moment   people running this way   than  man would   confusion  ants   nest against which his foot  kicked when half suffocated i raised my head above water  martian’s hood pointed   batteries   still firing across  river    advanced  swung loose what must have been  generator   heatray in another moment     bank    stride wading halfway across the knees   foremost legs bent   farther bank   another moment  had raised itself   full height again close   village  shepperton forthwith  six guns which unknown  anyone   right bank had been hidden behind  outskirts   village fired simultaneously the sudden near concussion  last close upon  first made my heart jump the monster  already raising  case generating  heatray   first shell burst six yards above  hood i gave  cry  astonishment i saw  thought nothing   other four martian monsters my attention  riveted upon  nearer incident simultaneously two other shells burst   air near  body   hood twisted round  time  receive but not  time  dodge  fourth shell the shell burst clean   face   thing the hood bulged flashed  whirled off   dozen tattered fragments  red flesh  glittering metal “hit” shouted i  something between  scream   cheer i heard answering shouts   people   water about me i could have leaped out   water   momentary exultation the decapitated colossus reeled like  drunken giant but  did not fall over it recovered  balance   miracle and no longer heeding  steps    camera  fired  heatray now rigidly upheld  reeled swiftly upon shepperton the living intelligence  martian within  hood  slain  splashed   four winds  heaven   thing  now but  mere intricate device  metal whirling  destruction it drove along   straight line incapable  guidance it struck  tower  shepperton church smashing  down   impact   battering ram might have done swerved aside blundered   collapsed  tremendous force into  river out  my sight a violent explosion shook  air   spout  water steam mud  shattered metal shot far up into  sky as  camera   heatray hit  water  latter had immediately flashed into steam in another moment  huge wave like  muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly hot came sweeping round  bend upstream i saw people struggling shorewards  heard their screaming  shouting faintly above  seething  roar   martian’s collapse for  moment i heeded nothing   heat forgot  patent need  selfpreservation i splashed through  tumultuous water pushing aside  man  black  do so until i could see round  bend half  dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon  confusion   waves the fallen martian came into sight downstream lying across  river    most part submerged thick clouds  steam  pouring off  wreckage  through  tumultuously whirling wisps i could see intermittently  vaguely  gigantic limbs churning  water  flinging  splash  spray  mud  froth into  air the tentacles swayed  struck like living arms and save   helpless purposelessness  these movements    if some wounded thing  struggling   life amid  waves enormous quantities   ruddybrown fluid  spurting up  noisy jets out   machine my attention  diverted  this death flurry   furious yelling like    thing called  siren  our manufacturing towns a man kneedeep near  towing path shouted inaudibly  me  pointed looking back i saw  other martians advancing  gigantic strides down  riverbank   direction  chertsey the shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly at  i ducked  once under water and holding my breath until movement   agony blundered painfully ahead under  surface  long  i could the water    tumult about me  rapidly growing hotter when   moment i raised my head  take breath  throw  hair  water  my eyes  steam  rising   whirling white fog   first hid  martians altogether the noise  deafening then i saw them dimly colossal figures  grey magnified   mist they had passed  me  two  stooping over  frothing tumultuous ruins  their comrade the third  fourth stood beside him   water one perhaps two hundred yards  me  other towards laleham the generators   heatrays waved high   hissing beams smote down this way  that the air  full  sound  deafening  confusing conflict  noises—the clangorous din   martians  crash  falling houses  thud  trees fences sheds flashing into flame   crackling  roaring  fire dense black smoke  leaping up  mingle   steam   river    heatray went   fro over weybridge  impact  marked  flashes  incandescent white  gave place  once   smoky dance  lurid flames the nearer houses still stood intact awaiting their fate shadowy faint  pallid   steam   fire behind them going   fro for  moment perhaps i stood there breasthigh   almost boiling water dumbfounded  my position hopeless  escape through  reek i could see  people who had been  me   river scrambling out   water through  reeds like little frogs hurrying through grass   advance   man or running   fro  utter dismay   towing path then suddenly  white flashes   heatray came leaping towards me the houses caved   they dissolved   touch  darted out flames  trees changed  fire   roar the ray flickered up  down  towing path licking off  people who ran this way  that  came down   water’s edge not fifty yards  where i stood it swept across  river  shepperton   water   track rose   boiling weal crested  steam i turned shoreward in another moment  huge wave wellnigh   boilingpoint had rushed upon me i screamed aloud  scalded half blinded agonised i staggered through  leaping hissing water towards  shore had my foot stumbled  would have been  end i fell helplessly  full sight   martians upon  broad bare gravelly spit  runs down  mark  angle   wey  thames i expected nothing but death i have  dim memory   foot   martian coming down within  score  yards  my head driving straight into  loose gravel whirling  this way    lifting again   long suspense  then   four carrying  debris  their comrade between them now clear  then presently faint through  veil  smoke receding interminably   seemed  me across  vast space  river  meadow and then very slowly i realised    miracle i had escaped xiii how i fell in with the curate after getting this sudden lesson   power  terrestrial weapons  martians retreated  their original position upon horsell common   their haste  encumbered   debris  their smashed companion they no doubt overlooked many such  stray  negligible victim  myself had they left their comrade  pushed  forthwith there  nothing   time between them  london but batteries  twelvepounder guns  they would certainly have reached  capital  advance   tidings  their approach

before twilight every copse every row  suburban villas   hilly slopes about kingston  richmond masked  expectant black muzzle and through  charred  desolated area—perhaps twenty square miles

 thus preparing  their next sally   front  me humanity gathered   battle i made my way  infinite pains  labour   fire  smoke  burning weybridge towards london i saw  abandoned boat very small  remote drifting downstream  throwing off  most  my sodden clothes i went after it gained it  so escaped out   destruction there  no oars   boat but i contrived  paddle  well  my parboiled hands would allow down  river towards halliford  walton going very tediously  continually looking behind me  you may well understand i followed  river because i considered   water gave me my best chance  escape should these giants return the hot water   martian’s overthrow drifted downstream  me so    best part   mile i could see little  either bank once however i made out  string  black figures hurrying across

long grass i suppose  time  then about four or five o’clock i got up presently walked perhaps half  mile without meeting  soul  then lay down again   shadow   hedge i seem  remember talking wanderingly  myself during  last spurt i  also very thirsty  bitterly regretful i had drunk no more water it   curious thing  i felt angry  my wife i cannot account  it but my impotent desire  reach leatherhead worried me excessively i do not clearly remember  arrival   curate so  probably i dozed i became aware  him   seated figure  sootsmudged shirt sleeves   his upturned cleanshaven face staring   faint flickering  danced over  sky the sky  what  called  mackerel sky—rows  rows  faint downplumes  cloud just tinted   midsummer sunset i sat up    rustle  my motion  looked  me quickly “have you any water” i asked abruptly he shook his head “you have been asking  water   last hour”  said for  moment we  silent taking stock  each other i dare say  found me  strange enough figure naked save  my watersoaked trousers  socks scalded  my face  shoulders blackened   smoke his face   fair weakness his chin retreated  his hair lay  crisp almost flaxen curls  his low forehead his eyes  rather large pale blue  blankly staring he spoke abruptly looking vacantly away  me “what does  mean”  said “what do these things mean” i stared  him  made no answer he extended  thin white hand  spoke  almost  complaining tone “why  these things permitted what sins have we done the morning service  over i  walking through  roads  clear my brain   afternoon  then—fire earthquake death as if   sodom  gomorrah all our work undone all  work—— what  these martians” “what  we” i answered clearing my throat he gripped his knees  turned  look  me again for half  minute perhaps  stared silently “i  walking through  roads  clear my brain”  said “and suddenly—fire earthquake death” he relapsed into silence  his chin now sunken almost  his knees presently  began waving his hand “all  work—all  sunday schools—what have we done—what  weybridge done everything gone—everything destroyed the church we rebuilt  only three years ago gone swept out  existence why” another pause   broke out again like one demented “the smoke  her burning goeth up  ever  ever”  shouted his eyes flamed   pointed  lean finger   direction  weybridge by this time i  beginning  take his measure the tremendous tragedy  which  had been involved—it  evident    fugitive  weybridge—had driven him   very verge  his reason “are we far  sunbury” i said   matteroffact tone “what  we  do”  asked “are these creatures everywhere has  earth been given over  them” “are we far  sunbury” “only this morning i officiated  early celebration——” “things have changed” i said quietly “you must keep your head there  still hope” “hope” “yes plentiful hope—for all this destruction” i began  explain my view  our position he listened  first but  i went   interest dawning  his eyes gave place  their former stare  his regard wandered  me “this must   beginning   end”  said interrupting me “the end the great  terrible day   lord when men shall call upon  mountains   rocks  fall upon them  hide them—hide them   face  him  sitteth upon  throne” i began  understand  position i ceased my laboured reasoning struggled  my feet and standing over him laid my hand  his shoulder “be  man” said i “you  scared out  your wits what good  religion if  collapses under calamity think  what earthquakes  floods wars  volcanoes have done before  men did you think god had exempted weybridge he  not  insurance agent” for  time  sat  blank silence “but how can we escape”  asked suddenly “they  invulnerable they  pitiless” “neither  one nor perhaps  other” i answered “and  mightier they   more sane  wary should we be one  them  killed yonder not three hours ago” “killed”  said staring about him “how can god’s ministers  killed” “i saw  happen” i proceeded  tell him “we have chanced  come    thick  it” said i “and   all” “what   flicker   sky”  asked abruptly i told him    heliograph signalling—that    sign  human help  effort   sky “we    midst  it” i said “quiet   is that flicker   sky tells   gathering storm yonder i take    martians  londonward where those hills rise about richmond  kingston   trees give cover earthworks  being thrown up  guns  being placed presently  martians   coming this way again” and even  i spoke  sprang  his feet  stopped me   gesture “listen”  said from beyond  low hills across  water came  dull resonance  distant guns   remote weird crying then everything  still a cockchafer came droning over  hedge  past us high   west  crescent moon hung faint  pale above  smoke  weybridge  shepperton   hot still splendour   sunset “we had better follow this path” i said “northward” xiv in london my younger brother   london when  martians fell  woking he   medical student working   imminent examination   heard nothing   arrival until saturday morning the morning papers  saturday

night drew on until  last  roads my brother said  like epsom high street   derby day my brother addressed several  these fugitives  got unsatisfactory answers  most none  them could tell him any news

craned their heads out   window straining  hear what  policemen  shouting people  coming out   side streets  standing  groups   corners talking “what  devil   all about” said my brother’s fellow

happening my brother went down  out into  street just   sky between  parapets   houses grew pink   early dawn the flying people  foot   vehicles grew more numerous every moment “black smoke”  heard people crying  again “black smoke” the contagion  such  unanimous fear  inevitable as my brother hesitated   doorstep  saw another newsvendor approaching  got  paper forthwith the man  running away   rest  selling his papers   shilling each   ran—a grotesque mingling  profit  panic and  this paper my brother read  catastrophic dispatch   commanderinchief “the martians  able  discharge enormous

him his landlady came   door loosely wrapped  dressing gown  shawl her husband followed ejaculating as my brother began  realise  import  all these things  turned hastily  his own room put all his available money—some ten pounds altogether—into his pockets  went out again into  streets xv what had happened in surrey it  while  curate had sat  talked so wildly  me under  hedge   flat meadows near halliford  while my brother  watching  fugitives stream over westminster bridge   martians had resumed  offensive so far  one can ascertain   conflicting accounts  have been put forth  majority  them remained busied  preparations   horsell pit until nine  night hurrying  some operation  disengaged huge volumes  green smoke but three certainly came out about eight o’clock and advancing slowly  cautiously made their way through byfleet  pyrford towards ripley  weybridge  so came  sight   expectant batteries against  setting sun these martians did not advance   body but   line each perhaps  mile   half  his nearest fellow they communicated  one another  means  sirenlike howls running up  down  scale  one note  another it  this howling  firing   guns  ripley  st george’s hill  we had heard  upper halliford the ripley gunners unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never  have been placed  such  position fired one wild premature ineffectual volley  bolted  horse  foot through  deserted village while  martian without using his heatray walked serenely over their guns stepped gingerly among them passed  front  them  so came unexpectedly upon  guns  painshill park which  destroyed the st george’s hill men however  better led or   better mettle hidden   pine wood  they were they seem  have been quite unsuspected   martian nearest  them they laid their guns  deliberately  if they had been  parade  fired  about  thousand yards’ range the shells flashed all round him    seen  advance  few paces stagger  go down everybody yelled together   guns  reloaded  frantic haste the overthrown martian set up  prolonged ululation  immediately  second glittering giant answering him appeared over  trees   south it would seem   leg   tripod had been smashed  one   shells the whole   second volley flew wide   martian   ground and simultaneously both his companions brought their heatrays  bear   battery the ammunition blew up  pine trees all about  guns flashed into fire  only one or two   men who  already running over  crest   hill escaped after this  would seem   three took counsel together  halted   scouts who  watching them report  they remained absolutely stationary   next half hour the martian who had been overthrown crawled tediously out  his hood  small brown figure oddly suggestive   distance   speck  blight  apparently engaged   repair  his support about nine  had finished  his cowl  then seen above  trees again it   few minutes past nine  night when these three sentinels  joined  four other martians each carrying  thick black tube a similar tube  handed  each   three   seven proceeded  distribute themselves  equal distances along  curved line between st george’s hill weybridge   village  send southwest  ripley a dozen rockets sprang out   hills before them so soon  they began  move  warned  waiting batteries about ditton  esher at  same time four  their fighting machines similarly armed  tubes crossed  river  two  them black against  western sky came into sight  myself   curate  we hurried wearily  painfully along  road  runs northward out  halliford they moved   seemed  us upon  cloud   milky mist covered  fields  rose   third  their height at this sight  curate cried faintly  his throat  began running but i knew   no good running   martian  i turned aside  crawled through dewy nettles  brambles into  broad ditch   side   road he looked back saw what i  doing  turned  join me the two halted  nearer  us standing  facing sunbury  remoter being  grey indistinctness towards  evening star away towards staines the occasional howling   martians had ceased they took up their positions   huge crescent about their cylinders  absolute silence it   crescent  twelve miles between  horns never since  devising  gunpowder   beginning   battle so still to us    observer about ripley  would have had precisely  same effect—the martians seemed  solitary possession   darkling night lit only      slender moon  stars  afterglow   daylight   ruddy glare  st george’s hill   woods  painshill but facing  crescent everywhere—at staines hounslow ditton esher ockham behind hills  woods south   river  across  flat grass meadows   north  it wherever  cluster  trees or village houses gave sufficient cover—the guns  waiting the signal rockets burst  rained their sparks through  night  vanished   spirit  all those watching batteries rose   tense expectation the martians had but  advance into  line  fire  instantly those motionless black forms  men those guns glittering so darkly   early night would explode into  thunderous fury  battle no doubt  thought   uppermost   thousand  those vigilant minds even    uppermost  mine   riddle—how much they understood  us did they grasp  we  our millions  organized disciplined working together or did they interpret our spurts  fire  sudden stinging  our shells our steady investment  their encampment  we should  furious unanimity  onslaught   disturbed hive  bees did they dream they might exterminate us at  time no one knew what food they needed a hundred such questions struggled together  my mind  i watched  vast sentinel shape and   back  my mind   sense

houses then after  interminable time   seemed  us crouching  peering through  hedge came  sound like  distant concussion   gun another nearer  then another and then  martian beside us raised his tube  high  discharged it gunwise   heavy report  made  ground heave the one towards staines answered him there  no flash no smoke simply  loaded detonation i  so excited  these heavy minuteguns following one another  i so far forgot my personal safety  my scalded hands   clamber up into  hedge  stare towards sunbury as i did so  second report followed   big projectile hurtled overhead towards hounslow i expected  least  see smoke or fire or some such evidence   work but all i saw   deep blue sky above  one solitary star   white mist spreading wide  low beneath and there had been no crash no answering explosion the silence  restored  minute lengthened  three “what  happened” said  curate standing up beside me “heaven knows” said i a bat flickered   vanished a distant tumult  shouting began  ceased i looked again   martian  saw   now moving eastward along  riverbank   swift rolling motion every moment i expected  fire  some hidden battery  spring upon him but  evening calm  unbroken the figure   martian grew smaller   receded  presently  mist   gathering night had swallowed him up by  common impulse we clambered higher towards sunbury   dark appearance  though  conical hill had suddenly come into being there hiding our view   farther country  then remoter across  river over walton we saw another such summit these hilllike forms grew lower  broader even  we stared moved   sudden thought i looked northward  there i perceived  third  these cloudy black kopjes had risen everything had suddenly become very still far away   southeast marking  quiet we heard  martians hooting  one another  then  air quivered again   distant thud  their guns but  earthly artillery made no reply now   time we could not understand these things but later i   learn  meaning  these ominous kopjes  gathered   twilight each   martians standing   great crescent i have described had discharged  means   gunlike tube  carried  huge canister over whatever hill copse cluster

western sky something flat  broad  very large  swept round   vast curve grew smaller sank slowly  vanished again into  grey mystery   night and   flew  rained down darkness upon  land book two the earth under the martians i under foot in  first book i have wandered so much  my own adventures  tell   experiences  my brother  all through  last two chapters i   curate have been lurking   empty house  halliford whither we fled  escape  black smoke there i  resume we stopped there all sunday night  all  next day—the day   panic—in  little island  daylight cut off   black smoke   rest   world we could do nothing but wait  aching inactivity during those two weary days my mind  occupied  anxiety  my wife i figured her  leatherhead terrified  danger mourning me already   dead man i paced  rooms  cried aloud when i thought  how i  cut off  her  all  might happen  her  my absence my cousin i knew  brave enough  any emergency but   not  sort  man  realise danger quickly  rise promptly what  needed now  not bravery but circumspection my only consolation   believe   martians  moving londonward  away  her such vague anxieties keep  mind sensitive  painful i grew very weary  irritable   curate’s perpetual ejaculations i tired   sight  his selfish despair after some ineffectual remonstrance i kept away  him staying   room—evidently  children’s schoolroom—containing globes forms  copybooks when  followed me thither i went   box room   top   house and  order   alone  my aching miseries locked myself in we  hopelessly hemmed    black smoke all  day   morning   next there  signs  people   next house  sunday evening—a face   window  moving lights  later  slamming   door but i do not know who these people were nor what became  them we saw nothing  them next day the black smoke drifted slowly riverward all through monday morning creeping nearer  nearer  us driving  last along  roadway outside  house  hid us a martian came across  fields about midday laying  stuff   jet  superheated steam  hissed against  walls smashed all  windows  touched  scalded  curate’s hand   fled out   front room when  last we crept across  sodden rooms  looked out again  country northward   though  black snowstorm had passed over it looking towards  river we  astonished  see  unaccountable redness mingling   black   scorched meadows for  time we did not see how this change affected our position save  we  relieved  our fear   black smoke but later i perceived  we  no longer hemmed in  now we might get away so soon  i realised   way  escape  open my dream  action returned but  curate  lethargic unreasonable “we  safe here”  repeated “safe here” i resolved  leave him—would  i had wiser now   artilleryman’s teaching i sought out food  drink i had found oil  rags  my burns  i also took  hat   flannel shirt  i found  one   bedrooms when   clear  him  i meant  go alone—had reconciled myself  going alone—he suddenly roused himself  come and all being quiet throughout  afternoon we started about five o’clock  i should judge along  blackened road  sunbury in sunbury   intervals along  road  dead bodies lying  contorted attitudes horses  well  men overturned carts  luggage all covered thickly  black dust that pall  cindery powder made me think  what i had read   destruction  pompeii we got  hampton court without misadventure our minds full  strange  unfamiliar appearances   hampton court our eyes  relieved  find  patch  green  had escaped  suffocating drift we went through bushey park   deer going   fro under  chestnuts  some men  women hurrying   distance towards hampton  so we came  twickenham these   first people we saw away across  road  woods beyond ham  petersham  still afire twickenham  uninjured  either heatray or black smoke  there  more people about here though none could give us news for  most part they  like ourselves taking advantage   lull  shift their quarters i have  impression  many   houses here  still occupied  scared inhabitants too frightened even  flight here too  evidence   hasty rout  abundant along  road i remember most vividly three smashed bicycles   heap pounded into  road   wheels  subsequent carts we crossed richmond bridge about half past eight we hurried across  exposed bridge  course but i noticed floating down  stream  number  red masses some many feet across i did not know what these were—there  no time  scrutiny—and i put  more horrible interpretation  them than they deserved here again   surrey side  black dust  had once been smoke  dead bodies—a heap near  approach   station but we had no glimpse   martians until we  some way towards barnes we saw   blackened distance  group  three people running down  side street towards  river but otherwise  seemed deserted up  hill richmond town  burning briskly outside  town  richmond there  no trace   black smoke then suddenly  we approached kew came  number  people running   upperworks   martian fightingmachine loomed  sight over  housetops not  hundred yards away  us we stood aghast  our danger  had  martian looked down we must immediately have perished we  so terrified  we dared not go on but turned aside  hid   shed   garden there  curate crouched weeping silently  refusing  stir again but my fixed idea  reaching leatherhead would not let me rest    twilight i ventured out again i went through  shrubbery  along  passage beside  big house standing   own grounds  so emerged upon  road towards kew the curate i left   shed but  came hurrying after me that second start   most foolhardy thing i ever did for   manifest  martians  about us no sooner had  curate overtaken me than we saw either  fightingmachine we had seen before or another far away across  meadows   direction  kew lodge four or five little black figures hurried before  across  greengrey   field    moment   evident this martian pursued them in three strides   among them  they ran radiating  his feet  all directions he used no heatray  destroy them but picked them up one  one apparently  tossed them into  great metallic carrier which projected behind him much   workman’s basket hangs over his shoulder it   first time i realised   martians might have any other purpose than destruction  defeated humanity we stood   moment petrified then turned  fled through  gate behind us into  walled garden fell into rather than found  fortunate ditch  lay there scarce daring  whisper  each other until  stars  out i suppose   nearly eleven o’clock before we gathered courage  start again no longer venturing into  road but sneaking along hedgerows  through plantations  watching keenly through  darkness    right  i   left   martians who seemed   all about us in one place we blundered upon  scorched  blackened area now cooling  ashen   number  scattered dead bodies  men burned horribly about  heads  trunks but  their legs  boots mostly intact   dead horses fifty feet perhaps behind  line  four ripped guns  smashed gun carriages sheen  seemed had escaped destruction but  place  silent  deserted here we happened  no dead though  night  too dark  us  see into  side roads   place in sheen my companion suddenly complained  faintness  thirst  we decided  try one   houses the first house we entered after  little difficulty   window   small semidetached villa  i found nothing eatable left   place but some mouldy cheese there was however water  drink  i took  hatchet which promised   useful  our next housebreaking we then crossed   place where  road turns towards mortlake here there stood  white house within  walled garden    pantry  this domicile we found  store  food—two loaves  bread   pan  uncooked steak   half   ham i give this catalogue so precisely because   happened we  destined  subsist upon this store   next fortnight bottled beer stood under  shelf  there  two bags  haricot beans  some limp lettuces this pantry opened into  kind  washup kitchen   this  firewood there  also  cupboard  which we found nearly  dozen  burgundy tinned soups  salmon  two tins  biscuits we sat   adjacent kitchen   dark—for we dared not strike  light—and ate bread  ham  drank beer out   same bottle the curate who  still timorous  restless  now oddly enough  pushing on  i  urging him  keep up his strength  eating when  thing happened    imprison us “it can’t  midnight yet” i said  then came  blinding glare  vivid green light everything   kitchen leaped out clearly visible  green  black  vanished again and then followed such  concussion  i have never heard before or since so close   heels  this   seem instantaneous came  thud behind me  clash  glass  crash  rattle  falling masonry all about us   plaster   ceiling came down upon us smashing into  multitude  fragments upon our heads i  knocked headlong across  floor against  oven handle  stunned i  insensible   long time  curate told me  when i came  we   darkness again  he   face wet  i found afterwards  blood   cut forehead  dabbing water over me for some time i could not recollect what had happened then things came  me slowly a bruise  my temple asserted itself “are you better” asked  curate   whisper at last i answered him i sat up “don’t move”  said “the floor  covered  smashed crockery   dresser you can’t possibly move without making  noise  i fancy they  outside” we both sat quite silent so  we could scarcely hear each other breathing everything seemed deadly still but once something near us some plaster or broken brickwork slid down   rumbling sound outside  very near   intermittent metallic rattle “that” said  curate when presently  happened again “yes” i said “but what  it” “a martian” said  curate i listened again “it  not like  heatray” i said    time i  inclined  think one   great fightingmachines had stumbled against  house  i had seen one stumble against  tower  shepperton church our situation  so strange  incomprehensible   three or four hours until  dawn came we scarcely moved and then  light filtered in not through  window which remained black but through  triangular aperture between  beam   heap  broken bricks   wall behind us the interior   kitchen we now saw greyly   first time the window had been burst    mass  garden mould which flowed over  table upon which we had been sitting  lay about our feet outside  soil  banked high against  house at  top   window frame we could see  uprooted drainpipe the floor  littered  smashed hardware  end   kitchen towards  house  broken into  since  daylight shone  there   evident  greater part   house had collapsed contrasting vividly  this ruin   neat dresser stained   fashion pale green    number  copper  tin vessels below it  wallpaper imitating blue  white tiles   couple  coloured supplements fluttering   walls above  kitchen range as  dawn grew clearer we saw through  gap   wall  body   martian standing sentinel i suppose over  still glowing cylinder at  sight   we crawled  circumspectly  possible out   twilight   kitchen into  darkness   scullery abruptly  right interpretation dawned upon my mind “the fifth cylinder” i whispered “the fifth shot  mars  struck this house  buried us under  ruins” for  time  curate  silent  then  whispered “god have mercy upon us” i heard him presently whimpering  himself save   sound we lay quite still   scullery i  my part scarce dared breathe  sat  my eyes fixed   faint light   kitchen door i could just see  curate’s face  dim oval shape  his collar  cuffs outside there began  metallic hammering then  violent hooting  then again after  quiet interval  hissing like  hissing   engine these noises   most part problematical continued intermittently  seemed if anything  increase  number  time wore on presently  measured thudding   vibration  made everything about us quiver   vessels   pantry ring  shift began  continued once  light  eclipsed   ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark for many hours we must have crouched there silent  shivering until our tired attention failed    at last i found myself awake  very hungry i am inclined  believe we must have spent  greater portion   day before  awakening my hunger    stride so insistent   moved me  action i told  curate i  going  seek food  felt my way towards  pantry he made me no answer but so soon  i began eating  faint noise i made stirred him up  i heard him crawling after me ii what we saw from the ruined house after eating we crept back   scullery  there i must have dozed again  when presently i looked round i  alone the thudding vibration continued  wearisome persistence i whispered   curate several times   last felt my way   door   kitchen it  still daylight  i perceived him across  room lying against  triangular hole  looked out upon  martians his shoulders  hunched so  his head  hidden  me i could hear  number  noises almost like those   engine shed   place rocked   beating thud through  aperture   wall i could see  top   tree touched  gold   warm blue   tranquil evening sky for  minute or so i remained watching  curate  then i advanced crouching  stepping  extreme care amid  broken crockery  littered  floor i touched  curate’s leg   started so violently   mass  plaster went sliding down outside  fell   loud impact i gripped his arm fearing  might cry out    long time we crouched motionless then i turned  see how much  our rampart remained the detachment   plaster had left  vertical slit open   debris   raising myself cautiously across  beam i  able  see out  this gap into what had been overnight  quiet suburban roadway vast indeed   change  we beheld the fifth cylinder must have fallen right into  midst   house we had first visited the building had vanished completely smashed pulverised  dispersed   blow the cylinder lay now far beneath  original foundations—deep   hole already vastly larger than  pit i had looked into  woking the earth all round  had splashed under  tremendous impact—“splashed”   only word—and lay  heaped piles  hid  masses   adjacent houses it had behaved exactly like mud under  violent blow   hammer our house had collapsed backward  front portion even   ground floor had been destroyed completely   chance  kitchen  scullery had escaped  stood buried now under soil  ruins closed   tons  earth  every side save towards  cylinder over  aspect we hung now   very edge   great circular pit  martians  engaged  making the heavy beating sound  evidently just behind us  ever  again  bright green vapour drove up like  veil across our peephole the cylinder  already opened   centre   pit    farther edge   pit amid  smashed  gravelheaped shrubbery one   great fightingmachines deserted   occupant stood stiff  tall against  evening sky at first i scarcely noticed  pit   cylinder although   been convenient  describe them first  account   extraordinary glittering mechanism i saw busy   excavation   account   strange creatures   crawling slowly  painfully across  heaped mould near it the mechanism  certainly   held my attention first it  one  those complicated fabrics  have since been called handlingmachines   study  which  already given such  enormous impetus  terrestrial invention as  dawned upon me first  presented  sort  metallic spider

bars which lined  covering  apparently strengthened  walls   cylinder these   extracted them  lifted out  deposited upon  level surface  earth behind it its motion  so swift complex  perfect   first i did not see    machine  spite   metallic glitter the fightingmachines  coordinated  animated   extraordinary pitch but nothing  compare  this people who have never seen these structures  have only  illimagined efforts  artists or  imperfect descriptions  such eyewitnesses  myself  go upon scarcely realise  living quality i recall particularly  illustration  one   first pamphlets  give  consecutive account   war the artist had evidently made  hasty study  one   fightingmachines  there his knowledge ended he presented them  tilted stiff tripods without either flexibility or subtlety    altogether misleading monotony  effect the pamphlet containing these renderings had  considerable vogue  i mention them here simply  warn  reader against  impression they may have created they  no more like  martians i saw  action than  dutch doll  like  human being to my mind  pamphlet would have been much better without them at first i say  handlingmachine did not impress me   machine but   crablike creature   glittering integument  controlling martian whose delicate tentacles actuated  movements seeming   simply  equivalent   crab’s cerebral portion but then i perceived  resemblance   greybrown shiny leathery integument     other sprawling bodies beyond   true nature  this dexterous workman dawned upon me with  realisation my interest shifted  those other creatures  real martians already i had had  transient impression  these   first nausea no longer obscured my observation moreover i  concealed  motionless  under no urgency  action they were i now saw  most unearthly creatures   possible  conceive they  huge round bodies—or rather heads—about four feet  diameter each body having  front    face this face had no nostrils—indeed  martians do not seem  have had any sense  smell but  had  pair  very large darkcoloured eyes  just beneath this  kind  fleshy beak in  back  this head or body—i scarcely know how  speak  it—was  single tight tympanic surface since known   anatomically  ear though  must have been almost useless  our dense air in  group round  mouth  sixteen slender almost whiplike tentacles arranged  two bunches  eight each these bunches have since been named rather aptly   distinguished anatomist professor howes  hands even  i saw these martians   first time they seemed   endeavouring  raise themselves  these hands but  course   increased weight  terrestrial conditions this  impossible there  reason  suppose   mars they may have progressed upon them  some facility the internal anatomy i may remark here  dissection  since shown  almost equally simple the greater part   structure   brain sending enormous nerves   eyes ear  tactile tentacles besides this   bulky lungs into which  mouth opened   heart   vessels the pulmonary distress caused   denser atmosphere  greater gravitational attraction  only too evident   convulsive movements   outer skin and this   sum   martian organs strange   may seem   human being all  complex apparatus  digestion which makes up  bulk  our bodies did not exist   martians they  heads—merely heads entrails they had none they did not eat much less digest instead they took  fresh living blood  other creatures  injected  into their own veins i have myself seen this being done  i shall mention   place but squeamish  i may seem i cannot bring myself  describe what i could not endure even  continue watching let  suffice  say blood obtained   still living animal  most cases   human being  run directly  means   little pipette into  recipient canal    the bare idea  this  no doubt horribly repulsive  us but   same time i think  we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem   intelligent rabbit the physiological advantages   practice  injection  undeniable if one thinks   tremendous waste  human time  energy occasioned  eating   digestive process our bodies  half made up  glands  tubes  organs occupied  turning heterogeneous food into blood the digestive processes  their reaction upon  nervous system sap our strength  colour our minds men go happy or miserable  they have healthy or unhealthy livers or sound gastric glands but  martians  lifted above all these organic fluctuations  mood  emotion their undeniable preference  men  their source  nourishment  partly explained   nature   remains   victims they had brought  them  provisions  mars these creatures  judge   shrivelled remains  have fallen into human hands  bipeds  flimsy silicious skeletons almost like those   silicious sponges  feeble musculature standing about six feet high  having round erect heads  large eyes  flinty sockets two or three  these seem  have been brought  each cylinder  all  killed before earth  reached it  just  well  them   mere attempt  stand upright upon our planet would have broken every bone  their bodies and while i am engaged  this description i may add  this place certain further details which although they  not all evident  us   time  enable  reader who  unacquainted  them  form  clearer picture  these offensive creatures in three other points their physiology differed strangely  ours their organisms did not sleep any more than  heart  man sleeps since they had no extensive muscular mechanism  recuperate  periodical extinction  unknown  them they had little or no sense  fatigue  would seem on earth they could never have moved without effort yet even   last they kept  action in twentyfour hours they did twentyfour hours  work  even  earth  perhaps  case   ants in  next place wonderful   seems   sexual world  martians  absolutely without sex  therefore without any   tumultuous emotions  arise   difference among men a young martian there can now  no dispute  really born upon earth during  war    found attached   parent partially budded off just  young lilybulbs bud off or like  young animals   freshwater polyp in man  all  higher terrestrial animals such  method  increase  disappeared but even  this earth   certainly  primitive method among  lower animals up even  those first cousins   vertebrated animals  tunicates  two processes occur side  side but finally  sexual method superseded  competitor altogether on mars however just  reverse  apparently been  case it  worthy  remark   certain speculative writer  quasiscientific repute writing long before  martian invasion did forecast  man  final structure not unlike  actual martian condition his prophecy i remember appeared  november or december    longdefunct publication  pall mall budget  i recall  caricature     premartian periodical called punch he pointed out—writing   foolish facetious tone—that  perfection  mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs  perfection  chemical devices digestion  such organs  hair external nose teeth ears  chin

dispute  actual accomplishment  such  suppression   animal side   organism   intelligence to me   quite credible   martians may  descended  beings not unlike ourselves   gradual development  brain  hands the latter giving rise   two bunches  delicate tentacles  last   expense   rest   body without  body  brain would  course become  mere selfish intelligence without any   emotional substratum   human being the last salient point  which  systems  these creatures differed  ours   what one might have thought  very trivial particular microorganisms which cause so much disease  pain  earth have either never appeared upon mars or martian sanitary science eliminated them ages ago a hundred diseases all  fevers  contagions  human life consumption cancers tumours  such morbidities never enter  scheme  their life and speaking   differences between  life  mars  terrestrial life i may allude here   curious suggestions   red weed apparently  vegetable kingdom  mars instead  having green   dominant colour    vivid bloodred tint at any rate  seeds which  martians intentionally or accidentally brought  them gave rise  all cases  redcoloured growths only  known popularly   red weed however gained any footing  competition  terrestrial forms the red creeper  quite  transitory growth  few people have seen  growing for  time however  red weed grew  astonishing vigour  luxuriance it spread up  sides   pit   third or fourth day  our imprisonment   cactuslike branches formed  carmine fringe   edges  our triangular window and afterwards i found  broadcast throughout  country  especially wherever there   stream  water the martians had what appears  have been  auditory organ  single round drum   back   headbody  eyes   visual range not very different  ours except that according  philips blue  violet   black  them it  commonly supposed  they communicated  sounds  tentacular gesticulations this  asserted  instance   able but hastily compiled pamphlet written evidently  someone not  eyewitness  martian actions  which i have already alluded  which so far  been  chief source  information concerning them now no surviving human being saw so much   martians  action  i did i take no credit  myself   accident but  fact  so and i assert  i watched them closely time after time   i have seen four five  once six  them sluggishly performing  most elaborately complicated operations together without either sound or gesture their peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding  had no modulation  was i believe  no sense  signal but merely  expiration  air preparatory   suctional operation i have  certain claim   least  elementary knowledge  psychology   this matter i am convinced—as firmly  i am convinced  anything—that  martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation and i have been convinced  this  spite  strong preconceptions before  martian invasion   occasional reader here or there may remember i had written  some little vehemence against  telepathic theory the martians wore no clothing their conceptions  ornament  decorum  necessarily different  ours  not only  they evidently much less sensible  changes  temperature than we are but changes  pressure do not seem  have affected their health  all seriously yet though they wore no clothing     other artificial additions  their bodily resources  their great superiority over man lay we men  our bicycles  roadskates our lilienthal soaringmachines our guns  sticks  so forth  just   beginning   evolution   martians have worked out they have become practically mere brains wearing different bodies according  their needs just  men wear suits  clothes  take  bicycle   hurry or  umbrella   wet and  their appliances perhaps nothing  more wonderful   man than  curious fact  what   dominant feature  almost all human devices  mechanism  absent—the wheel  absent among all  things they brought  earth there  no trace or suggestion  their use  wheels one would have  least expected   locomotion and  this connection   curious  remark  even  this earth nature  never hit upon  wheel or  preferred other expedients   development and not only did  martians either not know  which  incredible or abstain from  wheel but  their apparatus singularly little use  made   fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot  circular motions thereabout confined  one plane almost all  joints   machinery present  complicated system  sliding parts moving over small but beautifully curved friction bearings and while upon this matter  detail   remarkable   long leverages  their machines   most

seemed infinitely more alive than  actual martians lying beyond    sunset light panting stirring ineffectual tentacles  moving feebly after their vast journey across space while i  still watching their sluggish motions   sunlight  noting each strange detail  their form  curate reminded me  his presence  pulling violently  my arm i turned   scowling face  silent eloquent lips he wanted  slit

could see  thing  without  directing martian  all iii the days of imprisonment the arrival   second fightingmachine drove us  our peephole into  scullery  we feared   his elevation  martian might see

down  my story may lack nothing those who have escaped  dark  terrible aspects  life  find my brutality my flash  rage  our final tragedy easy enough  blame  they know what  wrong  well  any but not what  possible  tortured men but those who have been under  shadow who have gone down  last  elemental things  have  wider charity and while within we fought out our dark dim contest  whispers snatched food  drink  gripping hands  blows without   pitiless sunlight   terrible june   strange wonder  unfamiliar routine   martians   pit let me return  those first new experiences  mine after  long time i ventured back   peephole  find   newcomers had been reinforced   occupants  no fewer than three   fightingmachines these last had brought  them certain fresh appliances  stood   orderly manner about  cylinder the second handlingmachine  now completed   busied  serving one   novel contrivances  big machine had brought this   body resembling  milk can   general form above which oscillated  pearshaped receptacle   which  stream  white powder flowed into  circular basin below the oscillatory motion  imparted  this  one tentacle   handlingmachine with two spatulate hands  handlingmachine  digging out  flinging masses  clay into  pearshaped receptacle above while  another arm  periodically opened  door  removed rusty  blackened clinkers   middle part   machine another steely tentacle directed  powder   basin along  ribbed channel towards some receiver   hidden  me   mound  bluish dust from this unseen receiver  little thread  green smoke rose vertically into  quiet air as i looked  handlingmachine   faint  musical clinking extended telescopic fashion  tentacle  had been  moment before  mere blunt projection until  end  hidden behind  mound  clay in another second  had lifted  bar  white aluminium into sight untarnished  yet  shining dazzlingly  deposited    growing stack  bars  stood   side   pit between sunset  starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than  hundred such bars out   crude clay   mound  bluish dust rose steadily until  topped  side   pit the contrast between  swift  complex movements  these contrivances   inert panting clumsiness  their masters  acute   days i had  tell myself repeatedly  these latter  indeed  living   two things the curate had possession   slit when  first men  brought   pit i  sitting below huddled up listening  all my ears he made  sudden movement backward  i fearful  we  observed crouched   spasm  terror he came sliding down  rubbish  crept beside me   darkness inarticulate gesticulating    moment i shared his panic his gesture suggested  resignation   slit  after  little while my curiosity gave me courage  i rose up stepped across him  clambered up  it at first i could see no reason  his frantic behaviour the twilight had now come  stars  little  faint but  pit  illuminated   flickering green fire  came   aluminiummaking the whole picture   flickering scheme  green gleams  shifting rusty black shadows strangely trying   eyes over  through  all went  bats heeding  not  all the sprawling martians  no longer   seen  mound  bluegreen powder had risen  cover them  sight   fightingmachine   legs contracted crumpled  abbreviated stood across  corner   pit and then amid  clangour   machinery came  drifting suspicion  human voices  i entertained  first only  dismiss i crouched watching this fightingmachine closely satisfying myself now   first time   hood did indeed contain  martian as  green flames lifted i could see  oily gleam  his integument   brightness  his eyes and suddenly i heard  yell  saw  long tentacle reaching over  shoulder   machine   little cage  hunched upon  back then something—something struggling violently—was lifted high against  sky  black vague enigma against  starlight   this black object came down again i saw   green brightness     man for  instant   clearly visible he   stout ruddy middleaged man well dressed three days before  must have been walking  world  man  considerable consequence i could see his staring eyes  gleams  light  his studs  watch chain he vanished behind  mound    moment there  silence and then began  shrieking   sustained  cheerful hooting   martians i slid down  rubbish struggled  my feet clapped my hands over my ears  bolted into  scullery the curate who had been crouching silently  his arms over his head looked up  i passed cried out quite loudly  my desertion  him  came running after me that night  we lurked   scullery balanced between our horror   terrible fascination this peeping had although i felt  urgent need  action i tried  vain  conceive some plan  escape but afterwards during  second day i  able  consider our position  great clearness the curate i found  quite incapable  discussion this new  culminating atrocity had robbed him  all vestiges  reason or forethought practically  had already sunk   level   animal but   saying goes i gripped myself  both hands it grew upon my mind once i could face  facts  terrible  our position was there   yet no justification  absolute despair our chief chance lay   possibility   martians making  pit nothing more than  temporary encampment or even if they kept  permanently they might not consider  necessary  guard it   chance  escape might  afforded us i also weighed very carefully  possibility  our digging  way out   direction away   pit but  chances  our emerging within sight  some sentinel fightingmachine seemed  first too great and i should have had  do all  digging myself the curate would certainly have failed me it    third day if my memory serves me right  i saw  lad killed it   only occasion  which i actually saw  martians feed after  experience i avoided  hole   wall   better part   day i went into  scullery removed  door  spent some hours digging  my hatchet  silently  possible but when i had made  hole about  couple  feet deep  loose earth collapsed noisily  i did not dare continue i lost heart  lay down   scullery floor   long time having no spirit even  move and after  i abandoned altogether  idea  escaping  excavation it says much   impression  martians had made upon me   first i entertained little or no hope  our escape being brought about  their overthrow through any human effort but   fourth or fifth night i heard  sound like heavy guns it  very late   night   moon  shining brightly the martians had taken away  excavatingmachine and save   fightingmachine  stood   remoter bank   pit   handlingmachine   buried out  my sight   corner   pit immediately beneath my peephole  place  deserted  them except   pale glow   handlingmachine   bars  patches  white moonlight  pit   darkness and except   clinking   handlingmachine quite still that night   beautiful serenity save  one planet  moon seemed  have  sky  herself i heard  dog howling   familiar sound    made me listen then i heard quite distinctly  booming exactly like  sound  great guns six distinct reports i counted  after  long interval six again and   all iv the death of the curate it    sixth day  our imprisonment  i peeped   last time  presently found myself alone instead  keeping close  me  trying  oust me   slit  curate had gone back into  scullery i  struck   sudden thought i went back quickly  quietly into  scullery in  darkness i heard  curate drinking i snatched   darkness  my fingers caught  bottle  burgundy for  few minutes there   tussle the bottle struck  floor  broke  i desisted  rose we stood panting  threatening each other in  end i planted myself between him   food  told him  my determination  begin  discipline i divided  food   pantry into rations  last us ten days i would not let him eat any more  day in  afternoon  made  feeble effort  get   food i had been dozing but   instant i  awake all day  all night we sat face  face i weary but resolute   weeping  complaining  his immediate hunger it was i know  night   day but  me  seemed—it seems now—an interminable length  time and so our widened incompatibility ended  last  open conflict for two vast days we struggled  undertones  wrestling contests there  times when i beat  kicked him madly times when i cajoled  persuaded him  once i tried  bribe him   last bottle  burgundy  there   rainwater pump  which i could get water but neither force nor kindness availed   indeed beyond reason he would neither desist  his attacks   food nor  his noisy babbling  himself the rudimentary precautions  keep our imprisonment endurable  would not observe slowly i began  realise  complete overthrow  his intelligence  perceive  my sole companion  this close  sickly darkness   man insane from certain vague memories i am inclined  think my own mind wandered  times i had strange  hideous dreams whenever i slept it sounds paradoxical but i am inclined  think   weakness  insanity   curate warned me braced me  kept me  sane man on  eighth day  began  talk aloud instead  whispering  nothing i could do would moderate his speech “it  just o god”  would say over  over again “it  just on me  mine   punishment laid we have sinned we have fallen short there  poverty sorrow  poor  trodden   dust  i held my peace i preached acceptable folly—my god what folly—when i should have stood up though i died  it  called upon them  repent—repent    oppressors   poor  needy     the wine press  god” then  would suddenly revert   matter   food i withheld  him praying begging weeping  last threatening he began  raise his voice—i prayed him not to he perceived  hold  me—he threatened  would shout  bring  martians upon us for  time  scared me but any concession would have shortened our chance  escape beyond estimating i defied him although i felt no assurance   might not do this thing but  day  any rate  did not he talked  his voice rising slowly through  greater part   eighth  ninth days—threats entreaties mingled   torrent  halfsane  always frothy repentance  his vacant sham  god’s service such  made me pity him then  slept awhile  began again  renewed strength so loudly  i must needs make him desist “be still” i implored he rose  his knees   had been sitting   darkness near  copper “i have been still too long”  said   tone  must have reached  pit “and now i must bear my witness woe unto this unfaithful city woe woe woe woe woe to  inhabitants   earth  reason   other voices   trumpet——” “shut up” i said rising  my feet    terror lest  martians should hear us “for god’s sake——” “nay” shouted  curate   top  his voice standing likewise  extending his arms “speak the word   lord  upon me” in three strides     door leading into  kitchen “i must bear my witness i go it  already been too long delayed” i put out my hand  felt  meat chopper hanging   wall in  flash i  after him i  fierce  fear before   halfway across  kitchen i had overtaken him with one last touch  humanity i turned  blade back  struck him   butt he went headlong forward  lay stretched   ground i stumbled over him  stood panting he lay still suddenly i heard  noise without  run  smash  slipping plaster   triangular aperture   wall  darkened i looked up  saw  lower surface   handlingmachine coming slowly across  hole one   gripping limbs curled amid  debris another limb appeared feeling  way over  fallen beams i stood petrified staring then i saw through  sort  glass plate near  edge   body  face  we may call it   large dark eyes   martian peering  then  long metallic snake  tentacle came feeling slowly through  hole i turned   effort stumbled over  curate  stopped   scullery door the tentacle  now some way two yards or more   room  twisting  turning  queer sudden movements this way  that for  while i stood fascinated   slow fitful advance then   faint hoarse cry i forced myself across  scullery i trembled violently i could scarcely stand upright i opened  door   coal cellar  stood there   darkness staring   faintly lit doorway into  kitchen  listening had  martian seen me what   doing now something  moving   fro there very quietly every now  then  tapped against  wall or started   movements   faint metallic ringing like  movements  keys   splitring then  heavy body—i knew too well what—was dragged across  floor   kitchen towards  opening irresistibly attracted i crept   door  peeped into  kitchen in  triangle  bright outer sunlight i saw  martian   briareus   handlingmachine scrutinizing  curate’s head i thought  once   would infer my presence   mark   blow i had given him i crept back   coal cellar shut  door  began  cover myself up  much  i could   noiselessly  possible   darkness among  firewood  coal therein every now  then i paused rigid  hear if  martian had thrust  tentacles through  opening again then  faint metallic jingle returned i traced  slowly feeling over  kitchen presently i heard  nearer—in  scullery  i judged i thought   length might  insufficient  reach me i prayed copiously it passed scraping faintly across  cellar door an age  almost intolerable suspense intervened then i heard  fumbling   latch it had found  door the martians understood doors it worried   catch   minute perhaps  then  door opened in  darkness i could just see  thing—like  elephant’s trunk more than anything else—waving towards me  touching  examining  wall coals wood  ceiling it  like  black worm swaying  blind head   fro once even  touched  heel  my boot i    verge  screaming i bit my hand for  time  tentacle  silent i could have fancied  had been withdrawn presently   abrupt click  gripped something—i thought  had me—and seemed  go out   cellar again for  minute i  not sure apparently  had taken  lump  coal  examine i seized  opportunity  slightly shifting my position which had become cramped  then listened i whispered passionate prayers  safety then i heard  slow deliberate sound creeping towards me again slowly slowly  drew near scratching against  walls  tapping  furniture while i  still doubtful  rapped smartly against  cellar door  closed it i heard  go into  pantry   biscuittins rattled   bottle smashed  then came  heavy bump against  cellar door then silence  passed into  infinity  suspense had  gone at last i decided   had it came into  scullery no more but i lay all  tenth day   close darkness buried among coals  firewood not daring even  crawl out   drink  which i craved it   eleventh day before i ventured so far  my security v the stillness my first act before i went into  pantry   fasten  door between  kitchen   scullery but  pantry  empty every scrap  food had gone apparently  martian had taken  all   previous day at  discovery i despaired   first time i took no food or no drink either   eleventh or  twelfth day at first my mouth  throat  parched  my strength ebbed sensibly i sat about   darkness   scullery   state  despondent wretchedness my mind ran  eating i thought i had become deaf   noises  movement i had been accustomed  hear   pit had ceased absolutely i did not feel strong enough  crawl noiselessly   peephole or i would have gone there on  twelfth day my throat  so painful that taking  chance  alarming  martians i attacked  creaking rainwater pump  stood   sink  got  couple  glassfuls  blackened  tainted rain water i  greatly refreshed  this  emboldened   fact  no enquiring tentacle followed  noise  my pumping during these days   rambling inconclusive way i thought much   curate    manner  his death on  thirteenth day i drank some more water  dozed  thought disjointedly  eating   vague impossible plans  escape whenever i dozed i dreamt  horrible phantasms   death   curate or  sumptuous dinners but asleep or awake i felt  keen pain  urged me  drink again  again the light  came into  scullery  no longer grey but red to my disordered imagination  seemed  colour  blood on  fourteenth day i went into  kitchen  i  surprised  find   fronds   red weed had grown right across  hole   wall turning  halflight   place into  crimsoncoloured obscurity it  early   fifteenth day  i heard  curious familiar sequence  sounds   kitchen and listening identified    snuffing  scratching   dog going into  kitchen i saw  dog’s nose peering  through  break among  ruddy fronds this greatly surprised me at  scent  me  barked shortly i thought if i could induce him  come into  place quietly i should  able perhaps  kill  eat him   any case  would  advisable  kill him lest his actions attracted  attention   martians i crept forward saying “good dog” very softly but  suddenly withdrew his head  disappeared i listened—i  not deaf—but certainly  pit  still i heard  sound like  flutter   bird’s wings   hoarse croaking but   all for  long while i lay close   peephole but not daring  move aside  red plants  obscured it once or twice i heard  faint pitterpatter like  feet   dog going hither  thither   sand far below me  there  more birdlike sounds but   all at length encouraged   silence i looked out except   corner where  multitude  crows hopped  fought over  skeletons   dead  martians had consumed there  not  living thing   pit i stared about me scarcely believing my eyes all  machinery had gone save   big mound  greyishblue powder  one corner certain bars  aluminium  another  black birds   skeletons   killed  place  merely  empty circular pit   sand slowly i thrust myself out through  red weed  stood upon  mound  rubble i could see  any direction save behind me   north  neither martians nor sign  martians    seen the pit dropped sheerly  my feet but  little way along  rubbish afforded  practicable slope   summit   ruins my chance  escape had come i began  tremble i hesitated  some time  then   gust  desperate resolution    heart  throbbed violently i scrambled   top   mound  which i had been buried so long i looked about again to  northward too no martian  visible when i had last seen this part  sheen   daylight  had been  straggling street  comfortable white  red houses interspersed  abundant shady trees now i stood   mound  smashed brickwork clay  gravel over which spread  multitude  red cactusshaped plants kneehigh without  solitary terrestrial growth  dispute their footing the trees near me  dead  brown but further  network  red thread scaled  still living stems the neighbouring houses had all been wrecked but none had been burned their walls stood sometimes   second story  smashed windows  shattered doors the red weed grew tumultuously  their roofless rooms below me   great pit   crows struggling   refuse a number  other birds hopped about among  ruins far away i saw  gaunt cat slink crouchingly along  wall but traces  men there  none the day seemed  contrast  my recent confinement dazzlingly bright  sky  glowing blue a gentle breeze kept  red weed  covered every scrap  unoccupied ground gently swaying and oh  sweetness   air vi the work of fifteen days for some time i stood tottering   mound regardless  my safety within  noisome den  which i had emerged i had thought   narrow intensity only  our immediate security i had not realised what had been happening   world had not anticipated this startling vision  unfamiliar things i had expected  see sheen  ruins—i found about me  landscape weird  lurid  another planet for  moment i touched  emotion beyond  common range  men yet one   poor brutes we dominate know only too well i felt   rabbit might feel returning  his burrow  suddenly confronted   work   dozen busy navvies digging  foundations   house i felt  first inkling   thing  presently grew quite clear  my mind  oppressed me  many days  sense  dethronement  persuasion  i  no longer  master but  animal among  animals under  martian heel with us  would    them  lurk  watch  run  hide  fear  empire  man had passed away but so soon  this strangeness had been realised  passed  my dominant motive became  hunger  my long  dismal fast in  direction away   pit i saw beyond  redcovered wall  patch  garden ground unburied this gave me  hint  i went kneedeep  sometimes neckdeep   red weed the density   weed gave me  reassuring sense  hiding the wall  some six feet high  when i attempted  clamber  i found i could not lift my feet   crest so i went along   side  it  came   corner   rockwork  enabled me  get   top  tumble into  garden i coveted here i found some young onions  couple  gladiolus bulbs   quantity  immature carrots all  which i secured and scrambling over  ruined wall went  my way through scarlet  crimson trees towards kew—it  like walking through  avenue  gigantic blood drops—possessed  two ideas  get more food   limp  soon   far  my strength permitted out  this accursed unearthly region   pit some way farther   grassy place   group  mushrooms which also i devoured  then i came upon  brown sheet  flowing shallow water where meadows used  be these fragments  nourishment served only  whet my hunger at first i  surprised  this flood   hot dry summer but afterwards i discovered    caused   tropical exuberance   red weed directly this extraordinary growth encountered water  straightway became gigantic   unparalleled fecundity its seeds  simply poured down into  water   wey  thames   swiftly growing  titanic water fronds speedily choked both those rivers at putney  i afterwards saw  bridge  almost lost   tangle  this weed   richmond too  thames water poured   broad  shallow stream across  meadows  hampton  twickenham as  water spread  weed followed them until  ruined villas   thames valley    time lost  this red swamp whose margin i explored  much   desolation  martians had caused  concealed in  end  red weed succumbed almost  quickly   had spread a cankering disease due   believed   action  certain bacteria presently seized upon it now   action  natural selection all terrestrial plants have acquired  resisting power against bacterial diseases—they never succumb without  severe struggle but  red weed rotted like  thing already dead the fronds became bleached  then shrivelled  brittle they broke off   least touch   waters  had stimulated their early growth carried their last vestiges out  sea my first act  coming  this water was  course  slake my thirst i drank  great deal   and moved   impulse gnawed some fronds  red weed but they  watery  had  sickly metallic taste i found  water  sufficiently shallow  me  wade securely although  red weed impeded my feet  little but  flood evidently got deeper towards  river  i turned back  mortlake i managed  make out  road  means  occasional ruins   villas  fences  lamps  so presently i got out  this spate  made my way   hill going up towards roehampton  came out  putney common here  scenery changed   strange  unfamiliar   wreckage   familiar patches  ground exhibited  devastation   cyclone    few score yards i would come upon perfectly undisturbed spaces houses  their blinds trimly drawn  doors closed  if they had been left   day   owners or  if their inhabitants slept within the red weed  less abundant  tall trees along  lane  free   red creeper i hunted  food among  trees finding nothing  i also raided  couple  silent houses but they had already been broken into  ransacked i rested   remainder   daylight   shrubbery being  my enfeebled condition too fatigued  push on all this time i saw no human beings  no signs   martians i encountered  couple  hungrylooking dogs but both hurried circuitously away   advances i made them near roehampton i had seen two human skeletons—not bodies but skeletons picked clean—and   wood  me i found  crushed  scattered bones  several cats  rabbits   skull   sheep but though i gnawed parts  these  my mouth there  nothing   got  them after sunset i struggled  along  road towards putney where i think  heatray must have been used  some reason and   garden beyond roehampton i got  quantity  immature potatoes sufficient  stay my hunger from this garden one looked down upon putney   river the aspect   place   dusk  singularly desolate blackened trees blackened desolate ruins  down  hill  sheets   flooded river redtinged   weed and over all—silence it filled me  indescribable terror  think how swiftly  desolating change had come for  time i believed  mankind had been swept out  existence   i stood there alone  last man left alive hard   top  putney hill i came upon another skeleton   arms dislocated  removed several yards   rest   body as i proceeded i became more  more convinced   extermination  mankind was save  such stragglers  myself already accomplished  this part   world the martians i thought had gone   left  country desolated seeking food elsewhere perhaps even now they  destroying berlin or paris or  might  they had gone northward vii the man on putney hill i spent  night   inn  stands   top  putney hill sleeping   made bed   first time since my flight  leatherhead i  not tell  needless trouble i had breaking into  house—afterwards i found  front door    latch—nor how i ransacked every room  food until just   verge  despair  what seemed  me    servant’s bedroom i found  ratgnawed crust  two tins  pineapple the place had been already searched  emptied in  bar i afterwards found some biscuits  sandwiches  had been overlooked the latter i could not eat they  too rotten but  former not only stayed my hunger but filled my pockets i lit no lamps fearing some martian might come beating  part  london  food   night before i went  bed i had  interval  restlessness  prowled  window  window peering out  some sign  these monsters i slept little as i lay  bed i found myself thinking consecutively—a thing i do not remember  have done since my last argument   curate during all  intervening time my mental condition had been  hurrying succession  vague emotional states or  sort  stupid receptivity but   night my brain reinforced i suppose   food i had eaten grew clear again  i thought three things struggled  possession  my mind  killing   curate  whereabouts   martians   possible fate  my wife the former gave me no sensation  horror or remorse  recall i saw  simply   thing done  memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without  quality  remorse i saw myself then  i see myself now driven step  step towards  hasty blow  creature   sequence  accidents leading inevitably  that i felt no condemnation yet  memory static unprogressive haunted me in  silence   night   sense   nearness  god  sometimes comes into  stillness   darkness i stood my trial my only trial   moment  wrath  fear i retraced every step  our conversation   moment when i had found him crouching beside me heedless  my thirst  pointing   fire  smoke  streamed up   ruins  weybridge we had been incapable  cooperation—grim chance had taken no heed  that had i foreseen i should have left him  halliford but i did not foresee  crime   foresee  do and i set this down  i have set all this story down   was there  no witnesses—all these things i might have concealed but i set  down   reader must form his judgment   will and when   effort i had set aside  picture   prostrate body i faced  problem   martians   fate  my wife for  former i had no data i could imagine  hundred things  so unhappily i could   latter and suddenly  night became terrible i found myself sitting up  bed staring   dark i found myself praying   heatray might have suddenly  painlessly struck her out  being since  night  my return  leatherhead i had not prayed i had uttered prayers fetish prayers had prayed  heathens mutter charms when i   extremity but now i prayed indeed pleading steadfastly  sanely face  face   darkness  god strange night strangest  this  so soon  dawn had come i who had talked  god crept out   house like  rat leaving  hiding place—a creature scarcely larger  inferior animal  thing   any passing whim  our masters might  hunted  killed perhaps they also prayed confidently  god surely if we have learned nothing else this war  taught us pity—pity  those witless souls  suffer our dominion the morning  bright  fine   eastern sky glowed pink   fretted  little golden clouds in  road  runs   top  putney hill  wimbledon   number  poor vestiges   panic torrent  must have poured londonward   sunday night after  fighting began there   little twowheeled cart inscribed   name  thomas lobb greengrocer new malden   smashed wheel   abandoned tin trunk there   straw hat trampled into  now hardened mud    top  west hill  lot  bloodstained glass about  overturned water trough my movements  languid my plans   vaguest i had  idea  going  leatherhead though i knew  there i had  poorest chance  finding my wife certainly unless death had overtaken them suddenly my cousins  she would have fled thence but  seemed  me i might find or learn there whither  surrey people had fled i knew i wanted  find my wife  my heart ached  her   world  men but i had no clear idea how  finding might  done i  also sharply aware now  my intense loneliness from  corner i went under cover   thicket  trees  bushes   edge  wimbledon common stretching wide  far that dark expanse  lit  patches  yellow gorse  broom there  no red weed   seen   i prowled hesitating   verge   open  sun rose flooding  all  light  vitality i came upon  busy swarm  little frogs   swampy place among  trees i stopped  look  them drawing  lesson  their stout resolve  live and presently turning suddenly   odd feeling  being watched i beheld something crouching amid  clump  bushes i stood regarding this i made  step towards it   rose up  became  man armed   cutlass i approached him slowly he stood silent  motionless regarding me as i drew nearer i perceived   dressed  clothes  dusty  filthy  my own  looked indeed  though  had been dragged through  culvert nearer i distinguished  green slime  ditches mixing   pale drab  dried clay  shiny coaly patches his black hair fell over his eyes  his face  dark  dirty  sunken so   first i did not recognise him there   red cut across  lower part  his face “stop”  cried when i  within ten yards  him  i stopped his voice  hoarse “where do you come from”  said i thought surveying him “i come  mortlake” i said “i  buried near  pit  martians made about their cylinder i have worked my way out  escaped” “there  no food about here”  said “this  my country all this hill down   river  back  clapham  up   edge   common there  only food  one which way  you going” i answered slowly “i don’t know” i said “i have been buried   ruins   house thirteen or fourteen days i don’t know what  happened” he looked  me doubtfully then started  looked   changed expression “i’ve no wish  stop about here” said i “i think i shall go  leatherhead  my wife  there” he shot out  pointing finger “it  you” said he “the man  woking and you weren’t killed  weybridge” i recognised him   same moment “you   artilleryman who came into my garden” “good luck”  said “we  lucky ones fancy you” he put out  hand  i took it “i crawled up  drain”  said “but they didn’t kill everyone and after they went away i got off towards walton across  fields but—— it’s not sixteen days altogether—and your hair  grey” he looked over his shoulder suddenly “only  rook”  said “one gets  know  birds have shadows these days this   bit open let us crawl under those bushes  talk” “have you seen any martians” i said “since i crawled out——” “they’ve gone away across london”  said “i guess they’ve got  bigger camp there of  night all over there hampstead way  sky  alive  their lights it’s like  great city    glare you can just see them moving by daylight you can’t but nearer—i haven’t seen them—” he counted  his fingers “five days then i saw  couple across hammersmith way carrying something big and  night before last”—he stopped  spoke impressively—“it  just  matter  lights but   something up   air i believe they’ve built  flyingmachine   learning  fly” i stopped  hands  knees  we had come   bushes “fly” “yes”  said “fly” i went  into  little bower  sat down “it  all over  humanity” i said “if they can do  they  simply go round  world” he nodded “they will but—— it  relieve things over here  bit and besides——” he looked  me “aren’t you satisfied  is up  humanity i am we’re down we’re beat” i stared strange   may seem i had not arrived  this fact—a fact perfectly obvious so soon   spoke i had still held  vague hope rather i had kept  lifelong habit  mind he repeated his words “we’re beat” they carried absolute conviction “it’s all over”  said “they’ve lost one—just one and they’ve made their footing good  crippled  greatest power   world they’ve walked over us the death   one  weybridge   accident and these  only pioneers they kept  coming these green stars—i’ve seen none these five or six days but i’ve no doubt they’re falling somewhere every night nothing’s   done we’re under we’re beat” i made him no answer i sat staring before me trying  vain  devise some countervailing thought “this isn’t  war” said  artilleryman “it never   war any more than there’s war between man  ants” suddenly i recalled  night   observatory “after  tenth shot they fired no more—at least until  first cylinder came” “how do you know” said  artilleryman i explained he thought “something wrong   gun”  said “but what if there is they’ll get  right again and even if there’s  delay how can  alter  end it’s just men  ants there’s  ants builds their cities live their lives have wars revolutions until  men want them out   way  then they go out   way that’s what we  now—just ants only——” “yes” i said “we’re eatable ants” we sat looking  each other “and what  they do  us” i said “that’s what i’ve been thinking”  said “that’s what i’ve been thinking after weybridge i went south—thinking i saw what  up most   people  hard   squealing  exciting themselves but i’m not so fond  squealing i’ve been  sight  death once or twice i’m not  ornamental soldier    best  worst death—it’s just death and it’s  man  keeps  thinking comes through i saw everyone tracking away south says i ‘food won’t last this way’  i turned right back i went   martians like  sparrow goes  man all round”—he waved  hand   horizon—“they’re starving  heaps bolting treading  each other   ” he saw my face  halted awkwardly “no doubt lots who had money have gone away  france”  said he seemed  hesitate whether  apologise met my eyes  went on “there’s food all about here canned things  shops wines spirits mineral waters   water mains  drains  empty well i  telling you what i  thinking ‘here’s intelligent things’ i said ‘and  seems they want us  food first they’ll smash us up—ships machines guns cities all  order  organisation all   go if we   size  ants we might pull through but we’re not it’s all too bulky  stop that’s  first certainty’ eh” i assented “it is i’ve thought  out very well then—next  present we’re caught  we’re wanted a martian  only  go  few miles  get  crowd   run and i saw one one day out  wandsworth picking houses  pieces  routing among  wreckage but they won’t keep  doing that so soon  they’ve settled all our guns  ships  smashed our railways  done all  things they  doing over there they  begin catching us systematic picking  best  storing us  cages  things that’s what they  start doing   bit lord they haven’t begun  us yet don’t you see that” “not begun” i exclaimed “not begun all that’s happened so far  through our not having  sense  keep quiet—worrying them  guns  such foolery and losing our heads  rushing off  crowds  where there wasn’t any more safety than where we were they don’t want  bother us yet they’re making their things—making all  things they couldn’t bring  them getting things ready   rest  their people very likely that’s why  cylinders have stopped   bit  fear  hitting those who  here and instead  our rushing about blind   howl or getting dynamite   chance  busting them up we’ve got  fix ourselves up according   new state  affairs that’s how i figure  out it isn’t quite according  what  man wants  his species but it’s about what  facts point to and that’s  principle i acted upon cities nations civilisation progress—it’s all over that game’s up we’re beat” “but if   so what  there  live for” the artilleryman looked  me   moment “there won’t  any more blessed concerts   million years or so there won’t  any royal academy  arts  no nice little feeds  restaurants if it’s amusement you’re after i reckon  game  up if you’ve got any drawingroom manners or  dislike  eating peas   knife or dropping aitches you’d better chuck ’em away they ain’t no further use” “you mean——” “i mean  men like me  going  living—for  sake   breed i tell you i’m grim set  living and if i’m not mistaken you’ll show what insides you’ve got too before long we aren’t going   exterminated and i don’t mean   caught either  tamed  fattened  bred like  thundering ox ugh fancy those brown creepers” “you don’t mean  say——” “i do i’m going on under their feet i’ve got  planned i’ve thought  out we men  beat we don’t know enough we’ve got  learn before we’ve got  chance and we’ve got  live  keep independent while we learn see that’s what    done” i stared astonished  stirred profoundly   man’s resolution “great god” cried i “but you   man indeed” and suddenly i gripped his hand “eh”  said  his eyes shining “i’ve thought  out eh” “go on” i said “well those who mean  escape their catching must get ready i’m getting ready mind you  isn’t all  us   made  wild beasts  that’s what it’s got  be that’s why i watched you i had my doubts you’re slender i didn’t know    you you see or just how you’d been buried all these—the sort  people  lived  these houses  all those damn little clerks  used  live down that way—they’d  no good they haven’t any spirit  them—no proud dreams  no proud lusts   man who hasn’t one or  other—lord what   but funk  precautions they just used  skedaddle off  work—i’ve seen hundreds  ’em bit  breakfast  hand running wild  shining  catch their little seasonticket train  fear they’d get dismissed if they didn’t working  businesses they  afraid  take  trouble  understand skedaddling back  fear they wouldn’t   time  dinner keeping indoors after dinner  fear   back streets  sleeping   wives they married not because they wanted them but because they had  bit  money  would make  safety  their one little miserable skedaddle through  world lives insured   bit invested  fear  accidents and  sundays—fear   hereafter as if hell  built  rabbits well  martians  just   godsend  these nice roomy cages fattening food careful breeding no worry after  week or so chasing about  fields  lands  empty stomachs they’ll come   caught cheerful they’ll  quite glad after  bit they’ll wonder what people did before there  martians  take care  them and  bar loafers  mashers  singers—i can imagine them i can imagine them”  said   sort  sombre gratification “there’ll  any amount  sentiment  religion loose among them there’s hundreds  things i saw  my eyes  i’ve only begun  see clearly these last few days there’s lots  take things  they are—fat  stupid  lots   worried   sort  feeling  it’s all wrong   they ought   doing something now whenever things  so   lot  people feel they ought   doing something  weak  those who go weak   lot  complicated thinking always make   sort  donothing religion very pious  superior  submit  persecution      lord very likely you’ve seen  same thing it’s energy   gale  funk  turned clean inside out these cages   full  psalms  hymns  piety and those   less simple sort  work   bit of—what  it—eroticism” he paused “very likely these martians  make pets  some  them train them  do tricks—who knows—get sentimental over  pet boy who grew up  had   killed and some maybe they  train  hunt us” “no” i cried “that’s impossible no human being——” “what’s  good  going   such lies” said  artilleryman “there’s men who’d do  cheerful what nonsense  pretend there isn’t” and i succumbed  his conviction “if they come after me”  said “lord if they come after me”  subsided into  grim meditation i sat contemplating these things i could find nothing  bring against this man’s reasoning in  days before  invasion no one would have questioned my intellectual superiority  his—i  professed  recognised writer  philosophical themes  he  common soldier  yet  had already formulated  situation  i had scarcely realised “what  you doing” i said presently “what plans have you made” he hesitated “well it’s like this”  said “what have we  do we have  invent  sort  life where men can live  breed   sufficiently secure  bring  children up yes—wait  bit  i’ll make  clearer what i think ought   done the tame ones  go like all tame beasts   few generations they’ll  big beautiful richblooded stupid—rubbish the risk   we who keep wild  go savage—degenerate into  sort  big savage rat    you see how i mean  live  underground i’ve been thinking about  drains of course those who don’t know drains think horrible things but under this london  miles  miles—hundreds  miles—and  few days rain  london empty  leave them sweet  clean the main drains  big enough  airy enough  anyone then there’s cellars vaults stores  which bolting passages may  made   drains and  railway tunnels  subways eh you begin  see and we form  band—ablebodied cleanminded men we’re not going  pick up any rubbish  drifts in weaklings go out again” “as you meant me  go” “well—i parleyed didn’t i” “we won’t quarrel about that go on” “those who stop obey orders ablebodied cleanminded women we want also—mothers  teachers no lackadaisical ladies—no blasted rolling eyes we can’t have any weak or silly life  real again   useless  cumbersome  mischievous have  die they ought  die they ought   willing  die it’s  sort  disloyalty after all  live  taint  race and they can’t  happy moreover dying’s none so dreadful it’s  funking makes  bad and  all those places we shall gather our district   london and we may even  able  keep  watch  run about   open when  martians keep away play cricket perhaps that’s how we shall save  race eh it’s  possible thing but saving  race  nothing  itself as i say that’s only being rats it’s saving our knowledge  adding     thing there men like you come in there’s books there’s models we must make great safe places down deep  get all  books we can not novels  poetry swipes but ideas science books that’s where men like you come in we must go   british museum  pick all those books through especially we must keep up our science—learn more we must watch these martians some  us must go  spies when it’s all working perhaps i will get caught i mean and  great thing is we must leave  martians alone we mustn’t even steal if we get  their way we clear out we must show them we mean no harm yes i know but they’re intelligent things  they won’t hunt us down if they have all they want  think we’re just harmless vermin” the artilleryman paused  laid  brown hand upon my arm “after all  may not  so much we may have  learn before—just imagine this four or five  their fighting machines suddenly starting off—heatrays right  left  not  martian  ’em not  martian  ’em but men—men who have learned  way how it may   my time even—those men fancy having one  them lovely things   heatray wide  free fancy having   control what would  matter if you smashed  smithereens   end   run after  bust like that i reckon  martians’ll open their beautiful eyes can’t you see them man can’t you see them hurrying hurrying—puffing  blowing  hooting  their other mechanical affairs something out  gear  every case and swish bang rattle swish just  they  fumbling over it swish comes  heatray and behold man  come back  his own” for  while  imaginative daring   artilleryman   tone  assurance  courage  assumed completely dominated my mind i believed unhesitatingly both  his forecast  human destiny    practicability  his astonishing scheme   reader who thinks me susceptible  foolish must contrast his position reading steadily  all his thoughts about his subject  mine crouching fearfully   bushes  listening distracted  apprehension we talked  this manner through  early morning time  later crept out   bushes and after scanning  sky  martians hurried precipitately   house  putney hill where  had made his lair it   coal cellar   place  when i saw  work  had spent  week upon—it   burrow scarcely ten yards long which  designed  reach   main drain  putney hill—i had my first inkling   gulf between his dreams  his powers such  hole i could have dug   day but i believed  him sufficiently  work  him all  morning until past midday  his digging we had  garden barrow  shot  earth we removed against  kitchen range we refreshed ourselves   tin  mockturtle soup  wine   neighbouring pantry i found  curious relief   aching strangeness   world  this steady labour as we worked i turned his project over  my mind  presently objections  doubts began  arise but i worked there all  morning so glad  i  find myself   purpose again after working  hour i began  speculate   distance one had  go before  cloaca  reached  chances we had  missing  altogether my immediate trouble  why we should dig this long tunnel when   possible  get into  drain  once down one   manholes  work back   house it seemed  me too   house  inconveniently chosen  required  needless length  tunnel and just  i  beginning  face these things  artilleryman stopped digging  looked  me “we’re working well”  said he put down his spade “let us knock off  bit”  said “i think it’s time we reconnoitred   roof   house” i   going on  after  little hesitation  resumed his spade  then suddenly i  struck   thought i stopped  so did   once “why  you walking about  common” i said “instead  being here” “taking  air”  said “i  coming back it’s safer  night” “but  work” “oh one can’t always work”  said    flash i saw  man plain he hesitated holding his spade “we ought  reconnoitre now”  said “because if any come near they may hear  spades  drop upon us unawares” i  no longer disposed  object we went together   roof  stood   ladder peeping out   roof door no martians    seen  we ventured out   tiles  slipped down under shelter   parapet from this position  shrubbery hid  greater portion  putney but we could see  river below  bubbly mass  red weed   low parts  lambeth flooded  red the red creeper swarmed up  trees about  old palace  their branches stretched gaunt  dead  set  shrivelled leaves  amid  clusters it  strange how entirely dependent both these things  upon flowing water  their propagation about us neither had gained  footing laburnums pink mays snowballs  trees  arborvitae rose out  laurels  hydrangeas green  brilliant into  sunlight beyond kensington dense smoke  rising     blue haze hid  northward hills the artilleryman began  tell me   sort  people who still remained  london “one night last week”  said “some fools got  electric light  order  there  all regent street   circus ablaze crowded  painted  ragged drunkards men  women dancing  shouting till dawn a man who  there told me and   day came they became aware   fightingmachine standing near   langham  looking down  them heaven knows how long  had been there it must have given some  them  nasty turn he came down  road towards them  picked up nearly  hundred too drunk or frightened  run away” grotesque gleam   time no history  ever fully describe from that  answer  my questions  came round  his grandiose plans again he grew enthusiastic he talked so eloquently   possibility  capturing  fightingmachine  i more than half believed  him again but now  i  beginning  understand something  his quality i could divine  stress  laid  doing nothing precipitately and i noted  now there  no question   personally   capture  fight  great machine after  time we went down   cellar neither  us seemed disposed  resume digging  when  suggested  meal i  nothing loath he became suddenly very generous  when we had eaten  went away  returned  some excellent cigars we lit these  his optimism glowed he  inclined  regard my coming   great occasion “there’s some champagne   cellar”  said “we can dig better  this thamesside burgundy” said i “no” said he “i am host today champagne great god we’ve  heavy enough task before us let us take  rest  gather strength while we may look  these blistered hands” and pursuant  this idea   holiday  insisted upon playing cards after we had eaten he taught me euchre  after dividing london between us i taking  northern side    southern we played  parish points grotesque  foolish  this  seem   sober reader   absolutely true  what  more remarkable i found  card game  several others we played extremely interesting strange mind  man that  our species upon  edge  extermination or appalling degradation  no clear prospect before us but  chance   horrible death we could sit following  chance  this painted pasteboard  playing  “joker”  vivid delight afterwards  taught me poker  i beat him  three tough chess games when dark came we decided  take  risk  lit  lamp after  interminable string  games we supped   artilleryman finished  champagne we went  smoking  cigars he  no longer  energetic regenerator  his species i had encountered   morning he  still optimistic but    less kinetic  more thoughtful optimism i remember  wound up  my health proposed   speech  small variety  considerable intermittence i took  cigar  went upstairs  look   lights  which  had spoken  blazed so greenly along  highgate hills at first i stared unintelligently across  london valley the northern hills  shrouded  darkness  fires near kensington glowed redly  now  then  orangered tongue  flame flashed up  vanished   deep blue night all  rest  london  black then nearer i perceived  strange light  pale violetpurple fluorescent glow quivering under  night breeze for  space i could not understand it  then i knew   must   red weed  which this faint irradiation proceeded with  realisation my dormant sense  wonder my sense   proportion  things awoke again i glanced    mars red  clear glowing high   west  then gazed long  earnestly   darkness  hampstead  highgate i remained  very long time upon  roof wondering   grotesque changes   day i recalled my mental states   midnight prayer   foolish cardplaying i had  violent revulsion  feeling i remember i flung away  cigar   certain wasteful symbolism my folly came  me  glaring exaggeration i seemed  traitor  my wife   my kind i  filled  remorse i resolved  leave this strange undisciplined dreamer  great things  his drink  gluttony   go  into london there  seemed  me i had  best chance  learning what  martians  my fellowmen  doing i  still upon  roof when  late moon rose viii dead london after i had parted   artilleryman i went down  hill    high street across  bridge  fulham the red weed  tumultuous   time  nearly choked  bridge roadway but  fronds  already whitened  patches   spreading disease  presently removed  so swiftly at  corner   lane  runs  putney bridge station i found  man lying he   black   sweep   black dust alive but helplessly  speechlessly drunk i could get nothing  him but curses  furious lunges  my head i think i should have stayed  him but   brutal expression  his face there  black dust along  roadway   bridge onwards   grew thicker  fulham the streets  horribly quiet i got food—sour hard  mouldy but quite eatable—in  baker’s shop here some way towards walham green  streets became clear  powder  i passed  white terrace  houses  fire  noise   burning   absolute relief going  towards brompton  streets  quiet again here i came once more upon  black powder   streets  upon dead bodies i saw altogether about  dozen   length   fulham road they had been dead many days so  i hurried quickly past them the black powder covered them over  softened their outlines one or two had been disturbed  dogs where there  no black powder   curiously like  sunday   city   closed shops  houses locked up   blinds drawn  desertion   stillness in some places plunderers had been  work but rarely  other than  provision  wine shops a jeweller’s window had been broken open  one place but apparently  thief had been disturbed   number  gold chains   watch lay scattered   pavement i did not trouble  touch them farther    tattered woman   heap   doorstep  hand  hung over her knee  gashed  bled down her rusty brown dress   smashed magnum  champagne formed  pool across  pavement she seemed asleep but she  dead the farther i penetrated into london  profounder grew  stillness but   not so much  stillness  death—it   stillness  suspense  expectation at any time  destruction  had already singed  northwestern borders   metropolis  had annihilated ealing  kilburn might strike among these houses  leave them smoking ruins it   city condemned  derelict    in south kensington  streets  clear  dead   black powder it  near south kensington  i first heard  howling it crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses it   sobbing alternation  two notes “ulla ulla ulla ulla” keeping  perpetually when i passed streets  ran northward  grew  volume  houses  buildings seemed  deaden  cut  off again it came   full tide down exhibition road i stopped staring towards kensington gardens wondering  this strange remote wailing it   if  mighty desert  houses had found  voice   fear  solitude “ulla ulla ulla ulla” wailed  superhuman note—great waves  sound sweeping down  broad sunlit roadway between  tall buildings  each side i turned northwards marvelling towards  iron gates  hyde park i had half  mind  break into  natural history museum  find my way up   summits   towers  order  see across  park but i decided  keep   ground where quick hiding  possible  so went  up  exhibition road all  large mansions  each side   road  empty  still  my footsteps echoed against  sides   houses at  top near  park gate i came upon  strange sight—a bus overturned   skeleton   horse picked clean i puzzled over this   time  then went    bridge over  serpentine the voice grew stronger  stronger though i could see nothing above  housetops   north side   park save  haze  smoke   northwest “ulla ulla ulla ulla” cried  voice coming   seemed  me   district about regent’s park the desolating cry worked upon my mind the mood  had sustained me passed the wailing took possession  me i found i  intensely weary footsore  now again hungry  thirsty it  already past noon why  i wandering alone  this city   dead why  i alone when all london  lying  state    black shroud i felt intolerably lonely my mind ran  old friends  i had forgotten  years i thought   poisons   chemists’ shops   liquors  wine merchants stored i recalled  two sodden creatures  despair who so far  i knew shared  city  myself    i came into oxford street   marble arch  here again  black powder  several bodies   evil ominous smell   gratings   cellars  some   houses i grew very thirsty after  heat  my long walk with infinite trouble i managed  break into  publichouse  get food  drink i  weary after eating  went into  parlour behind  bar  slept   black horsehair sofa i found there i awoke  find  dismal howling still  my ears “ulla ulla ulla ulla” it  now dusk  after i had routed out some biscuits   cheese   bar—there   meat safe but  contained nothing but maggots—i wandered  through  silent residential squares  baker street—portman square   only one i can name—and so came out  last upon regent’s park and  i emerged   top  baker street i saw far away over  trees   clearness   sunset  hood   martian giant  which this howling proceeded i  not terrified i came upon him  if    matter  course i watched him  some time but  did not move he appeared   standing  yelling  no reason  i could discover i tried  formulate  plan  action that perpetual sound  “ulla ulla ulla ulla” confused my mind perhaps i  too tired   very fearful certainly i  more curious  know  reason  this monotonous crying than afraid i turned back away   park  struck into park road intending  skirt  park went along under  shelter   terraces  got  view  this stationary howling martian   direction  st john’s wood a couple  hundred yards out  baker street i heard  yelping chorus  saw first  dog   piece  putrescent red meat  his jaws coming headlong towards me  then  pack  starving mongrels  pursuit  him he made  wide curve  avoid me  though  feared i might prove  fresh competitor as  yelping died away down  silent road  wailing sound  “ulla ulla ulla ulla” reasserted itself i came upon  wrecked handlingmachine halfway  st john’s wood station at first i thought  house had fallen across  road it  only  i clambered among  ruins  i saw   start this mechanical samson lying   tentacles bent  smashed  twisted among  ruins  had made the forepart  shattered it seemed  if  had driven blindly straight   house  had been overwhelmed   overthrow it seemed  me then  this might have happened   handlingmachine escaping   guidance   martian i could not clamber among  ruins  see it   twilight  now so far advanced   blood  which  seat  smeared   gnawed gristle   martian   dogs had left  invisible  me wondering still more  all  i had seen i pushed  towards primrose hill far away through  gap   trees i saw  second martian  motionless   first standing   park towards  zoological gardens  silent a little beyond  ruins about  smashed handlingmachine i came upon  red weed again  found  regent’s canal  spongy mass  darkred vegetation as i crossed  bridge  sound  “ulla ulla ulla ulla” ceased it was   were cut off the silence came like  thunderclap the dusky houses about me stood faint  tall  dim  trees towards  park  growing black all about me  red weed clambered among  ruins writhing  get above me   dimness night  mother  fear  mystery  coming upon me but while  voice sounded  solitude  desolation had been endurable  virtue   london had still seemed alive   sense  life about me had upheld me then suddenly  change  passing  something—i knew not what—and then  stillness  could  felt nothing but this gaunt quiet london about me gazed  me spectrally the windows   white houses  like  eye sockets  skulls about me my imagination found  thousand noiseless enemies moving terror seized me  horror  my temerity in front  me  road became pitchy black  though   tarred  i saw  contorted shape lying across  pathway i could not bring myself  go on i turned down st john’s wood road  ran headlong  this unendurable stillness towards kilburn i hid   night   silence until long after midnight   cabmen’s shelter  harrow road but before  dawn my courage returned  while  stars  still   sky i turned once more towards regent’s park i missed my way among  streets  presently saw down  long avenue   halflight   early dawn  curve  primrose hill on  summit towering up   fading stars   third martian erect  motionless like  others an insane resolve possessed me i would die  end it and i would save myself even  trouble  killing myself i marched  recklessly towards this titan  then  i drew nearer   light grew i saw   multitude  black birds  circling  clustering about  hood at  my heart gave  bound  i began running along  road i hurried through  red weed  choked st edmund’s terrace i waded breasthigh across  torrent  water   rushing down   waterworks towards  albert road  emerged upon  grass before  rising   sun great mounds had been heaped about  crest   hill making  huge redoubt  it—it   final  largest place  martians had made—and  behind these heaps there rose  thin smoke against  sky against  sky line  eager dog ran  disappeared the thought  had flashed into my mind grew real grew credible i felt no fear only  wild trembling exultation  i ran up  hill towards  motionless monster out   hood hung lank shreds  brown  which  hungry birds pecked  tore in another moment i had scrambled up  earthen rampart  stood upon  crest   interior   redoubt  below me a mighty space  was  gigantic machines here  there within it huge mounds  material  strange shelter places and scattered about it some  their overturned warmachines some   now rigid handlingmachines   dozen  them stark  silent  laid   row   martians—dead—slain   putrefactive  disease bacteria against which their systems  unprepared slain   red weed  being slain slain after all man’s devices had failed   humblest things  god  his wisdom  put upon this earth for so  had come about  indeed i  many men might have foreseen had not terror  disaster blinded our minds these germs  disease have taken toll  humanity since  beginning  things—taken toll  our prehuman ancestors since life began here but  virtue  this natural selection  our kind we have developed resisting power  no germs do we succumb without  struggle   many—those  cause putrefaction  dead matter  instance—our living frames  altogether immune but there  no bacteria  mars  directly these invaders arrived directly they drank  fed our microscopic allies began  work their overthrow already when i watched them they  irrevocably doomed dying  rotting even  they went   fro it  inevitable by  toll   billion deaths man  bought his birthright   earth    his against all comers  would still  his   martians ten times  mighty  they are for neither do men live nor die  vain here  there they  scattered nearly fifty altogether   great gulf they had made overtaken   death  must have seemed  them  incomprehensible  any death could be to me also   time this death  incomprehensible all i knew   these things  had been alive  so terrible  men  dead for  moment i believed   destruction  sennacherib had been repeated  god had repented   angel  death had slain them   night i stood staring into  pit  my heart lightened gloriously even   rising sun struck  world  fire about me  his rays the pit  still  darkness  mighty engines so great  wonderful  their power  complexity so unearthly  their tortuous forms rose weird  vague  strange out   shadows towards  light a multitude  dogs i could hear fought over  bodies  lay darkly   depth   pit far below me across  pit   farther lip flat  vast  strange lay  great flyingmachine  which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when decay  death arrested them death had come not  day too soon at  sound   cawing overhead i looked up   huge fightingmachine  would fight no more  ever   tattered red shreds  flesh  dripped down upon  overturned seats   summit  primrose hill i turned  looked down  slope   hill  where enhaloed now  birds stood those other two martians  i had seen overnight just  death had overtaken them the one had died even   had been crying   companions perhaps    last  die   voice had gone  perpetually until  force   machinery  exhausted they glittered now harmless tripod towers  shining metal   brightness   rising sun all about  pit  saved    miracle  everlasting destruction stretched

innumerable hosts  lives  had gone  build this human reef    swift  ruthless destruction  had hung over  all when i realised   shadow had been rolled back   men might still live   streets  this dear vast dead city  mine  once more alive  powerful i felt  wave  emotion   near akin  tears the torment  over even  day  healing would begin the survivors   people scattered over  country—leaderless lawless foodless like sheep without  shepherd—the thousands who had fled  sea would begin  return  pulse  life growing stronger  stronger would beat again   empty streets  pour across  vacant squares whatever destruction  done  hand   destroyer  stayed all  gaunt wrecks  blackened skeletons  houses  stared so dismally   sunlit grass   hill would presently  echoing   hammers   restorers  ringing

helpfulness  had ceased  ever ix wreckage and now comes  strangest thing  my story yet perhaps   not altogether strange i remember clearly  coldly  vividly all  i did  day until  time  i stood weeping  praising god upon  summit  primrose hill and then i forget of  next three days i know nothing i have learned since that so far  my being  first discoverer   martian overthrow several such wanderers  myself had already discovered this   previous night one man—the first—had gone  st martin’slegrand and while i sheltered   cabmen’s hut had contrived  telegraph  paris thence  joyful news had flashed all over  world  thousand cities chilled  ghastly apprehensions suddenly flashed into frantic illuminations they knew    dublin edinburgh manchester birmingham   time when i stood upon  verge   pit already men weeping  joy  i have heard shouting  staying their work  shake hands  shout  making up trains even  near  crewe  descend upon london the church bells  had ceased  fortnight since suddenly caught  news until all england  bellringing men  cycles leanfaced unkempt scorched along every country lane shouting  unhoped deliverance shouting  gaunt staring figures  despair and   food across  channel across  irish sea across  atlantic corn bread  meat  tearing  our relief all  shipping   world seemed going londonward  those days but  all this i have no memory i drifted—a demented man i found myself   house  kindly people who had found me   third day wandering weeping  raving through  streets  st john’s wood they have told me since  i  singing some insane doggerel about “the last man left alive hurrah the last man left alive” troubled  they   their own affairs these people whose name much  i would like  express my gratitude  them i may not even give here nevertheless cumbered themselves  me sheltered me  protected me  myself apparently they had learned something  my story  me during  days  my lapse very gently when my mind  assured again did they break  me what they had learned   fate  leatherhead two days after i  imprisoned  had been destroyed  every soul  it   martian he had swept  out  existence   seemed without any provocation   boy might crush  ant hill   mere wantonness  power i   lonely man  they  very kind  me i   lonely man   sad one  they bore  me i remained  them four days after my recovery all  time i felt  vague  growing craving  look once more  whatever remained   little life  seemed so happy  bright  my past it   mere hopeless desire  feast upon my misery they dissuaded me they did all they could  divert me  this morbidity but  last i could resist  impulse no longer and promising faithfully  return  them  parting  i  confess  these fourday friends  tears i went out again into  streets  had lately been so dark  strange  empty already they  busy  returning people  places even there  shops open  i saw  drinking fountain running water i remember how mockingly bright  day seemed  i went back  my melancholy pilgrimage   little house  woking how busy  streets  vivid  moving life about me so many people  abroad everywhere busied   thousand activities   seemed incredible  any great proportion   population could have been slain but then i noticed how yellow   skins   people i met how shaggy  hair   men how large  bright their eyes   every other man still wore his dirty rags their faces seemed all  one  two expressions—a leaping exultation  energy or  grim resolution save   expression   faces london seemed  city  tramps the vestries  indiscriminately distributing bread sent us   french government the ribs   few horses showed dismally haggard special constables  white badges stood   corners  every street i saw little   mischief wrought   martians until i reached wellington street  there i saw  red weed clambering over  buttresses  waterloo bridge at  corner   bridge too i saw one   common contrasts   grotesque time—a sheet  paper flaunting against  thicket   red weed transfixed   stick  kept   place it   placard   first newspaper  resume publication—the daily mail i bought  copy   blackened shilling i found  my pocket most     blank but  solitary compositor who did  thing had amused himself  making  grotesque scheme  advertisement stereo   back page the matter  printed  emotional  news organisation had not  yet found  way back i learned nothing fresh except  already  one week  examination   martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results among other things  article assured me what i did not believe   time   “secret  flying”  discovered at waterloo i found  free trains   taking people  their homes the first rush  already over there  few people   train  i   no mood  casual conversation i got  compartment  myself  sat  folded arms looking greyly   sunlit devastation  flowed past  windows and just outside  terminus  train jolted over temporary rails   either side   railway  houses  blackened ruins to clapham junction  face  london  grimy  powder   black smoke  spite  two days  thunderstorms  rain   clapham junction  line had been wrecked again there  hundreds  outofwork clerks  shopmen working side  side   customary navvies  we  jolted over  hasty relaying all down  line  there  aspect   country  gaunt  unfamiliar wimbledon particularly had suffered walton  virtue   unburned pine woods seemed  least hurt  any place along  line the wandle  mole every little stream   heaped mass  red weed  appearance between butcher’s meat  pickled cabbage the surrey pine woods  too dry however   festoons   red climber beyond wimbledon within sight   line  certain nursery grounds   heaped masses  earth about  sixth cylinder a number  people  standing about it  some sappers  busy   midst  it over  flaunted  union jack flapping cheerfully   morning breeze the nursery grounds  everywhere crimson   weed  wide expanse  livid colour cut  purple shadows  very painful   eye one’s gaze went  infinite relief   scorched greys  sullen reds   foreground   bluegreen softness   eastward hills the line   london side  woking station  still undergoing repair so i descended  byfleet station  took  road  maybury past  place where i   artilleryman had talked   hussars     spot where  martian had appeared  me   thunderstorm here moved  curiosity i turned aside  find among  tangle  red fronds  warped  broken dog cart   whitened bones   horse scattered  gnawed for  time i stood regarding these vestiges    then i returned through  pine wood neckhigh  red weed here  there  find  landlord   spotted dog had already found burial  so came home past  college arms a man standing   open cottage door greeted me  name  i passed i looked  my house   quick flash  hope  faded immediately the door had been forced   unfast   opening slowly  i approached it slammed again the curtains  my study fluttered out   open window  which i   artilleryman had watched  dawn no one had closed  since the smashed bushes  just  i had left them nearly four weeks ago i stumbled into  hall   house felt empty the stair carpet  ruffled  discoloured where i had crouched soaked   skin   thunderstorm  night   catastrophe our muddy footsteps i saw still went up  stairs i followed them  my study  found lying  my writingtable still   selenite paper weight upon it  sheet  work i had left   afternoon   opening   cylinder for  space i stood reading over my abandoned arguments it   paper   probable development  moral ideas   development   civilising process   last sentence   opening   prophecy “in about two hundred years” i had written “we may expect——” the sentence ended abruptly i remembered my inability  fix my mind  morning scarcely  month gone by  how i had broken off  get my daily chronicle   newsboy i remembered how i went down   garden gate   came along  how i had listened  his odd story  “men  mars” i came down  went into  dining room there   mutton   bread both far gone now  decay   beer bottle overturned just  i   artilleryman had left them my home  desolate i perceived  folly   faint hope i had cherished so long and then  strange thing occurred “it  no use” said  voice “the house  deserted no one  been here these ten days do not stay here  torment yourself no one escaped but you” i  startled had i spoken my thought aloud i turned   french window  open behind me i made  step  it  stood looking out and there amazed  afraid even  i stood amazed  afraid  my cousin  my wife—my wife white  tearless she gave  faint cry “i came” she said “i knew—knew——” she put her hand  her throat—swayed i made  step forward  caught her  my arms x the epilogue i cannot but regret now  i am concluding my story how little i am able  contribute   discussion   many debatable questions which  still unsettled in one respect i shall certainly provoke criticism my particular province  speculative philosophy my knowledge  comparative physiology  confined   book or two but  seems  me  carver’s suggestions    reason   rapid death   martians  so probable    regarded almost   proven conclusion i have assumed    body  my narrative at any rate  all  bodies   martians   examined after  war no bacteria except those already known  terrestrial species  found that they did not bury any  their dead   reckless slaughter they perpetrated point also   entire ignorance   putrefactive process but probable  this seems    no means  proven conclusion neither   composition   black smoke known which  martians used  such deadly effect   generator   heatrays remains  puzzle the terrible disasters   ealing  south kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts  further investigations upon  latter spectrum analysis   black powder points unmistakably   presence   unknown element   brilliant group  three lines   green    possible   combines  argon  form  compound which acts  once  deadly effect upon some constituent   blood but such unproven speculations  scarcely   interest   general reader  whom this story  addressed none   brown scum  drifted down  thames after  destruction  shepperton  examined   time  now none  forthcoming the results   anatomical examination   martians so far   prowling dogs had left such  examination possible i have already given but everyone  familiar   magnificent  almost complete specimen  spirits   natural history museum   countless drawings  have been made  it  beyond   interest  their physiology  structure  purely scientific a question  graver  universal interest   possibility  another attack   martians i do not think  nearly enough attention  being given  this aspect   matter at present  planet mars   conjunction but  every return  opposition i  one anticipate  renewal  their adventure in any case we should  prepared it seems  me   should  possible  define  position   gun  which  shots  discharged  keep  sustained watch upon this part   planet   anticipate  arrival   next attack in  case  cylinder might  destroyed  dynamite or artillery before   sufficiently cool   martians  emerge or they might  butchered  means  guns so soon   screw opened it seems  me  they have lost  vast advantage   failure  their first surprise possibly they see    same light lessing  advanced excellent reasons  supposing   martians have actually succeeded  effecting  landing   planet venus seven months ago now venus  mars   alignment   sun    say mars   opposition   point  view   observer  venus subsequently  peculiar luminous  sinuous marking appeared   unillumined half   inner planet  almost simultaneously  faint dark mark   similar sinuous character  detected upon  photograph   martian disk one needs  see  drawings  these appearances  order  appreciate fully their remarkable resemblance  character at any rate whether we expect another invasion or not our views   human future must  greatly modified  these events we have learned now  we cannot regard this planet  being fenced    secure abiding place  man we can never anticipate  unseen good or evil  may come upon us suddenly out  space it may     larger design   universe this invasion  mars  not without  ultimate benefit  men   robbed us   serene confidence   future which   most fruitful source  decadence  gifts  human science   brought  enormous    done much  promote  conception   commonweal  mankind it may   across  immensity  space  martians have watched  fate  these pioneers  theirs  learned their lesson     planet venus they have found  securer settlement be    may  many years yet there  certainly  no relaxation   eager scrutiny   martian disk  those fiery darts   sky  shooting stars  bring  them  they fall  unavoidable apprehension  all  sons  men the broadening  men’s views   resulted can scarcely  exaggerated before  cylinder fell there   general persuasion  through all  deep  space no life existed beyond  petty surface  our minute sphere now we see further if  martians can reach venus there  no reason  suppose   thing  impossible  men  when  slow cooling   sun makes this earth uninhabitable   last  must do  may    thread  life   begun here  have streamed out  caught our sister planet within  toils dim  wonderful   vision i have conjured up  my mind  life spreading slowly  this little seed bed   solar system throughout  inanimate vastness  sidereal space but    remote dream it may be   other hand   destruction   martians  only  reprieve to them  not  us perhaps   future ordained i must confess  stress  danger   time have left  abiding sense  doubt  insecurity  my mind i sit  my study writing  lamplight  suddenly i see again  healing valley below set  writhing flames  feel  house behind  about me empty  desolate i go out into  byfleet road  vehicles pass me  butcher boy   cart  cabful  visitors  workman   bicycle children going  school  suddenly they become vague  unreal  i hurry again   artilleryman through  hot brooding silence of  night i see  black powder darkening  silent streets   contorted bodies shrouded   layer they rise upon me tattered  dogbitten they gibber  grow fiercer paler uglier mad distortions  humanity  last  i wake cold  wretched   darkness   night i go  london  see  busy multitudes  fleet street   strand   comes across my mind  they  but  ghosts   past haunting  streets  i have seen silent  wretched going   fro phantasms   dead city  mockery  life   galvanised body and strange too    stand  primrose hill  i did but  day before writing this last chapter  see  great province  houses dim  blue through  haze   smoke  mist vanishing  last into  vague lower sky  see  people walking   fro among  flower beds   hill  see  sightseers about  martian
