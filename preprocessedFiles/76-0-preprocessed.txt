done  herself her sister miss watson  tolerable slim old maid  goggles on had just come  live  her  took  set  me now   spellingbook she worked me middling hard  about  hour  then  widow made her ease up i couldnt stood  much longer then   hour   deadly dull  i  fidgety miss watson would say “dont put your feet up there huckleberry”  “dont scrunch up like that huckleberryset up straight”  pretty soon she would say “dont gap  stretch like that huckleberrywhy dont you try  behave” then she told me all about  bad place  i said i wished i  there she got mad then but i didnt mean no harm all i wanted   go somewheres all i wanted   change i warnt particular she said   wicked  say what i said said she wouldnt say    whole world she  going  live so   go   good place well i couldnt see no advantage  going where she  going so i made up my mind i wouldnt try  it but i never said so because  would only make trouble  wouldnt do no good now she had got  start  she went   told me all about  good place she said all  body would have  do there   go around all day long   harp  sing forever  ever so i didnt think much  it but i never said so i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer would go there  she said not   considerable sight i  glad about that because i wanted him  me   together miss watson she kept pecking  me   got tiresome  lonesome by   they fetched  niggers   had prayers  then everybody  off  bed i went up  my room   piece  candle  put    table then i set down   chair   window  tried  think  something cheerful but  warnt no use i felt so lonesome i most wished i  dead the stars  shining   leaves rustled   woods ever so mournful  i heard  owl away off whowhooing about somebody   dead   whippowill   dog crying about somebody   going  die   wind  trying  whisper something  me  i couldnt make out what  was  so  made  cold shivers run over me then away out   woods i heard  kind   sound   ghost makes when  wants  tell about something thats   mind  cant make itself understood  so cant rest easy   grave    go about  way every night grieving i got so downhearted  scared i did wish i had some company pretty soon  spider went crawling up my shoulder  i flipped  off   lit   candle  before i could budge   all shriveled up i didnt need anybody  tell me     awful bad sign  would fetch me some bad luck so i  scared  most shook  clothes off  me i got up  turned around  my tracks three times  crossed my breast every time  then i tied up  little lock  my hair   thread  keep witches away but i hadnt no confidence you do  when youve lost  horseshoe  youve found instead  nailing  up over  door but i hadnt ever heard anybody say   any way  keep off bad luck when youd killed  spider i set down again ashaking all over  got out my pipe   smoke   house  all  still  death now  so  widow wouldnt know well after  long time i heard  clock away off   town go boomboomboomtwelve licks  all still againstiller than ever pretty soon i heard  twig snap down   dark amongst  treessomething   stirring i set still  listened directly i could just barely hear  “meyow meyow” down there that  good says i “meyow meyow”  soft  i could  then i put out  light  scrambled out   window    shed then i slipped down   ground  crawled  among  trees and sure enough there  tom sawyer waiting  me chapter ii we went tiptoeing along  path amongst  trees back towards  end   widows garden stooping down so   branches wouldnt scrape our heads when we  passing   kitchen i fell over  root  made  noise we scrouched down  laid still miss watsons big nigger named jim  setting   kitchen door we could see him pretty clear because there   light behind him he got up  stretched his neck out about  minute listening then  says “who dah” he listened some more then  come tiptoeing down  stood right between us we could  touched him nearly well likely   minutes  minutes  there warnt  sound  we all there so close together there   place  my ankle  got  itching but i dasnt scratch it  then my ear begun  itch  next my back right between my shoulders seemed like id die if i couldnt scratch well ive noticed  thing plenty times since if you    quality or   funeral or trying  go  sleep when you aint sleepyif you  anywheres where  wont do  you  scratch why you  itch all over  upwards   thousand places pretty soon jim says “say who  you whar  you dog my cats ef i didn hear sumfn well i know what is gwyne  do is gwyne  set down here  listen tell i hears  agin” so  set down   ground betwixt me  tom he leaned his back up against  tree  stretched his legs out till one  them most touched one  mine my nose begun  itch it itched till  tears come into my eyes but i dasnt scratch then  begun  itch   inside next i got  itching underneath i didnt know how i  going  set still this miserableness went   much  six or seven minutes but  seemed  sight longer than that i  itching  eleven different places now i reckoned i couldnt stand  moren  minute longer but i set my teeth hard  got ready  try just then jim begun  breathe heavy next  begun  snoreand then i  pretty soon comfortable again tom  made  sign  mekind   little noise  his mouthand we went creeping away  our hands  knees when we  ten foot off tom whispered  me  wanted  tie jim   tree  fun but i said no  might wake  make  disturbance  then theyd find out i warnt in then tom said  hadnt got candles enough   would slip   kitchen  get some more i didnt want him  try i said jim might wake up  come but tom wanted  resk it so we slid  there  got three candles  tom laid five cents   table  pay then we got out  i    sweat  get away but nothing would do tom but  must crawl  where jim was  his hands  knees  play something  him i waited   seemed  good while everything  so still  lonesome as soon  tom  back we cut along  path around  garden fence     fetched up   steep top   hill  other side   house tom said  slipped jims hat off  his head  hung    limb right over him  jim stirred  little but  didnt wake afterwards jim said  witches  witched him  put him   trance  rode him all over  state  then set him under  trees again  hung his hat   limb  show who done it and next time jim told   said they rode him down  new orleans and after that every time  told   spread  more  more till     said they rode him all over  world  tired him most  death  his back  all over saddleboils jim  monstrous proud about it   got so  wouldnt hardly notice  other niggers niggers would come miles  hear jim tell about it    more looked up  than any nigger   country strange niggers would stand  their mouths open  look him all over same  if    wonder niggers  always talking about witches   dark   kitchen fire but whenever one  talking  letting   know all about such things jim would happen   say “hm what you know bout

witches whenever  wanted  just  saying something  it but  never told what    said  it niggers would come  all around there  give jim anything they had just   sight   fivecenter piece but they wouldnt touch it because  devil had had his hands  it jim  most ruined   servant because  got stuck up  account  having seen  devil  been rode  witches well when tom  me got   edge   hilltop we looked away

bushes  tom made everybody swear  keep  secret  then showed them  hole   hill right   thickest part   bushes then we lit  candles  crawled   our hands  knees we went about two hundred yards  then  cave opened up tom poked about amongst  passages  pretty soon ducked under  wall where you wouldnt  noticed  there   hole we went along  narrow place  got into  kind  room all damp  sweaty  cold  there we stopped tom says “now well start this band  robbers  call  tom sawyers gang everybody  wants  join  got  take  oath  write his name  blood” everybody  willing so tom got out  sheet  paper

agreed  get together  fix  day  soon  they could  then we elected tom sawyer first captain  jo harper second captain   gang  so started home i clumb up  shed  crept into my window just before day  breaking my new clothes  all greased up  clayey  i  dogtired chapter iii well i got  good goingover   morning  old miss watson  account  my clothes but  widow she didnt scold but only cleaned off  grease  clay  looked so sorry  i thought i would behave awhile if i could then miss watson she took me   closet  prayed but nothing come  it she told me  pray every day  whatever i asked  i would get it but  warnt so i tried it once i got  fishline but no hooks it warnt any good  me without hooks i tried   hooks three or four times but somehow i couldnt make  work by  by one day i asked miss watson  try  me but she said i   fool she never told me why  i couldnt make  out no way i set down one time back   woods  had  long think about it i says  myself if  body can get anything they pray for why dont deacon winn get back  money  lost  pork why cant  widow get back her silver snuffbox   stole why cant miss watson fat up no says i  my self there aint nothing  it i went  told  widow about it  she said  thing  body could get  praying    “spiritual gifts” this  too many  me but she told me what she meanti must help other people  do everything i could  other people  look out  them all  time  never think about myself this  including miss watson  i took it i went out   woods  turned  over  my mind  long time but i couldnt see no advantage about itexcept   other people so  last i reckoned i wouldnt worry about  any more but just let  go sometimes  widow would take me one side  talk about providence   way  make  bodys mouth water but maybe next day miss watson would take hold  knock  all down again i judged i could see  there  two providences   poor chap would stand considerable show   widows providence but if miss watsons got him there warnt no help  him any more i thought  all out  reckoned i would belong   widows if  wanted me though i couldnt make out how   agoing   any better off then than what   before seeing i  so ignorant  so kind  lowdown  ornery pap  hadnt been seen  more than  year    comfortable  me i didnt want  see him no more he used  always whale me when   sober  could get his hands  me though i used  take   woods most   time when   around well about this time   found   river drownded about twelve mile above town so people said they judged   him anyway said this drownded man  just his size   ragged  had uncommon long hair which  all like pap but they couldnt make nothing out   face because  had been   water so long  warnt much like  face  all they said   floating  his back   water they took him  buried him   bank but i warnt comfortable long because i happened  think  something i knowed mighty well   drownded man dont float  his back but  his face so i knowed then  this warnt pap but  woman dressed up   mans clothes so i  uncomfortable again i judged  old man would turn up again   by though i wished  wouldnt we played robber now  then about  month  then i resigned all  boys did we hadnt robbed nobody hadnt killed any people but only just pretended we used  hop out   woods  go charging down  hogdrivers  women  carts taking garden stuff  market but we never hived any  them tom sawyer called  hogs “ingots”   called  turnips  stuff “julery”  we would go   cave  powwow over what we had done  how many people we had killed  marked but i couldnt see no profit  it one time tom sent  boy  run about town   blazing stick which  called  slogan which   sign   gang  get together  then  said  had got secret news  his spies  next day  whole parcel  spanish merchants  rich arabs  going  camp  cave hollow  two hundred elephants  six hundred camels  over  thousand “sumter” mules all loaded down  dimonds  they didnt have only  guard  four hundred soldiers  so we would lay  ambuscade   called it  kill  lot  scoop  things he said we must slick up our swords  guns  get ready he never could go after even  turnipcart but  must have  swords  guns all scoured up  it though they  only lath  broomsticks  you might scour  them till you rotted  then they warnt worth  mouthful  ashes more than what they  before i didnt believe we could lick such  crowd  spaniards  arabs but i wanted  see  camels  elephants so i   hand next day saturday   ambuscade  when we got  word we rushed out   woods  down  hill but there warnt no spaniards  arabs  there warnt no camels nor no elephants it warnt anything but  sundayschool picnic  only  primerclass  that we busted  up  chased  children up  hollow but we never got anything but some doughnuts  jam though ben rogers got  rag doll  jo harper got  hymnbook   tract  then  teacher charged in  made us drop everything  cut i didnt see no dimonds  i told tom sawyer so he said there  loads  them there anyway   said there  arabs there too  elephants  things i said why couldnt we see them then he said if i warnt so ignorant but had read  book called don quixote i would know without asking he said   all done  enchantment he said there  hundreds  soldiers there  elephants  treasure  so on but we had enemies which  called magicians  they had turned  whole thing into  infant sundayschool just out  spite i said all right then  thing  us  do   go   magicians tom sawyer said i   numskull “why” said he “a magician could call up  lot  genies  they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson they   tall   tree   big around   church” “well” i says “spose we got some genies  help uscant we lick  other crowd then” “how you going  get them” “i dont know how do they get them” “why they rub  old tin lamp or  iron ring  then  genies come tearing in   thunder  lightning aripping around   smoke arolling  everything theyre told  do they up  do it they dont think nothing  pulling  shottower up   roots  belting  sundayschool superintendent over  head  itor any other man” “who makes them tear around so” “why whoever rubs  lamp or  ring they belong  whoever rubs  lamp or  ring  theyve got  do whatever  says if  tells them  build  palace forty miles long out  dimonds  fill  full  chewinggum or whatever you want  fetch  emperors daughter  china  you  marry theyve got  do itand theyve got  do  before sunup next morning too and more theyve got  waltz  palace around over  country wherever you want it you understand” “well” says i “i think they   pack  flatheads  not keeping  palace themselves stead  fooling them away like that and whats moreif i  one  them i would see  man  jericho before i would drop my business  come  him   rubbing   old tin lamp” “how you talk huck finn why youd have  come when  rubbed it whether you wanted  or not” “what  i  high   tree   big   church all right then i would come but i lay id make  man climb  highest tree there    country” “shucks  aint no use  talk  you huck finn you dont seem  know anything somehowperfect saphead” i thought all this over  two or three days  then i reckoned i would see if there  anything  it i got  old tin lamp   iron ring  went out   woods  rubbed  rubbed till i sweat like  injun calculating  build  palace  sell it but  warnt no use none   genies come so then i judged  all  stuff  only just one  tom sawyers lies i reckoned  believed   arabs   elephants but   me i think different it had all  marks   sundayschool chapter iv well three or four months run along    well into  winter now i had been  school most all  time  could spell  read  write just  little  could say  multiplication table up  six times seven  thirtyfive  i dont reckon i could ever get any further than  if i   live forever i dont take no stock  mathematics anyway at first i hated  school but    i got so i could stand it whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey   hiding i got next day done me good  cheered me up so  longer i went  school  easier  got  be i  getting sort  used   widows ways

suitedthis kind  thing  right  his line he got  hanging around  widows too much  so she told him  last  if  didnt quit using around there she would make trouble  him well wasnt  mad he said  would show who  huck finns boss so  watched out  me one day   spring  catched me  took me up  river about three mile   skiff  crossed over   illinois shore where   woody  there warnt no houses but  old log hut   place where  timber  so thick you couldnt find  if you didnt know where  was he kept me  him all  time  i never got  chance  run off we lived   old cabin   always locked  door  put  key under his head nights he had  gun which  had stole i reckon  we fished  hunted    what we lived on every little while  locked me   went down   store three miles   ferry  traded fish  game  whisky  fetched

liked itall but  cowhide part it  kind  lazy  jolly laying off comfortable all day smoking  fishing  no books nor study two months or more run along  my clothes got   all rags  dirt  i didnt see how id ever got  like  so well   widows where you had  wash  eat   plate  comb up  go  bed  get up regular   forever bothering over  book  have old miss watson pecking  you all  time i didnt want  go back no more i had stopped cussing because  widow didnt like it but now i took   again because pap hadnt no objections it  pretty good times up   woods there take  all around but    pap got too handy  his hickry  i couldnt stand it i  all over welts he got  going away so much too  locking me in once  locked me    gone three days it  dreadful lonesome i judged  had got drownded  i wasnt ever going  get out any more i  scared i made up my mind i would fix up some way  leave there i had tried  get out   cabin many  time but i couldnt find no way there warnt  window   big enough   dog  get through i couldnt get up  chimbly   too narrow the door  thick solid oak slabs pap  pretty careful not  leave  knife or anything   cabin when   away i reckon i had hunted  place over  much   hundred times well i  most all  time  it because   about  only way  put   time but this time i found something  last i found  old rusty woodsaw without any handle   laid  between  rafter   clapboards   roof i greased  up  went  work there   old horseblanket nailed against  logs   far end   cabin behind  table  keep  wind  blowing through  chinks  putting  candle out i got under  table  raised  blanket  went  work  saw  section   big bottom log outbig enough  let me through well    good long job but i  getting towards  end   when i heard paps gun   woods i got rid   signs  my work  dropped  blanket  hid my saw  pretty soon pap come in pap warnt   good humorso   his natural self he said   down town  everything  going wrong his lawyer said  reckoned  would win his lawsuit  get  money if they ever got started   trial but then there  ways  put  off  long time  judge thatcher knowed how  do it and  said people allowed thered  another trial  get me away  him  give me   widow  my guardian  they guessed  would win this time this shook me up considerable because i didnt want  go back   widows any more   so cramped up  sivilized  they called it then  old man got  cussing  cussed everything  everybody  could think of  then cussed them all over again  make sure  hadnt skipped any  after   polished off   kind   general cuss all round including  considerable parcel  people which  didnt know  names of  so

across  country mostly night times  hunt  fish  keep alive  so get so far away   old man nor  widow couldnt ever find me any more i judged i would saw out  leave  night if pap got drunk enough  i reckoned  would i got so full   i didnt notice how long i  staying till  old man hollered  asked me whether i  asleep or drownded i got  things all up   cabin  then   about dark while i  cooking

drunks  one delirium tremens that  always his word i judged  would  blind drunk  about  hour  then i would steal  key or saw myself out one or tother he drank  drank  tumbled down  his blankets   by but luck didnt run my way he didnt go sound asleep but  uneasy he groaned  moaned  thrashed around this way     long time at last i got so sleepy i couldnt keep my eyes open all i could do  so before i knowed what i  about i  sound asleep   candle burning i dont know how long i  asleep but all   sudden there   awful scream  i  up there  pap looking wild  skipping around every which way  yelling about snakes he said they  crawling up his legs  then  would give  jump  scream  say one had bit him   cheekbut i couldnt see no snakes he started  run round  round  cabin hollering “take him off take him off hes biting me   neck” i never see  man look so wild   eyes pretty soon   all fagged out  fell down panting then  rolled over  over wonderful fast kicking things every which way  striking  grabbing   air  his hands  screaming  saying there  devils ahold  him he wore out   by  laid still  while moaning then  laid stiller  didnt make  sound i could hear  owls   wolves away off   woods   seemed terrible still he  laying over   corner by    raised up part way  listened  his head  one side he says very low “tramptramptramp thats  dead tramptramptramp theyre coming after me but i wont go oh theyre here dont touch medont hands offtheyre cold let go oh let  poor devil alone” then  went down  all fours  crawled off begging them  let him alone   rolled himself up  his blanket  wallowed  under  old pine table still abegging  then  went  crying i could hear him through  blanket by    rolled out  jumped up  his feet looking wild   see me  went  me he chased me round  round  place   claspknife calling me  angel  death  saying  would kill me  then i couldnt come  him no more i begged  told him i  only huck but  laughed such  screechy laugh  roared  cussed  kept  chasing me up once when i turned short  dodged under his arm  made  grab  got me   jacket between my shoulders  i thought i  gone but i slid out   jacket quick  lightning  saved myself pretty soon   all tired out  dropped down  his back against  door  said  would rest  minute  then kill me he put his knife under him  said  would sleep  get strong  then  would see who  who so  dozed off pretty soon by   i got  old splitbottom chair  clumb up  easy  i could not  make any noise  got down  gun i slipped  ramrod down   make sure   loaded then i laid  across  turnip barrel pointing towards pap  set down behind   wait  him  stir and how slow  still  time did drag along chapter vii “git up what you bout” i opened my eyes  looked around trying  make out where i was it  after sunup  i had been sound asleep pap  standing over me looking sour  sick too he says “what you doin  this gun” i judged  didnt know nothing about what  had been doing so i says “somebody tried  get in so i  laying  him” “why didnt you roust me out” “well i tried to but i couldnt i couldnt budge you” “well all right dont stand there palavering all day but out  you  see if theres  fish   lines  breakfast ill  along   minute” he unlocked  door  i cleared out up  riverbank i noticed some pieces  limbs  such things floating down   sprinkling  bark so i knowed  river had begun  rise i reckoned i would have great times now if i  over   town the june rise used   always luck  me because  soon   rise begins here comes cordwood floating down  pieces  log raftssometimes  dozen logs together so all you have  do   catch them  sell them   woodyards   sawmill i went along up  bank  one eye out  pap  tother one out  what  rise might fetch along well all  once here comes  canoe just  beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long riding high like  duck i shot headfirst off   bank like  frog clothes  all on  struck out   canoe i just expected thered  somebody laying down  it because people often done   fool folks  when  chap had pulled  skiff out most   theyd raise up  laugh  him but  warnt so this time it   driftcanoe sure enough  i clumb   paddled her ashore thinks i  old man   glad when  sees thisshes worth ten dollars but when i got  shore pap wasnt  sight yet   i  running her into  little creek like  gully all hung over  vines  willows i struck another idea i judged id hide her good  then stead  taking   woods when i run off id go down  river about fifty mile  camp  one place  good  not have such  rough time tramping  foot it  pretty close   shanty  i thought i heard  old man coming all  time but i got her hid  then i out  looked around  bunch  willows  there   old man down  path  piece just drawing  bead   bird  his gun so  hadnt seen anything when  got along i  hard   taking up  “trot” line he abused me  little  being so slow but i told him i fell   river    what made me so long i knowed  would see i  wet  then  would  asking questions we got five catfish off  lines  went home while we laid off after breakfast  sleep up both  us being about wore out i got  thinking  if i could fix up some way  keep pap   widow  trying  follow me  would   certainer thing than trusting  luck  get far enough off before they missed me you see all kinds  things might happen well i didnt see no way   while but    pap raised up  minute  drink another barrel  water   says “another time  man comes aprowling round here you roust me out you hear that man warnt here  no good id  shot him next time you roust me out you hear” then  dropped down  went  sleep again but what  had been saying give me  very idea i wanted i says  myself i can fix  now so nobody wont think  following me about twelve oclock we turned out  went along up  bank the river  coming up pretty fast  lots  driftwood going    rise by   along comes part   log raftnine logs fast together we went out   skiff  towed  ashore then we had dinner anybody but pap would  waited  seen  day through so   catch more stuff but  warnt paps style nine logs  enough  one time  must shove right over  town  sell so  locked me   took  skiff  started off towing  raft about halfpast three i judged  wouldnt come back  night i waited till i reckoned

woodpile  i knowed why i  going  leave that i fetched out  gun  now i  done i had wore  ground  good deal crawling out   hole  dragging out so many things so i fixed   good  i could   outside  scattering dust   place which covered up  smoothness   sawdust then i fixed  piece  log back into  place  put two rocks under   one against   hold  there    bent up   place  didnt quite touch ground if you stood four or five foot away  didnt know   sawed you wouldnt never notice it  besides this   back   cabin   warnt likely anybody would go fooling around there it  all grass clear   canoe so i

cooking then i carried  sack about  hundred yards across  grass  through  willows east   house   shallow lake   five mile wide  full  rushesand ducks too you might say   season there   slough or  creek leading out     other side  went miles away i dont know where but  didnt go   river the meal sifted out  made  little track all  way   lake i dropped paps whetstone there too so   look like  had been done  accident then i tied up  rip   meal sack   string so  wouldnt leak no more  took   my saw   canoe again it  about dark now so i dropped  canoe down  river under some willows  hung over  bank  waited   moon  rise i made fast   willow then i took  bite  eat     laid down   canoe  smoke  pipe  lay out  plan i says  myself theyll follow  track   sackful  rocks   shore  then drag  river  me and theyll follow  meal track   lake  go browsing down  creek  leads out    find  robbers  killed me  took  things they wont ever hunt  river  anything but my dead carcass theyll soon get tired  that  wont bother no more about me all right i can stop anywhere i want to jacksons island  good enough  me i know  island pretty well  nobody ever comes there and then i can paddle over  town nights  slink around  pick up things i want jacksons islands  place i  pretty tired   first thing i knowed i  asleep when i woke up i didnt know where i    minute i set up  looked around  little scared then i remembered the river looked miles  miles across the moon  so bright i could  counted  drift logs  went aslipping along black  still hundreds  yards out  shore everything  dead quiet   looked late  smelt late you know what i meani dont know  words  put  in i took  good gap   stretch   just going  unhitch  start when i heard  sound away over  water i listened pretty soon i made  out it   dull kind   regular sound  comes  oars working  rowlocks when its  still night i peeped out through  willow branches  there  wasa skiff away across  water i couldnt tell how many   it it kept acoming  when   abreast  me i see there warnt but one man  it thinks i maybe its pap though i warnt expecting him he dropped below me   current      came aswinging up shore   easy water   went  so close i could  reached out  gun  touched him well  was pap sure enoughand sober too   way  laid his oars i didnt lose no time the next minute i  aspinning down stream soft but quick   shade   bank i made two mile   half  then struck out  quarter   mile or more towards  middle   river because pretty soon i would  passing  ferry landing  people might see me  hail me i got out amongst  driftwood  then laid down   bottom   canoe  let her float i laid there  had  good rest   smoke out  my pipe looking away into  sky not  cloud  it the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down  your back   moonshine i never knowed  before and how far  body can hear   water such nights i heard people talking   ferry landing i heard what they said tooevery word  it one man said   getting towards  long days   short nights now tother one said this warnt one   short ones  reckonedand then they laughed   said  over again  they laughed again then they waked up another fellow  told him  laughed but  didnt laugh  ripped out something brisk  said let him alone the first fellow said  lowed  tell   his old womanshe would think   pretty good but  said  warnt nothing  some things  had said  his time i heard one man say   nearly three oclock   hoped daylight wouldnt wait more than about  week longer after   talk got further  further away  i couldnt make out  words any more but i could hear  mumble  now  then  laugh too but  seemed  long ways off i  away below  ferry now i rose up  there  jacksons island about two mile   half down stream heavy timbered  standing up out   middle   river big  dark  solid like  steamboat without any lights there warnt any signs   bar   headit  all under water now it didnt take me long  get there i shot past  head   ripping rate  current  so swift  then i got into  dead water  landed   side towards  illinois shore i run  canoe into  deep dent   bank  i knowed about i had  part  willow branches  get in  when i made fast nobody could  seen  canoe   outside i went up  set down   log   head   island  looked out   big river   black driftwood  away over   town three mile away where there  three or four lights twinkling a monstrous big lumberraft  about  mile up stream coming along down   lantern   middle  it i watched  come creeping down  when   most abreast  where i stood i heard  man say “stern oars there heave her head  stabboard” i heard  just  plain  if  man   my side there   little gray   sky now so i stepped into  woods  laid down   nap before breakfast chapter viii the sun  up so high when i waked  i judged   after eight oclock i laid there   grass   cool shade thinking about things  feeling rested  ruther comfortable  satisfied i could see  sun out  one or two holes but mostly   big trees all about  gloomy  there amongst them there  freckled places   ground where  light sifted down through  leaves   freckled places swapped about  little showing there   little breeze up there a couple  squirrels set   limb  jabbered  me very friendly i  powerful lazy  comfortabledidnt want  get up  cook breakfast well i  dozing off again when i thinks i hears  deep sound  “boom” away up  river i rouses up  rests  my elbow  listens pretty soon i hears  again i hopped up  went  looked out   hole   leaves  i see  bunch  smoke laying   water  long ways upabout abreast  ferry and there   ferryboat full  people floating along down i knowed what   matter now “boom” i see  white smoke squirt out   ferryboats side you see they  firing cannon over  water trying  make my carcass come   top i  pretty hungry but  warnt going  do  me  start  fire because they might see  smoke so i set there  watched  cannonsmoke  listened   boom the river   mile wide there   always looks pretty   summer morningso i  having  good enough time seeing them hunt  my remainders if i only had  bite  eat well then i happened  think how they always put quicksilver  loaves  bread  float them off because they always go right   drownded carcass  stop there so says i ill keep  lookout  if any  thems floating around after me ill give them  show i changed   illinois edge   island  see what luck i could have  i warnt disappointed a big double loaf come along  i most got    long stick but my foot slipped  she floated out further of course i  where  current set   closest   shorei knowed enough  that but    along comes another one  this time i won i took out  plug  shook out  little dab  quicksilver  set my teeth in it  “bakers bread”what  quality eat none  your lowdown cornpone i got  good place amongst  leaves  set there   log munching  bread  watching  ferryboat  very well satisfied and then something struck me i says now i reckon  widow or  parson or somebody prayed  this bread would find me  here   gone  done it so there aint no doubt but there  something   thingthat is theres something   when  body like  widow or  parson prays but  dont work  me  i reckon  dont work  only just  right kind i lit  pipe  had  good long smoke  went  watching the ferryboat  floating   current  i allowed id have  chance  see who  aboard when she come along because she would come  close where  bread did when shed got pretty well along down towards me i put out my pipe  went  where i fished out  bread  laid down behind  log   bank   little open place where  log forked i could peep through by   she come along  she drifted  so close  they could  run out  plank  walked ashore most everybody    boat pap  judge thatcher  bessie thatcher  jo harper  tom sawyer  his old aunt polly  sid  mary  plenty more everybody  talking about  murder but  captain broke   says “look sharp now  current sets   closest here  maybe hes washed ashore  got tangled amongst  brush   waters edge i hope so anyway” i didnt hope so they all crowded up  leaned over  rails nearly  my face  kept still watching  all their might i could see them firstrate but they couldnt see me then  captain sung out “stand away”   cannon let off such  blast right before me   made me deef   noise  pretty near blind   smoke  i judged i  gone if theyd  had some bullets in i reckon theyd  got  corpse they  after well i see i warnt hurt thanks  goodness the boat floated   went out  sight around  shoulder   island i could hear  booming now  then further  further off    by after  hour i didnt hear  no more the island  three mile long i judged they had got   foot   giving  up but they didnt yet  while they turned around  foot   island  started up  channel   missouri side under steam  booming once   while  they went i crossed over   side  watched them when they got abreast  head   island they quit shooting  dropped over   missouri shore  went home   town i knowed i  all right now nobody else would come ahunting after me i got my traps out   canoe  made me  nice camp   thick woods i made  kind   tent out  my blankets  put my things under so  rain couldnt get  them i catched  catfish  haggled him open  my saw  towards sundown i started my camp fire  had supper then i set out  line  catch some fish  breakfast when   dark i set  my camp fire smoking  feeling pretty well satisfied but     got sort  lonesome  so i went  set   bank  listened   current swashing along  counted  stars  drift logs  rafts  come down  then went  bed there aint no better way  put  time when you  lonesome you cant stay so you soon get over it and so  three days  nights no differencejust  same thing but  next day i went exploring around down through  island i  boss  it  all belonged  me so  say  i wanted  know all about it but mainly i wanted  put   time i found plenty strawberries ripe  prime  green summer grapes  green razberries   green blackberries  just beginning  show they would all come handy   by i judged well i went fooling along   deep woods till i judged i warnt far   foot   island i had my gun along but i hadnt shot nothing    protection thought i would kill some game nigh home about this time i mighty near stepped   goodsized snake   went sliding off through  grass  flowers  i after it trying  get  shot  it i clipped along  all   sudden i bounded right    ashes   camp fire   still smoking my heart jumped up amongst my lungs i never waited   look further but uncocked my gun  went sneaking back  my tiptoes  fast  ever i could every now  then i stopped  second amongst  thick leaves  listened but my breath come so hard i couldnt hear nothing else i slunk along another piece further then listened again  so on  so on if i see  stump i took    man if i trod   stick  broke it  made me feel like  person had cut one  my breaths  two  i only got half   short half too when i got  camp i warnt feeling very brash there warnt much sand  my craw but i says this aint no time   fooling around so i got all my traps into my canoe again so   have them out  sight  i put out  fire  scattered  ashes around  look like  old last years camp  then clumb  tree i reckon i  up   tree two hours but i didnt see nothing i didnt hear nothingi only thought i heard  seen  much   thousand things well i couldnt stay up there forever so  last i got down but i kept   thick woods    lookout all  time all i could get  eat  berries  what  left over  breakfast by  time   night i  pretty hungry so when   good  dark i slid out  shore before moonrise  paddled over   illinois bankabout  quarter   mile i went out   woods  cooked  supper  i had about made up my mind i would stay there all night when i hear  plunketyplunk plunketyplunk  says  myself horses coming  next i hear peoples voices i got everything into  canoe  quick  i could  then went creeping through  woods  see what i could find out i hadnt got far when i hear  man say “we better camp here if we can find  good place  horses  about beat out lets look around” i didnt wait but shoved out  paddled away easy i tied up   old place  reckoned i would sleep   canoe i didnt sleep much i couldnt somehow  thinking and every time i waked up i thought somebody had me   neck so  sleep didnt do me no good by   i says  myself i cant live this way im agoing  find out who   thats here   island  me ill find  out or bust well i felt better right off so i took my paddle  slid out  shore just  step or two  then let  canoe drop along down amongst  shadows the moon  shining  outside   shadows  made  most  light  day i poked along well    hour everything still  rocks  sound asleep well  this time i  most down   foot   island a little ripply cool breeze begun  blow     good  saying  night  about done i give her  turn   paddle  brung her nose  shore then i got my gun  slipped out  into  edge   woods i sat down there   log  looked out through  leaves i see  moon go off watch   darkness begin  blanket  river but   little while i see  pale streak over  treetops  knowed  day  coming so i took my gun  slipped off towards where i had run across  camp fire stopping every minute or two  listen but i hadnt no luck somehow i couldnt seem  find  place but   by sure enough i catched  glimpse  fire away through  trees i went  it cautious  slow by   i  close enough  have  look  there laid  man   ground it most give me  fantods he had  blanket around his head  his head  nearly   fire i set there behind  clump  bushes  about six foot  him  kept my eyes  him steady it  getting gray daylight now pretty soon  gapped  stretched himself  hove off  blanket    miss watsons jim i bet i  glad  see him i says “hello jim”  skipped

soon got  it because  island  only three miles long   quarter   mile wide this place   tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foot high we had  rough time getting   top  sides  so steep   bushes so thick we tramped  clumb around all over it     found  good big cavern   rock most up   top   side towards illinois the cavern   big  two or three rooms bunched together  jim could stand up straight  it it  cool  there jim   putting our traps  there right away but i said we didnt want   climbing up  down there all  time jim said if we had  canoe hid   good place  had all  traps   cavern we could rush there if anybody   come   island  they would never find us without dogs and besides  said them little birds had said   going  rain  did i want  things  get wet so we went back  got

too  i never see  wind blow so it  one  these regular summer storms it would get so dark   looked all blueblack outside  lovely   rain would thrash along  so thick   trees off  little ways looked dim  spiderwebby  here would come  blast  wind  would bend  trees down  turn up  pale underside   leaves  then  perfect ripper   gust would follow along  set  branches  tossing their arms  if they  just wild  next when   just about  bluest  blackestfst    bright  glory  youd have  little glimpse  treetops aplunging about away off yonder   storm hundreds  yards further than you could see before dark  sin again   second  now youd hear  thunder let go   awful crash  then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down  sky towards  under side   world like rolling empty barrels down stairswhere its long stairs  they bounce  good deal you know “jim this  nice” i says “i wouldnt want   nowhere else but here pass me along another hunk  fish  some hot cornbread” “well you wouldnt  ben here f  hadnt  ben  jim

stranger  you couldnt start  face   town  i didnt know now this  lucky because i  weakening i  getting afraid i had come people might know my voice  find me out but if this woman had been  such  little town two days she could tell me all i wanted  know so i knocked   door  made up my mind i wouldnt forget i   girl chapter xi “come in” says  woman  i did she says “take  cheer” i done it she looked me all over  her little shiny eyes  says “what might your name be” “sarah williams” “where bouts do you live in this neighborhood “nom in hookerville seven mile below ive walked all  way  im

yards  then i doubled  my tracks  slipped back  where my canoe was  good piece below  house i jumped in   off   hurry i went upstream far enough  make  head   island  then started across i took off  sunbonnet  i didnt want no blinders  then when i  about  middle i heard  clock begin  strike so i stops  listens  sound come faint over  water but cleareleven when i struck  head   island i never waited  blow though i  most winded but i shoved right into  timber where my old camp used  be  started  good fire there   high  dry spot then i jumped   canoe  dug out  our place  mile   half below  hard  i could go i landed  slopped through  timber  up  ridge  into  cavern there jim laid sound asleep   ground i roused him out  says “git up  hump yourself jim there aint  minute  lose theyre after us” jim never asked no questions  never said  word but  way  worked   next half  hour showed about how   scared by  time everything we had   world   our raft  she  ready   shoved out   willow cove where she  hid we put out  camp fire   cavern  first thing  didnt show  candle outside after that i took  canoe out   shore  little piece  took  look but if there   boat around i couldnt see it  stars  shadows aint good  see by then we got out  raft  slipped along down   shade past  foot   island dead stillnever saying  word chapter xii it must  been close   one oclock when we got below  island  last   raft did seem  go mighty slow if  boat   come along we  going  take   canoe  break   illinois shore    well  boat didnt come  we hadnt ever thought  put  gun   canoe or  fishingline or anything  eat we   ruther too much   sweat  think  so many things it warnt good judgment  put everything   raft if  men went   island i just expect they found  camp fire i built  watched  all night  jim  come anyways they stayed away  us  if my building  fire never fooled them  warnt no fault  mine i played   low down  them  i could when  first streak  day began  show we tied up   towhead   big bend   illinois side  hacked off cottonwood branches   hatchet  covered up  raft  them so she looked like there had been  cavein   bank there a towhead   sandbar   cottonwoods    thick  harrowteeth we had mountains   missouri shore  heavy timber   illinois side   channel  down  missouri shore   place so we warnt afraid  anybody running across us we laid there all day  watched  rafts  steamboats spin down  missouri shore  upbound steamboats fight  big river   middle i told jim all about  time i had jabbering   woman  jim said she   smart one  if she   start after us herself she wouldnt set down  watch  camp fireno sir shed fetch  dog well then i said why couldnt she tell her husband  fetch  dog jim said  bet she did think     time  men  ready  start   believed they must  gone uptown  get  dog  so they lost all  time or else we wouldnt  here   towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below  villageno indeedy we would    same old town again so i said i didnt care what   reason they didnt get us  long  they didnt when   beginning  come  dark we poked our heads out   cottonwood thicket  looked up  down  across nothing  sight so jim took up some   top planks   raft  built  snug wigwam  get under  blazing weather  rainy   keep  things dry jim made  floor   wigwam  raised   foot or more above  level   raft so now  blankets  all  traps  out  reach  steamboat waves right   middle   wigwam we made  layer  dirt about five or six inches deep   frame around    hold    place this   build  fire   sloppy weather or chilly  wigwam would keep   being seen we made  extra steeringoar too because one   others might get broke   snag or something we fixed up  short forked stick  hang  old lantern on because we must always light  lantern whenever we see  steamboat coming downstream  keep  getting run over but we wouldnt have  light   upstream boats unless we see we   what they call  “crossing”   river  pretty high yet very low banks being still  little under water so upbound boats didnt always run  channel but hunted easy water this second night we run between seven  eight hours   current   making over four mile  hour we catched fish  talked  we took  swim now  then  keep off sleepiness it  kind  solemn drifting down  big still river laying  our backs looking up   stars  we didnt ever feel like talking loud   warnt often  we laughedonly  little kind   low chuckle we had mighty good weather   general thing  nothing ever happened  us  allthat night nor  next nor  next every night we passed towns some  them away up  black hillsides nothing but just  shiny bed  lights not  house could you see the fifth night we passed st louis    like  whole world lit up in st petersburg they used  say there  twenty or thirty thousand people  st louis but i never believed  till i see  wonderful spread  lights  two oclock  still night there warnt  sound there everybody  asleep every night now i used  slip ashore towards ten oclock  some little village  buy ten or fifteen cents worth  meal or bacon or other stuff  eat  sometimes i lifted  chicken  warnt roosting comfortable  took him along pap always said take  chicken when you get  chance because if you dont want him yourself you can easy find somebody  does   good deed aint ever forgot i never see pap when  didnt want  chicken himself but   what  used  say anyway mornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields  borrowed  watermelon or  mushmelon or  punkin or some new corn or things   kind pap always said  warnt no harm  borrow things if you  meaning  pay them back some time but  widow said  warnt anything but  soft name  stealing  no decent body would do it jim said  reckoned  widow  partly right  pap  partly right so  best way would   us  pick out two or three things   list  say we wouldnt borrow them any morethen  reckoned  wouldnt  no harm  borrow  others so we talked  over all one night drifting along down  river trying  make up our minds whether  drop  watermelons or  cantelopes or  mushmelons or what but towards daylight we got  all settled satisfactory  concluded  drop crabapples  psimmons we warnt feeling just right before that but   all comfortable now i  glad  way  come out too because crabapples aint ever good   psimmons wouldnt  ripe  two or three months yet we shot  waterfowl now  then  got up too early   morning or didnt go  bed early enough   evening take  all round we lived pretty high the fifth night below st louis we had  big storm after midnight   power  thunder  lightning   rain poured down   solid sheet we stayed   wigwam  let  raft take care  itself when  lightning glared out we could see  big straight river ahead  high rocky bluffs  both sides by   says i “hello jim looky yonder” it   steamboat  had killed herself   rock we  drifting straight down  her the lightning showed her very distinct she  leaning over  part  her upper deck above water  you could see every little chimblyguy clean  clear   chair   big bell   old slouch hat hanging   back  it when  flashes come well  being away   night  stormy  all so mysteriouslike i felt just  way any other boy would  felt when i see  wreck laying there so mournful  lonesome   middle   river i wanted  get aboard  her  slink around  little  see what there  there so i says “les land  her jim” but jim  dead against   first he says “i doan want  go fooln long er no wrack wes doin blame well en we better let blame well alone  de good book says like  not deys  watchman  dat wrack” “watchman your grandmother” i says “there aint nothing  watch but  texas   pilothouse  do you reckon anybodys going  resk his life   texas   pilothouse such  night  this when its likely  break up  wash off down  river any minute” jim couldnt say nothing  that so  didnt try “and besides” i says “we might borrow something worth having out   captains stateroom seegars i bet youand cost five cents apiece solid cash steamboat captains  always rich  get sixty dollars  month  they dont care  cent what  thing costs you know long  they want it stick  candle  your pocket i cant rest jim till we give her  rummaging do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go  this thing not  pie  wouldnt hed call   adventurethats what hed call it  hed land   wreck if   his last act and wouldnt  throw style into itwouldnt  spread himself nor nothing why youd think   christopher clumbus discovering kingdomcome i wish tom sawyer was here” jim  grumbled  little but give in he said we mustnt talk any more than we could help  then talk mighty low the lightning showed us  wreck again just  time  we fetched  stabboard derrick  made fast there the deck  high out here we went sneaking down  slope    labboard   dark towards  texas feeling our way slow  our feet  spreading our hands out  fend off  guys    so dark we couldnt see no sign  them pretty soon we struck  forward end   skylight  clumb   it   next step fetched us  front   captains door which  open   jimminy away down through  texashall we see  light  all   same second we seem  hear low voices  yonder jim whispered  said   feeling powerful sick  told me  come along i says all right   going  start   raft but just then i heard  voice wail out  say “oh please dont boys i swear i wont ever tell” another voice said pretty loud “its  lie jim turner youve acted this way before you always want moren your share   truck  youve always got it too because youve swore t if you didnt youd tell but this time youve said  jest one time too many youre  meanest treacherousest hound  this country” by this time jim  gone   raft i  just abiling  curiosity  i says  myself tom sawyer wouldnt back out now  so i wont either im agoing  see whats going  here so i dropped  my hands  knees   little passage  crept aft   dark till there warnt but one stateroom betwixt me   crosshall   texas then  there i see  man stretched   floor  tied hand  foot  two men standing over him  one  them had  dim lantern  his hand   other one had  pistol this one kept pointing  pistol   mans head   floor  saying “id like to and i orter tooa mean skunk” the man   floor would shrivel up  say “oh please dont bill i haint ever goin  tell” and every time  said   man   lantern would laugh  say “deed you aint you never said no truer thing n that you bet you” and once  said “hear him beg  yit if we hadnt got  best  him  tied him hed  killed us both and what for jist  nothn jist because we stood  our rightsthats what for but i lay you aint agoin  threaten nobody any more jim turner put up  pistol bill” bill says “i dont want to jake packard im  killin himand didnt  kill old hatfield jist  same wayand dont  deserve it” “but i dont want him killed  ive got my reasons  it” “bless yo heart  them words jake packard ill never forgit you longs i live” says  man   floor sort  blubbering packard didnt take no notice  that but hung up his lantern   nail  started towards where i  there   dark  motioned bill  come i crawfished  fast  i could about two yards but  boat slanted so  i couldnt make very good time so  keep  getting run over  catched i crawled into  stateroom   upper side the man came apawing along   dark  when packard got  my stateroom  says “herecome  here” and   come  bill after him but before they got  i  up   upper berth cornered  sorry i come then they stood there  their hands   ledge   berth  talked i couldnt see them but i could tell where they    whisky theyd been having i  glad i didnt drink whisky but  wouldnt made much difference anyway because most   time they couldnt  treed me because i didnt breathe i  too scared and besides  body couldnt breathe  hear such talk they talked low  earnest bill wanted  kill turner he says “hes said hell tell   will if we   give both our shares  him now  wouldnt make no difference after  row   way weve served him shores youre born hell turn states evidence now you hear me im  putting him out  his troubles” “som i” says packard very quiet “blame it id sorter begun  think you wasnt well then thats all right les go  do

well i catched my breath  most fainted shut up   wreck  such  gang  that but  warnt no time   sentimentering wed got  find  boat nowhad  have   ourselves so we went aquaking  shaking down  stabboard side  slow work  was tooseemed  week before we got   stern no sign   boat jim said  didnt believe  could go any furtherso scared  hadnt hardly any strength left  said but i said come on if we get left  this wreck we    fix sure so  we prowled again we struck   stern   texas  found it  then scrabbled along forwards   skylight hanging   shutter  shutter   edge   skylight    water when we got pretty close   crosshall door there   skiff sure enough i could just barely see her i felt ever so thankful in another second i would  been aboard  her but just then  door opened one   men stuck his head out only about  couple  foot  me  i thought i  gone but  jerked   again  says “heave  blame lantern out o sight bill” he flung  bag  something into  boat  then got  himself  set down it  packard then bill he come out  got in packard says   low voice “all readyshove off” i couldnt hardly hang    shutters i  so weak but bill says “hold ond you go through him” “no didnt you” “no so hes got his share o  cash yet” “well then come along no use  take truck  leave money” “say wont  suspicion what were up to” “maybe  wont but we got  have  anyway come along” so they got out  went in the door slammed  because     careened side    half second i    boat  jim come tumbling after me i out  my knife  cut  rope  away we went we didnt touch  oar  we didnt speak nor whisper nor hardly even breathe we went gliding swift along dead silent past  tip   paddlebox  past  stern then   second or two more we   hundred yards below  wreck   darkness soaked her up every last sign  her  we  safe  knowed it when we  three or four hundred yards downstream we see  lantern show like  little spark   texas door   second  we knowed     rascals had missed their boat   beginning  understand  they   just  much trouble now  jim turner was then jim manned  oars  we took out after our raft now   first time  i begun  worry about  meni reckon i hadnt had time  before i begun  think how dreadful  was even  murderers    such  fix i says  myself there aint no telling but i might come    murderer myself yet  then how would i like it so says i  jim “the first light we see well land  hundred yards below  or above it   place where its  good hidingplace  you   skiff  then ill go  fix up some kind   yarn  get somebody  go   gang  get them out  their scrape so they can  hung when their time comes” but  idea   failure  pretty soon  begun  storm again  this time worse than ever the rain poured down  never  light showed everybody  bed i reckon we boomed along down  river watching  lights  watching  our raft after  long time  rain let up but  clouds stayed   lightning kept whimpering      flash showed us  black thing ahead floating  we made  it it   raft  mighty glad  we  get aboard   again we seen  light now away down   right  shore so i said i would go  it the skiff  half full  plunder which  gang had stole there   wreck we hustled     raft   pile  i told jim  float along down  show  light when  judged  had gone about two mile  keep  burning till i come then i manned my oars  shoved   light as i got down towards  three or four more showedup   hillside it   village i closed  above  shore light  laid  my oars  floated as i went  i see    lantern hanging   jackstaff   doublehull ferryboat i skimmed around   watchman awondering whereabouts  slept     i found him roosting   bitts forward  his head down between his knees i gave his shoulder two or three little shoves  begun  cry he stirred up   kind   startlish way but when  see   only me  took  good gap  stretch  then  says “hello whats up dont cry bub

now im agoing up around  corner here  roust out my engineer” i struck   light but  soon   turned  corner i went back  got into my skiff  bailed her out  then pulled up shore   easy water about six hundred yards  tucked myself  among some woodboats  i couldnt rest easy till i could see  ferryboat start but take  all around i  feeling ruther comfortable  accounts  taking all this trouble   gang  not many would  done it i wished  widow knowed about it i judged she would  proud  me  helping these rapscallions because rapscallions  dead beats   kind  widow  good people takes  most interest in well before long here comes  wreck dim  dusky sliding along down a kind  cold shiver went through me  then i struck out  her she  very deep  i see   minute there warnt much chance  anybody being alive  her i pulled all around her  hollered  little but there wasnt any answer all dead still i felt  little bit heavyhearted about  gang but not much  i reckoned if they could stand  i could then here comes  ferryboat so i shoved   middle   river   long downstream slant  when i judged i  out  eyereach i laid  my oars  looked back  see her go  smell around  wreck  miss hookers remainders because  captain would know her uncle hornback would want them  then pretty soon  ferryboat give  up  went   shore  i laid into my work  went abooming down  river it did seem  powerful long time before jims light showed up  when  did show  looked like    thousand mile off by  time i got there  sky  beginning  get  little gray   east so we struck   island  hid  raft  sunk  skiff  turned   slept like dead people chapter xiv by  by when we got up we turned over  truck  gang had stole off   wreck  found boots  blankets  clothes  all sorts  other things   lot  books   spyglass  three boxes  seegars we

cairo   bottom  illinois where  ohio river comes in    what we  after we would sell  raft  get   steamboat  go way up  ohio amongst  free states  then  out  trouble well  second night  fog begun  come on  we made   towhead  tie to   wouldnt do  try  run   fog but when i paddled ahead   canoe   line  make fast there warnt anything but little saplings  tie to i passed  line around one  them right   edge   cut bank but there   stiff current   raft come booming down so lively she tore  out   roots  away she went i see  fog closing down   made me so sick  scared i couldnt budge  most  half  minute  seemed  meand then there warnt no raft  sight you couldnt see twenty yards i jumped into  canoe  run back   stern  grabbed  paddle  set her back  stroke but she didnt come i   such  hurry i hadnt untied her i got up  tried  untie her but i  so excited my hands shook so i couldnt hardly do anything  them as soon  i got started i took out after  raft hot  heavy right down  towhead that  all right  far   went but  towhead warnt sixty yards long   minute i flew   foot   i shot out into  solid white fog  hadnt no more idea which way i  going than  dead man thinks i  wont do  paddle first i know ill run into  bank or  towhead or something i got  set still  float  yet its mighty fidgety business  have  hold your hands still  such  time i whooped  listened away down there somewheres i hears  small whoop  up comes my spirits i went tearing after it listening sharp  hear  again the next time  come i see i warnt heading  it but heading away   right  it and  next time i  heading away   left  itand not gaining   much either  i  flying around this way    tother but   going straight ahead all  time i did wish  fool would think  beat  tin pan  beat  all  time but  never did     still places between  whoops   making  trouble  me well i fought along  directly i hears  whoop behind me i  tangled good now that  somebody elses whoop or else i  turned around i throwed  paddle down i heard  whoop again   behind me yet but   different place  kept coming  kept changing  place  i kept answering till       front  me again  i knowed  current had swung  canoes head downstream  i  all right if   jim  not some other raftsman hollering i couldnt tell nothing about voices   fog  nothing dont look natural nor sound natural   fog the whooping went on   about  minute i come abooming down   cut bank  smoky ghosts  big trees  it   current throwed me off   left  shot by amongst  lot  snags  fairly roared  currrent  tearing  them so swift in another second or two   solid white  still again i set perfectly still then listening  my heart thump  i reckon i didnt draw  breath while  thumped  hundred i just give up then i knowed what  matter was that cut bank   island  jim had gone down tother side  it it warnt no towhead  you could float   ten minutes it had  big timber   regular island  might  five or six miles long  more than half  mile wide i kept quiet  my ears cocked about fifteen minutes i reckon i  floating along  course four or five miles  hour but you dont ever think  that no you feel like you  laying dead still   water  if  little glimpse   snag slips  you dont think  yourself how fast youre going but you catch your breath  think my how  snags tearing along if you think  aint dismal  lonesome out   fog  way  yourself   night you try  onceyoull see next  about  half  hour i whoops now  then  last i hears  answer  long ways off  tries  follow it but i couldnt do it  directly i judged id got into  nest  towheads  i had little dim glimpses  them  both sides  mesometimes just  narrow channel between  some  i couldnt see i knowed  there because id hear  wash   current against  old dead brush  trash  hung over  banks well i warnt long loosing  whoops down amongst  towheads  i only tried  chase them  little while anyway because   worse than chasing  jackolantern you never knowed  sound dodge around so  swap places so quick  so much i had  claw away   bank pretty lively four or five times  keep  knocking  islands out   river  so i judged  raft must  butting into  bank every now  then or else  would get further ahead  clear out  hearingit  floating  little faster than what i was well i seemed     open river again   by but i couldnt hear no sign   whoop nowheres i reckoned jim had fetched up   snag maybe    all up  him i  good  tired so i laid down   canoe  said i wouldnt bother no more i didnt want  go  sleep  course but i  so sleepy i couldnt help it so i thought i would take jest one little catnap but i reckon   more than  catnap  when i waked up  stars  shining bright  fog  all gone  i  spinning down  big bend stern first first i didnt know where i was i thought i  dreaming  when things began  come back  me they seemed  come up dim out  last week it   monstrous big river here   tallest   thickest kind  timber  both banks just  solid wall  well  i could see   stars i looked away downstream  seen  black speck   water i took after it but when i got    warnt nothing but  couple  sawlogs made fast together then i see another speck  chased that then another  this time i  right it   raft when i got   jim  setting there  his head down between his knees asleep  his right arm hanging over  steeringoar the other oar  smashed off   raft  littered up  leaves  branches  dirt so shed had  rough time i made fast  laid down under jims nose   raft  began  gap  stretch my fists out against jim  says “hello jim have i been asleep why didnt you stir me up” “goodness gracious  dat you huck en you ain deadyou ain drowndedyous back agin its too good  true honey its too good  true lemme look  you chile lemme feel o you no you ain dead yous back agin live en soun jis de same ole huckde same ole huck thanks  goodness” “whats  matter  you jim you been adrinking” “drinkin has i ben adrinkin has i had  chance   adrinkin” “well then what makes you talk so wild” “how does i talk wild” “how why haint you been talking about my coming back  all  stuff  if id been gone away” “huckhuck finn you look me  de eye look me  de eye haint you ben gone away” “gone away why what   nation do you mean i haint been gone anywheres where would i go to” “well looky here boss deys sumfn wrong dey is is i me or who is i is i heah or whah is i now dats what i wants  know” “well i think youre here plain enough but i think youre  tangleheaded old fool jim” “i is  i well you answer me dis didnt you tote out de line  de canoe fer  make fas  de towhead” “no i didnt what towhead i haint see no towhead” “you haint seen no towhead looky here didnt de line pull loose en de raf go ahummin down de river en leave you en de canoe behine  de fog” “what fog” “why de fogde fog dats been aroun all night en didnt you whoop en didnt i

now ain dat so bossaint  so you answer me dat” “well this  too many  me jim i haint seen no fog nor no islands nor no troubles nor nothing i been setting here talking  you all night till you went  sleep about ten minutes ago  i reckon i done  same you couldnt  got drunk   time so  course youve been dreaming” “dad fetch it how  i gwyne  dream all dat  ten minutes” “well hang  all you did dream it because there didnt any   happen” “but huck its all jis  plain  me as” “it dont make no difference how plain  is there aint nothing  it i know because ive been here all  time” jim didnt say nothing  about five minutes but set there studying over it then  says “well den i reckn i did dream it huck but dog my cats ef  aint de powerfullest dream i ever see en i haint ever had no dream bfo dats tired me like dis one” “oh well thats all right because  dream does tire  body like everything sometimes but this one   staving dream tell me all about it jim” so jim went  work  told me  whole thing right through just   happened only  painted  up considerable then  said  must start   “terpret” it because   sent   warning he said  first towhead stood   man  would try  do us some good but  current  another man  would get us away  him the whoops  warnings  would come  us every now  then  if we didnt try hard  make out  understand them theyd just take us into bad luck stead  keeping us out  it the lot  towheads  troubles we  going  get into  quarrelsome people  all kinds  mean folks but if we minded our business  didnt talk back  aggravate them we would pull through  get out   fog  into  big clear river which   free states  wouldnt have no more trouble it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got    raft but   clearing up again now “oh well thats all interpreted well enough  far   goes jim” i says “but what does these things stand for” it   leaves  rubbish   raft   smashed oar you could see them firstrate now jim looked   trash  then looked  me  back   trash again he had got  dream fixed so strong  his head   couldnt seem  shake  loose  get  facts back into  place again right away but when  did get  thing straightened around  looked  me steady without ever smiling  says “what do dey stan for ise gwyne  tell you when i got all wore out wid work en wid de callin  you en went  sleep my heart wuz mos broke bekase you wuz los en i didn kyer no mo what become er me en de raf en when i wake up en fine you back agin all safe en soun de tears come en i could  got down  my knees en kiss yo foot is so thankful en all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you could make  fool uv ole jim wid  lie dat truck dah  trash en trash  what people  dat puts dirt  de head er dey frens en makes em ashamed” then  got up slow  walked   wigwam  went  there without saying anything but that but   enough it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot  get him  take  back it  fifteen minutes before i could work myself up  go  humble myself   nigger but i done it  i warnt ever sorry   afterwards neither i didnt do him no more mean tricks  i wouldnt done  one if id  knowed  would make him feel  way chapter xvi we slept most all day  started out  night  little ways behind  monstrous long raft    long going    procession she had four long sweeps  each end so we judged she carried  many  thirty men likely she had five big wigwams aboard wide apart   open camp fire   middle   tall flagpole  each end there   power  style about her it amounted  something being  raftsman  such  craft  that we went drifting down into  big bend   night clouded up  got hot the river  very wide   walled  solid timber  both sides you couldnt see  break   hardly ever or  light we talked about cairo  wondered whether we would know  when we got  it i said likely we wouldnt because i had heard say there warnt but about  dozen houses there  if they didnt happen  have them lit up how  we going  know we  passing  town jim said if  two big rivers joined together there  would show but i said maybe we might think we  passing  foot   island  coming into  same old river again that disturbed jimand me too so  question was what  do i said paddle ashore  first time  light showed  tell them pap  behind coming along   tradingscow    green hand   business  wanted  know how far    cairo jim thought    good idea so we took  smoke    waited there warnt nothing  do now but  look out sharp   town  not pass  without seeing it he said hed  mighty sure  see it because hed   free man  minute  seen it but if  missed  hed    slave country again  no more show  freedom every little while  jumps up  says “dah she is” but  warnt it  jackolanterns or lightning bugs so  set down again  went  watching same  before jim said  made him all over trembly  feverish   so close  freedom well i can tell you  made me all over trembly  feverish too  hear him because i begun  get  through my head   was most freeand who   blame  it why me i couldnt get  out  my conscience no how nor no way it got  troubling me so i couldnt rest i couldnt stay still  one place it hadnt ever come home  me before what this thing   i  doing but now  did   stayed  me  scorched me more  more i tried  make out  myself  i warnt  blame because i didnt run jim off  his rightful owner but  warnt no use conscience up  says every time “but you knowed   running  his freedom  you could  paddled ashore  told somebody” that  soi couldnt get around  noway that  where  pinched conscience says  me “what had poor miss watson done  you  you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes  never say one single word what did  poor old woman do  you  you could treat her so mean why she tried  learn you your book she tried  learn you your manners she tried   good  you every way she knowed how thats what she done” i got  feeling so mean  so miserable i most wished i  dead i fidgeted up  down  raft abusing myself  myself  jim  fidgeting up  down past me we neither  us could keep still every time  danced around  says “dahs cairo”  went through me like  shot  i thought if  was cairo i reckoned i would die  miserableness jim talked out loud all  time while i  talking  myself he  saying how  first thing  would do when  got   free state  would go  saving up money  never spend  single cent  when  got enough  would buy his wife which  owned   farm close  where miss watson lived  then they would both work  buy  two children

clear ohio water inshore sure enough  outside   old regular muddy so   all up  cairo we talked  all over it wouldnt do  take   shore we couldnt take  raft up  stream  course there warnt no way but  wait  dark  start back   canoe  take  chances so we slept all day amongst  cottonwood thicket so    fresh   work  when we went back   raft about dark  canoe  gone we didnt say  word   good while there warnt anything  say we both knowed well enough   some more work   rattlesnakeskin so what   use  talk about it it would only look like we  finding fault   would  bound  fetch more bad luckand keep  fetching it too till we knowed enough  keep still by   we talked about what we better do  found there warnt no way but just  go along down   raft till we got  chance  buy  canoe  go back in we warnt going  borrow  when there warnt anybody around  way pap would do   might set people after us so we shoved out after dark   raft anybody  dont believe yet  its foolishness  handle  snakeskin after all   snakeskin done  us  believe  now if they read   see what more  done  us the place  buy canoes  off  rafts laying up  shore but we didnt see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours  more well  night got gray  ruther thick which   next meanest thing  fog you cant tell  shape   river  you cant see no distance it got   very late  still  then along comes  steamboat up  river we lit  lantern  judged she would see it upstream boats didnt generly come close  us they go out  follow  bars  hunt  easy water under  reefs but nights like this they bull right up  channel against  whole river we could hear her pounding along but we didnt see her good till she  close she aimed right  us often they do   try  see how close they can come without touching sometimes  wheel bites off  sweep  then  pilot sticks his head out  laughs  thinks hes mighty smart well here she comes  we said she  going  try  shave us but she didnt seem   sheering off  bit she   big one  she  coming   hurry too looking like  black cloud  rows  glowworms around it but all   sudden she bulged out big  scary   long row  wideopen furnace doors shining like redhot teeth  her monstrous bows  guards hanging right over us there   yell  us   jingling  bells  stop  engines  powwow  cussing  whistling  steamand  jim went overboard  one side  i   other she come smashing straight through  raft i divedand i aimed  find  bottom too   thirtyfoot wheel had got  go over me  i wanted   have plenty  room i could always stay under water  minute this time i reckon i stayed under  minute   half then i bounced   top   hurry  i  nearly busting i popped out  my armpits  blowed  water out  my nose  puffed  bit of course there   booming current   course  boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them  they never cared much  raftsmen so now she  churning along up  river out  sight   thick weather though i could hear her i sung out  jim about  dozen times but i didnt get any answer so i grabbed  plank  touched me while i  “treading water”  struck out  shore shoving  ahead  me but i made out  see   drift   current  towards  lefthand shore which meant  i    crossing so i changed off  went  way it  one  these long slanting twomile crossings so i   good long time  getting over i made  safe landing  clumb up  bank i couldnt see but  little ways but i went poking along over rough ground   quarter   mile or more  then i run across  big oldfashioned double loghouse before i noticed it i  going  rush   get away but  lot  dogs jumped out  went  howling  barking  me  i knowed better than

away any time amongst them shepherdsons becuz they dont breed any   kind” next sunday we all went  church about three mile everybody ahorseback the men took their guns along so did buck  kept them between their knees or stood them handy against  wall the shepherdsons done  same it  pretty ornery preachingall about brotherly love  suchlike tiresomeness but everybody said    good sermon  they all talked  over going home  had such  powerful lot  say about faith  good works  free grace  preforeordestination  i dont know what all   did seem  me   one   roughest sundays i had run across yet about  hour after dinner everybody  dozing around some  their chairs  some  their rooms   got   pretty dull buck   dog  stretched out   grass   sun sound asleep i went up  our room  judged i would take  nap myself i found  sweet miss sophia standing  her door which  next  ours  she took me  her room  shut  door very soft  asked me if i liked her  i said i did  she asked me if i would do something  her

could put by   i begin  hear guns  good ways off when i come  sight   log store   woodpile where  steamboats lands i worked along under  trees  brush till i got   good place  then i clumb up into  forks   cottonwood   out  reach  watched there   woodrank four foot high  little ways  front   tree  first i  going  hide behind that but maybe   luckier i didnt there  four or five men cavorting around  their horses   open place before  log store cussing  yelling  trying  get   couple  young chaps   behind  woodrank alongside   steamboat landing but they couldnt come it every time one  them showed himself   river side   woodpile  got shot at the two boys  squatting back  back behind  pile so they could watch both ways by    men stopped cavorting around  yelling they started riding towards  store then up gets one   boys draws  steady bead over  woodrank  drops one  them out  his saddle all  men jumped off  their horses  grabbed  hurt one  started  carry him   store   minute  two boys started   run they got half way   tree i   before  men noticed then  men see them  jumped  their horses  took out after them they gained   boys but  didnt do no good  boys had too good  start they got   woodpile    front  my tree  slipped  behind it  so they had  bulge   men again one   boys  buck   other   slim young chap about nineteen years old the men ripped around awhile  then rode away as soon  they  out  sight i sung out  buck  told him he didnt know what  make  my voice coming out   tree  first he  awful surprised he told me  watch out sharp  let him know when  men come  sight again said they  up  some devilment or otherwouldnt  gone long i wished i  out   tree but i dasnt come down buck begun  cry  rip  lowed  him  his cousin joe that   other young chap would make up  this day yet he said his father  his two brothers  killed  two or three   enemy said  shepherdsons laid  them  ambush buck said his father  brothers ought  waited  their relationsthe shepherdsons  too strong  them i asked him what  become  young harney  miss sophia he said theyd got across  river   safe i  glad  that but  way buck did take  because  didnt manage  kill harney  day  shot  himi haint ever heard anything like it all   sudden bang bang bang goes three or four gunsthe men had slipped around through  woods  come   behind without their horses the boys jumped   riverboth  them hurtand  they swum down  current  men run along  bank shooting  them  singing out “kill them kill them” it made me so sick i most fell out   tree i aint agoing  tell all  happenedit would make me sick again if i   do that i wished i hadnt ever come ashore  night  see such things i aint ever going  get shut  themlots  times i dream about them i stayed   tree till  begun  get dark afraid  come down sometimes i heard guns away off   woods  twice i seen little gangs  men gallop past  log store  guns so i reckoned  trouble  still agoing on i  mighty downhearted so i made up my mind i wouldnt ever go anear  house again because i reckoned i   blame somehow i judged   piece  paper meant  miss sophia   meet harney somewheres  halfpast two  run off  i judged i ought  told her father about  paper   curious way she acted  then maybe  would  locked her up  this awful mess wouldnt ever happened when i got down out   tree i crept along down  river bank  piece  found  two bodies laying   edge   water  tugged  them till i got them ashore then i covered up their faces  got away  quick  i could i cried  little when i  covering up bucks face    mighty good  me it  just dark now i never went near  house but struck through  woods  made   swamp jim warnt  his island so i tramped off   hurry   crick  crowded through  willows redhot  jump aboard  get out   awful country the raft  gone my souls but i  scared i couldnt get my breath  most  minute then i raised  yell a voice not twentyfive foot  me says “good lan  dat you honey doan make no noise” it  jims voicenothing ever sounded so good before i run along  bank  piece  got aboard  jim  grabbed me  hugged me   so glad  see me he says “laws bless you chile i uz right down sho yous dead agin jacks been heah  say  reckn yous ben shot kase you

no time jim but just shove off   big water  fast  ever you can” i never felt easy till  raft  two mile below there  out   middle   mississippi then we hung up our signal lantern  judged  we  free  safe once more i hadnt had  bite  eat since yesterday so jim  got out some corndodgers  buttermilk  pork  cabbage  greensthere aint nothing   world so good when its cooked rightand whilst i eat my supper we talked  had  good time i  powerful glad  get away   feuds  so  jim  get away   swamp we said there warnt no home like  raft after all other places do seem so cramped up  smothery but  raft dont you feel mighty free  easy  comfortable   raft chapter xix two or three days  nights went by i reckon i might say they swum by they slid along so quiet  smooth  lovely here   way we put   time it   monstrous big river down theresometimes  mile   half wide we run nights  laid up  hid daytimes soon  night  most gone we stopped navigating  tied upnearly always   dead water under  towhead  then cut young cottonwoods  willows  hid  raft  them then we set out  lines next we slid into  river  had  swim so   freshen up  cool off then we set down   sandy bottom where  water  about knee deep  watched  daylight come not  sound anywheresperfectly stilljust like  whole world  asleep only sometimes  bullfrogs acluttering maybe the first thing  see looking away over  water   kind  dull linethat   woods  tother side you couldnt make nothing else out then  pale place   sky then more paleness spreading around then  river softened up away off  warnt black any more but gray you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far awaytrading scows  such things  long black streaksrafts sometimes you could hear  sweep screaking or jumbled up voices   so still  sounds come so far     you could see  streak   water which you know   look   streak  theres  snag there   swift current which breaks    makes  streak look  way  you see  mist curl up off   water   east reddens up   river  you make out  logcabin   edge   woods away   bank  tother side   river being  woodyard likely  piled  them cheats so you can throw  dog through  anywheres then  nice breeze springs up  comes fanning you  over there so cool  fresh  sweet  smell  account   woods   flowers but sometimes not  way because theyve left dead fish laying around gars  such  they do get pretty rank  next youve got  full day  everything smiling   sun   songbirds just going it a little smoke couldnt  noticed now so we would take some fish off   lines  cook up  hot breakfast and afterwards we would watch  lonesomeness   river  kind  lazy along     lazy off  sleep wake up   by  look  see what done it  maybe see  steamboat coughing along upstream so far off towards  other side you couldnt tell nothing about her only whether she   sternwheel or sidewheel then  about  hour there wouldnt  nothing  hear nor nothing  seejust solid lonesomeness next youd see  raft sliding by away off yonder  maybe  galoot   chopping because theyre most always doing    raft youd see  axe flash  come downyou dont hear nothing you see  axe go up again    time its above  mans head then you hear  kchunkit had took all  time  come over  water so we would put   day lazying around listening   stillness once there   thick fog   rafts  things  went   beating tin pans so  steamboats wouldnt run over them a scow or  raft went  so close we could hear them talking  cussing  laughingheard them plain but we couldnt see no sign  them  made you feel crawly   like spirits carrying   way   air jim said  believed   spirits but i says “no spirits wouldnt say dern  dern fog” soon    night out we shoved when we got her out  about  middle we let her alone  let her float wherever  current wanted her to then we lit  pipes  dangled our legs   water  talked about all kinds  thingswe  always naked day  night whenever  mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes bucks folks made  me  too good   comfortable  besides i didnt go much  clothes nohow sometimes wed have  whole river all  ourselves   longest time yonder   banks   islands across  water  maybe  sparkwhich   candle   cabin window  sometimes   water you could see  spark or twoon  raft or  scow you know  maybe you could hear  fiddle or  song coming over  one  them crafts its lovely  live   raft we had  sky up there all speckled  stars  we used  lay  our backs  look up  them  discuss about whether they  made or only just happened jim  allowed they  made but i allowed they happened i judged  would have took too long  make so many jim said  moon could  laid them well  looked kind  reasonable so i didnt say nothing against it because ive seen  frog lay most  many so  course  could  done we used  watch  stars  fell too  see them streak down jim allowed theyd got spoiled   hove out   nest once or twice   night we would see  steamboat slipping along   dark  now  then she would belch  whole world  sparks up out  her chimbleys  they would rain down   river  look awful pretty then she would turn  corner  her lights would wink out  her powwow shut off  leave  river still again     her waves would get  us  long time after she  gone  joggle  raft  bit  after  you wouldnt hear nothing  you couldnt tell how long except maybe frogs or something after midnight  people  shore went  bed  then  two or three hours  shores  blackno more sparks   cabin windows these sparks  our clockthe first one  showed again meant morning  coming so we hunted  place  hide  tie up right away one morning about daybreak i found  canoe  crossed over  chute   main shoreit  only two hundred yardsand paddled about  mile up  crick amongst  cypress woods  see if i couldnt get some berries just  i  passing  place where  kind   cowpath crossed  crick here comes  couple  men tearing up  path  tight  they could foot it i thought i   goner  whenever anybody  after anybody i judged   meor maybe jim i  about  dig out  there   hurry but they  pretty close  me then  sung out  begged me  save their livessaid they hadnt been doing nothing   being chased  itsaid there  men  dogs acoming they wanted  jump right in but i says “dont you do it i dont hear  dogs  horses yet youve got time  crowd through  brush  get up  crick  little ways then you take   water  wade down  me  get inthatll throw  dogs off  scent” they done it  soon  they  aboard i lit out  our towhead   about five or ten minutes we heard  dogs   men away off shouting we heard them come along towards  crick but couldnt see them they seemed  stop  fool around  while then  we got further  further away all  time we couldnt hardly hear them  all   time we had left  mile  woods behind us  struck  river everything  quiet  we paddled over   towhead  hid   cottonwoods   safe one  these fellows  about seventy or upwards  had  bald head  very gray whiskers he had  old batteredup slouch hat on   greasy blue woollen shirt  ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boottops  homeknit gallusesno  only had

we all laid off  talked   first thing  come out   these chaps didnt know one another “what got you into trouble” says  baldhead  tother chap “well id been selling  article  take  tartar off  teethand

leading such  life   degraded down into such company” and  begun  wipe  corner  his eye   rag “dern your skin aint  company good enough  you” says  baldhead pretty pert  uppish “yes  is good enough  me its  good  i deserve  who fetched me so low when i  so high i did myself i dont blame you gentlemenfar  it i dont blame anybody i deserve  all let  cold world do  worst one thing i knowtheres  grave somewhere  me the world may go  just  its always done  take everything  meloved ones property everything but  cant take that some day ill lie down    forget  all  my poor broken heart    rest” he went  awiping “drot your pore broken heart” says  baldhead “what  you heaving your pore broken heart  us fr we haint done nothing” “no i know you havent i aint blaming you gentlemen i brought

passtis no matter the secret  my birth” “the secret  your birth do you mean  say” “gentlemen” says  young man very solemn “i  reveal   you  i feel i may have confidence  you by rights i am  duke” jims eyes bugged out when  heard that  i reckon mine did too then  baldhead says “no you cant mean it” “yes my greatgrandfather eldest son   duke  bridgewater fled  this country about  end   last century  breathe  pure air  freedom married here  died leaving  son his own father dying about  same time the second son   late duke seized  titles  estatesthe infant real duke  ignored i am  lineal descendant   infanti am  rightful duke  bridgewater  here am i forlorn torn  my high estate hunted  men despised   cold world ragged worn heartbroken  degraded   companionship  felons   raft” jim pitied him ever so much  so did i we tried  comfort him but  said  warnt much use  couldnt  much comforted said if we   mind  acknowledge him  would do him more good than most anything else so we said we would if  would tell us how he said we ought  bow when we spoke  him  say “your grace” or “my lord” or “your lordship”and  wouldnt mind  if we called him plain “bridgewater” which  said   title anyway  not  name  one  us ought  wait  him  dinner  do any little thing  him  wanted done well   all easy so we done it all through dinner jim stood around  waited  him  says “will yo grace have some o dis or some o dat”  so on   body could see   mighty pleasing  him but  old man got pretty silent   bydidnt have much  say  didnt look pretty comfortable over all  petting   going  around  duke he seemed  have something  his mind so along   afternoon  says “looky here bilgewater”  says “im nation sorry  you but you aint  only person thats had troubles like that” “no” “no you aint you aint  only person thats ben snaked down wrongfully outn  high place” “alas” “no you aint  only person thats had  secret  his birth” and  jings he begins  cry “hold what do you mean” “bilgewater kin i trust you” says  old man still sort  sobbing “to  bitter death” he took  old man   hand  squeezed it  says “that secret  your being speak” “bilgewater i am  late dauphin” you bet you jim  me stared this time then  duke says “you  what” “yes my friend   too trueyour eyes  lookin  this very moment   pore disappeared dauphin looy  seventeen son  looy  sixteen  marry antonette” “you at your age no you mean youre  late charlemagne you must  six or seven hundred years old   very least” “trouble  done it bilgewater trouble  done it trouble  brung these gray hairs  this premature balditude yes gentlemen you see before you  blue jeans  misery  wanderin exiled trampledon  sufferin rightful king  france” well  cried  took  so  me  jim didnt know hardly what  do we  so sorryand so glad  proud wed got him  us too so we set in like we done before   duke  tried  comfort him but  said  warnt no use nothing but   dead  done   all could do him any good though  said  often made him feel easier  better   while if people treated him according  his rights  got down  one knee  speak  him  always called him “your majesty”  waited  him first  meals  didnt set down  his presence till  asked them so jim  me set  majestying him  doing this    tother  him  standing up till  told us we might set down this done him heaps  good  so  got cheerful  comfortable but  duke kind  soured  him  didnt look  bit satisfied   way things  going still  king acted real friendly towards him  said  dukes greatgrandfather  all  other dukes  bilgewater   good deal thought   his father   allowed  come   palace considerable but  duke stayed huffy  good while till     king says “like  not we got   together  blamed long time  this hyer raft bilgewater  so whats  use o your bein sour it ll only make things oncomfortable it aint

easy lifecome give us your hand duke  les all  friends” the duke done it  jim  me  pretty glad  see it it took away all  uncomfortableness  we felt mighty good over it because  would  been  miserable business  have any unfriendliness   raft  what you want above all things   raft   everybody   satisfied  feel right  kind towards  others it didnt take me long  make up my mind  these liars warnt no

chapter xxi it  after sunup now but we went right   didnt tie up the king   duke turned out    looking pretty rusty but after theyd jumped overboard  took  swim  chippered them up  good deal after breakfast  king  took  seat   corner   raft  pulled off his boots  rolled up his britches  let his legs dangle   water so    comfortable  lit his pipe  went  getting his romeo  juliet  heart when  had got  pretty good him   duke begun  practice  together the duke had  learn him over  over again how  say every speech   made him sigh  put his hand  his heart  after  while  said  done  pretty well “only”  says “you mustnt bellow out romeo  way like  bullyou must say  soft  sick  languishy soroomeo    idea  juliets  dear sweet mere child   girl you know  she doesnt bray like  jackass” well next they got out  couple  long swords   duke made out  oak laths  begun  practice  sword fightthe duke called himself richard iii   way they laid   pranced around  raft  grand  see but     king tripped  fell overboard  after  they took  rest  had  talk about all kinds  adventures theyd had  other times along  river after dinner  duke says “well capet well want  make this  firstclass show you know so

lucky there  going    circus there  afternoon   country people  already beginning  come in  all kinds  old shackly wagons   horses the circus would leave before night so our show would have  pretty

painted they  set up three or four foot above ground  stilts so    out  reach   water when  river  overflowed the houses had little gardens around them but they didnt seem  raise hardly anything  them but jimpson weeds  sunflowers  ashpiles  old curledup boots  shoes  pieces  bottles  rags  playedout tinware the fences  made  different kinds  boards nailed   different times  they leaned every whichway  had gates  didnt generly have but one hingea leather one some   fences had been whitewashed some time or another but  duke said    clumbuss time like enough there  generly hogs   garden  people driving them out all  stores  along one street they had white domestic awnings  front   country people hitched their horses   awningposts there  empty drygoods boxes under  awnings  loafers roosting  them all day long whittling them  their barlow knives  chawing tobacco  gaping  yawning  stretchinga mighty ornery lot they generly had  yellow straw hats most  wide   umbrella but didnt wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another bill  buck  hank  joe  andy  talked lazy  drawly  used considerable many cuss words there   many  one loafer leaning up against every awningpost   most always had his hands  his britchespockets except when  fetched them out  lend  chaw  tobacco or scratch what  body  hearing amongst them all  time was “gimme  chaw v tobacker hank” “caint i haint got but one chaw left ask bill” maybe bill  gives him  chaw maybe  lies  says  aint got none some  them kinds  loafers never   cent   world nor  chaw  tobacco  their own they get all their chawing  borrowing they say   fellow “i wisht youd len me  chaw jack i jist this minute give ben thompson  last chaw i had”which   lie pretty much everytime  dont fool nobody but  stranger but jack aint no stranger so  says “you give him  chaw did you so did your sisters cats grandmother you pay me back  chaws youve awready borryd offn me lafe buckner then ill loan you one or two ton  it  wont charge

chaws  natural leaf twisted when they borrow  chaw they dont generly cut  off   knife but set  plug  between their teeth  gnaw  their teeth  tug   plug  their hands till they get   two then sometimes  one  owns  tobacco looks mournful   when its handed back  says sarcastic “here gimme  chaw  you take  plug” all  streets  lanes  just mud they warnt nothing else but mudmud  black  tar  nigh about  foot deep  some places  two or three inches deep  all  places the hogs loafed  grunted around everywheres youd see  muddy sow   litter  pigs come lazying along  street  whollop herself right down   way where folks had  walk around her  shed stretch out  shut her eyes  wave her ears whilst  pigs  milking her  look  happy  if she   salary and pretty soon youd hear  loafer sing out “hi so boy sick him tige”  away  sow would go squealing most horrible   dog or two swinging  each ear  three or four dozen more acoming  then you would see all  loafers get up  watch  thing out  sight  laugh   fun  look grateful   noise then theyd settle back again till there   dog fight there couldnt anything wake them up all over  make them happy all over like  dog fightunless  might  putting turpentine   stray dog  setting fire  him or tying  tin pan  his tail  see him run himself  death on  river front some   houses  sticking out over  bank  they  bowed  bent  about ready  tumble in the people had

useup  street  would tear again  give sherburn another cussing by   somebody says “go  his daughterquick go  his daughter sometimes hell listen  her if anybody can persuade him she can” so somebody started   run i walked down street  ways  stopped in about five or ten minutes here comes boggs again but not  his horse he  areeling across  street towards me bareheaded   friend  both sides  him aholt  his arms  hurrying him along he  quiet  looked uneasy   warnt hanging back any but  doing some   hurrying himself somebody sings out “boggs” i looked over there  see who said it     colonel

maybe there  going   trouble the streets  full  everybody  excited everybody  seen  shooting  telling how  happened  there   big crowd packed around each one  these fellows stretching their necks  listening one long lanky man  long hair   big white fur stovepipe hat   back  his head   crookedhandled cane marked out  places   ground where boggs stood  where sherburn stood   people following him around  one place  tother  watching everything  done  bobbing their heads  show they understood  stooping  little  resting their hands  their thighs  watch him mark  places   ground  his cane  then  stood up straight  stiff where sherburn had stood frowning  having his hatbrim down over his eyes  sung out “boggs”  then fetched his cane down slow   level  says “bang” staggered backwards says “bang” again  fell down flat  his back the people  had seen  thing said  done  perfect said   just exactly  way  all happened then  much   dozen people got out their bottles  treated him well

across his left arm  cocking  when  says this the crowd washed back sudden  then broke all apart  went tearing off every which way  buck harkness  heeled  after them looking tolerable cheap i could  stayed if i wanted to but i didnt want to i went   circus  loafed around  back side till  watchman went by  then dived  under  tent i had my twentydollar gold piece  some other money but i reckoned i better save it because there aint no telling how soon you  going  need it away  home  amongst strangers  way you cant  too careful i aint opposed  spending money  circuses when there aint no other way

centerpole cracking his whip  shouting “hihi”   clown cracking jokes behind him     all hands dropped  reins  every lady put her knuckles  her hips  every gentleman folded his arms  then how  horses did lean over  hump themselves and so one after  other they all skipped off into  ring  made  sweetest bow i ever see  then scampered out  everybody clapped their hands  went just about wild well all through  circus they done  most astonishing things  all  time  clown carried  so  most killed  people the ringmaster couldnt ever say  word  him but   back  him quick   wink   funniest things  body

so  stirred up  people   lot  men begun  pile down off   benches  swarm towards  ring saying “knock him down throw him out”  one or two women begun  scream so then  ringmaster  made  little speech  said  hoped there wouldnt  no disturbance  if  man would promise  wouldnt make no more trouble  would let him ride if  thought  could stay   horse so everybody laughed  said all right   man got on the

little willow towhead out   middle where there   village  each side   river   duke   king begun  lay out  plan  working them towns jim  spoke   duke  said  hoped  wouldnt take but  few hours because  got mighty heavy  tiresome  him when  had  lay all day   wigwam tied   rope you see when we left him all alone we had  tie him because if anybody happened   him all  himself  not tied  wouldnt look much like    runaway nigger you know so  duke said  was kind  hard  have  lay roped all day  hed cipher out some way  get around it he  uncommon bright  duke was   soon struck it he dressed jim up  king lears outfitit   long curtaincalico gown   white horsehair wig  whiskers  then  took his theater paint  painted jims face  hands  ears  neck all over  dead dull solid blue like  man thats been drownded nine days blamed if  warnt  horriblest looking outrage i ever see then  duke took  wrote out  sign   shingle so sick arabbut harmless when not out  his head and  nailed  shingle   lath  stood  lath up four or five foot  front   wigwam jim  satisfied he said    sight better than lying tied  couple  years every day  trembling all over every time there   sound the duke told him  make himself free  easy  if anybody ever come meddling around  must hop out   wigwam  carry   little  fetch  howl or two like  wild beast   reckoned they would light out  leave him alone which  sound enough judgment but you take  average man   wouldnt wait  him  howl why  didnt only look like   dead  looked considerable more than that these rapscallions wanted  try  nonesuch again because there  so much money  it but they judged  wouldnt  safe because maybe  news might  worked along down  this time they couldnt hit no project  suited exactly so  last  duke said  reckoned hed lay off  work his brains  hour or two  see if  couldnt put up something   arkansaw village   king  allowed  would drop over  tother village without any plan but just trust  providence  lead him  profitable waymeaning  devil i reckon we had all bought store clothes where we stopped last  now  king put hisn on   told me  put mine on i done it  course the kings duds  all black   did look real swell  starchy i never knowed how clothes could change  body before why before  looked like  orneriest old rip  ever was but now when hed take off his new white beaver  make  bow  do  smile  looked  grand  good  pious  youd say  had walked right out   ark  maybe  old leviticus himself jim cleaned up  canoe  i got my paddle ready there   big steamboat laying   shore away up under  point about three mile above  townbeen there  couple  hours taking  freight says  king “seein how im dressed i reckon maybe i better arrive down  st louis or cincinnati or some other big place go   steamboat huckleberry well come down   village  her” i didnt have   ordered twice  go  take  steamboat ride i fetched  shore  half  mile above  village  then went scooting along  bluff bank   easy water pretty soon we come   nice innocentlooking young country jake setting   log swabbing  sweat off  his face    powerful warm weather   had  couple  big carpetbags  him “run her nose  shore” says  king i done it “wher you bound for young man” “for  steamboat going  orleans” “git aboard” says  king “hold   minute my servant ll hep you  them bags jump out  hep  gentleman adolphus”meaning me i see i done so  then we all three started  again the young chap  mighty thankful said   tough work toting his baggage such weather he asked  king where   going   king told him hed come down  river  landed   other village this morning  now   going up  few mile  see  old friend   farm up there the young fellow says “when i first see you i says  myself its mr wilks sure   come mighty near getting here  time but then i says again no i reckon  aint

  sorry  mr wilks  not arriving  time all  same if hes missed anything  itwhich i hope  hasnt” “well  dont miss any property  it because hell get  all right but hes missed seeing his brother peter

peters businesswhich   tanner  about georgeswhich   carpenter  about harveyswhich   dissentering minister  so on  so on then  says “what did you want  walk all  way up   steamboat for” “because shes

terrible sad but weve all got  go one time or another so what we want  do    prepared then were all right” “yes sir its  best way ma used  always say that” when we struck  boat she  about done loading  pretty soon she got off the king never said nothing about going aboard so i lost my ride after all when  boat  gone  king made me paddle up another mile   lonesome place  then  got ashore  says “now hustle back right off  fetch  duke up here   new carpetbags and if hes gone over  tother side go over there  git him and tell him  git himself up regardless shove along now” i see what he  up to but i never said nothing  course when i got back   duke we hid  canoe  then they set down   log   king told him everything just like  young fellow had said itevery last word  it and all  time   adoing   tried  talk like  englishman   done  pretty well too   slouch i cant imitate him  so i aint agoing  try to but  really done  pretty good then  says “how  you   deef  dumb bilgewater” the duke said leave him alone  that said  had played  deef  dumb person   histronic boards so then they waited   steamboat about  middle   afternoon  couple  little boats come along but they didnt come  high enough up  river but  last there   big one  they hailed her she sent out her yawl  we went aboard  she   cincinnati  when they found we only wanted  go four or five mile they  booming mad  gave us  cussing  said they wouldnt land us but  king  cam he says “if gentlemen kin afford  pay  dollar  mile apiece   took   put off   yawl  steamboat kin afford  carry em cant it” so they softened down  said   all right  when we got   village they yawled us ashore about two dozen men flocked down when they see  yawl acoming  when  king says “kin any  you gentlemen tell me wher mr peter wilks lives” they give  glance  one another  nodded their heads  much   say “what d i tell you” then one  them says kind  soft  gentle “im sorry sir but  best we can do   tell you where  did live yesterday evening” sudden  winking  ornery old cretur went   smash  fell up against  man  put his chin  his shoulder  cried down his back  says “alas alas our poor brothergone  we never got  see him oh its too too hard” then  turns around blubbering  makes  lot  idiotic signs   duke  his hands  blamed if  didnt drop  carpetbag  bust out acrying if they warnt  beatenest lot them two frauds  ever i struck well  men gathered

the thing   you  treat him kind  not  saying things  make him remember  aint  his own country  amongst his own folks” i says  myself this   girl  im letting  old reptile rob her  her money then susan she waltzed in  if youll believe me she did give harelip hark   tomb says i  myself  this  another one  im letting him rob her  her money then mary jane she took another inning  went  sweet  lovely againwhich  her way but when she got done there warnt hardly anything left o poor harelip so she hollered “all right then” says  other girls “you just ask his pardon” she done it too  she done  beautiful she done  so beautiful   good  hear  i wished i could tell her  thousand lies so she could do  again i says  myself this  another one  im letting him rob her  her money and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out  make me feel  home  know i  amongst friends i felt so ornery  low down  mean  i says  myself my minds made up ill hive  money  them or bust so then i lit outfor bed i said meaning some time or another when i got  myself i went  thinking  thing over i says  myself shall i go   doctor private  blow  these frauds nothat wont do he might tell who told him then  king   duke would make  warm  me shall i go private  tell mary jane noi dasnt do it her face would give them  hint sure theyve got  money  theyd slide right out  get away  it if she   fetch  help id get mixed up   business before   done with i judge no there aint no good way but one i got  steal  money somehow  i got  steal  some way  they wont suspicion  i done it theyve got  good thing here  they aint agoing  leave till theyve played this family  this town  all theyre worth so ill find  chance time enough ill steal   hide it    by when im away down  river ill write  letter  tell mary jane where its hid but i better hive  tonight if i can because  doctor maybe hasnt let up  much   lets   has  might scare them out  here yet so thinks i ill go  search them rooms upstairs  hall  dark but i found  dukes room  started  paw around   my hands but i recollected  wouldnt  much like  king  let anybody else take care   money but his own self so then i went  his room  begun  paw around there but i see i couldnt do nothing without  candle  i dasnt light one  course so i judged id got  do  other thinglay  them  eavesdrop about  time i hears their footsteps coming   going  skip under  bed i reached  it but  wasnt where i thought  would be but i touched  curtain  hid mary janes frocks so i jumped  behind   snuggled  amongst  gowns  stood there perfectly still they come   shut  door   first thing  duke done   get down  look under  bed then i  glad i hadnt found  bed when i wanted it and yet you know its kind  natural  hide under  bed when you  up  anything private they sets down then   king says “well what  it and cut  middlin short because its better  us   down there awhoopin up  mournin than up here givin em  chance  talk us over” “well this  it capet i aint easy i aint comfortable that doctor lays  my mind i wanted  know your plans ive got  notion  i think its  sound one” “what  it duke” “that we better glide out  this before three   morning  clip  down  river  what weve got specially seeing we got  so easygiven back  us flung  our heads  you may say when  course we allowed  have  steal  back im  knocking off  lighting out” that made me feel pretty bad about  hour or two ago  would  been  little different but now  made me feel bad  disappointed the king rips out  says “what and not sell out  rest o  property march off like  passel  fools  leave eight or nine thousn dollars worth o property layin around jest sufferin   scooped inand all good salable stuff too” the duke  grumbled said  bag  gold  enough   didnt want  go no deeperdidnt want  rob  lot  orphans  everything they had “why how you talk” says  king “we shant rob em  nothing  all but jest this money the people  buys  property   suffrers because  soon s its found out at we didnt own itwhich wont  long after weve slidthe sale wont  valid   ll all go back   estate these yer orphans ll git their house back agin  thats enough  them theyre young  spry  kn easy earn  livin they aint agoin  suffer why jest thinktheres thousns  thousns  aint nigh so well off bless you they aint got nothn  complain of” well  king  talked him blind so  last  give in  said all right but said  believed   blamed foolishness  stay   doctor hanging over them but  king says “cuss  doctor what do we kyer  him haint we got all  fools  town  our side and aint   big enough majority  any town” so they got ready  go down stairs again the duke says “i dont think we put  money   good place” that cheered me up id begun  think i warnt going  get  hint  no kind  help me the king says “why” “because mary jane ll   mourning  this out  first you know  nigger  does up  rooms  get  order  box these duds up  put em away  do you reckon  nigger can run across money  not borrow some  it” “your heads level agin duke” says  king   comes afumbling under  curtain two or three foot  where i was i stuck tight   wall  kept mighty still though quivery  i wondered what them fellows would say  me if they catched me  i tried  think what id better do if they did catch me but  king  got  bag before i could think more than about  half  thought   never suspicioned i  around they took  shoved  bag through  rip   straw tick   under  featherbed  crammed    foot or two amongst  straw  said   all right now because  nigger only makes up  featherbed  dont turn over  straw tick only about twice  year  so  warnt  no danger  getting stole now but i knowed better i had  out  there before they  halfway down stairs i groped along up  my cubby  hid  there till i could get  chance  do better i judged i better hide  outside   house somewheres because if they missed  they would give  house  good ransacking i knowed  very well then i turned in  my clothes all on but i couldnt  gone  sleep if id  wanted to i   such  sweat  get through   business by   i heard  king   duke come up so i rolled off my pallet  laid  my chin   top  my ladder  waited  see if anything  going  happen but nothing did so i held  till all  late sounds had quit   early ones hadnt begun yet  then i slipped down  ladder chapter xxvii i crept  their doors  listened they  snoring so i tiptoed along  got down stairs all right there warnt  sound anywheres i peeped through  crack   diningroom door  see  men   watching  corpse all sound asleep  their chairs the door  open into  parlor where  corpse  laying  there   candle  both rooms i passed along   parlor door  open but i see there warnt nobody  there but  remainders  peter so i shoved  by but  front door  locked   key wasnt there just then i heard somebody coming down  stairs back

run so much resk about it says i if  could stay where  is all right because when we get down  river  hundred mile or two i could write back  mary jane  she could dig him up again  get it but  aint

people begun  flock in   beats   girls took seats   front row   head   coffin    half  hour  people filed around slow  single rank  looked down   dead mans face  minute  some dropped   tear    all very still  solemn only  girls   beats holding handkerchiefs  their eyes  keeping their heads bent  sobbing  little there warnt no other sound but  scraping   feet   floor  blowing nosesbecause people always blows them more   funeral than they do  other places except church when  place  packed full  undertaker  slid around  his black gloves  his softy soothering ways putting   last touches  getting people  things all shipshape  comfortable  making no more sound than  cat he never spoke  moved people around  squeezed  late ones  opened up passageways  done   nods  signs  his hands then  took his place over against  wall he   softest glidingest stealthiest man i ever see  there warnt no more smile  him than there    ham they had borrowed  melodeuma sick one  when everything  ready  young woman set down  worked it    pretty skreeky  colicky  everybody joined   sung  peter   only one  had  good thing according  my notion then  reverend hobson opened up slow  solemn  begun  talk  straight off  most outrageous row busted out   cellar  body ever heard   only one dog but  made  most powerful racket   kept  up right along  parson  had  stand there over  coffin  waityou couldnt hear yourself think it  right down awkward  nobody didnt seem  know what  do but pretty soon they see  longlegged undertaker make  sign   preacher  much   say “dont you worryjust depend  me” then  stooped down  begun  glide along  wall just his shoulders showing over  peoples heads so  glided along   powwow  racket getting more  more outrageous all  time   last when  had gone around two sides   room  disappears down cellar then  about two seconds we heard  whack   dog  finished up   most amazing howl or two  then everything  dead still   parson begun his solemn talk where  left off in  minute or two here comes this undertakers back  shoulders gliding along  wall again  so  glided  glided around three sides   room  then rose up  shaded his mouth  his hands  stretched his neck out towards  preacher over  peoples heads  says   kind   coarse whisper “he had  rat” then  drooped down  glided along  wall again  his place you could see    great satisfaction   people because naturally they wanted  know a little thing like  dont cost nothing  its just  little things  makes  man   looked up   liked there warnt no more popular man  town than what  undertaker was well  funeral sermon  very good but pison long  tiresome  then  king  shoved   got off some  his usual rubbage   last  job  through   undertaker begun  sneak up   coffin  his screwdriver i    sweat then  watched him pretty keen

trouble without waking you up if they hadnt already waked you up” “great guns this   go” says  king  both  them looked pretty sick  tolerable silly they stood there athinking  scratching their heads  minute   duke  bust into  kind   little raspy chuckle  says “it does beat all how neat  niggers played their hand they let    sorry they  going out  this region and i believed they was sorry  so did

then thank goodness” says i kind  timidlike “is something gone wrong” the king whirls  me  rips out “none o your business you keep your head shet  mind yr own affairsif you got any long  youre  this town dont you forgit thatyou hear” then  says   duke “we got  jest swaller   say nothn mums  word  us” as they  starting down  ladder  duke  chuckles again  says “quick sales and small profits its  good businessyes” the king snarls around  him  says “i  trying  do   best  sellin em out so quick if  profits  turned out   none lackin considable  none  carry   my fault any moren its yourn” “well theyd   this house yet  we wouldnt if i could  got my advice listened to” the king sassed back  much   safe  him  then swapped around  lit into me again he give me down  banks  not coming  telling him i see  niggers come out  his room acting  waysaid any fool would  knowed something  up and then waltzed   cussed himself awhile  said  all come  him not laying late  taking his natural rest  morning  hed  blamed if hed ever do  again so they went off ajawing  i felt dreadful glad id worked  all off    niggers  yet hadnt done  niggers no harm  it chapter xxviii by     gettingup time so i come down  ladder  started  downstairs but  i come   girls room  door  open  i see mary jane setting  her old hair trunk which  open  shed been packing things  itgetting ready  go  england but she had stopped now   folded gown  her lap  had her face  her hands crying i felt awful bad  see it  course anybody would i went  there  says “miss mary jane you cant abear  see people  trouble  i cantmost always tell me about it” so she done it and    niggersi just expected it she said  beautiful trip  england  most about spoiled  her she didnt know how she  ever going   happy there knowing  mother   children warnt ever going  see each other no moreand then busted out bitterer than ever  flung up her hands  says “oh dear dear  think they aint ever going  see each other any more” “but they willand inside  two weeksand i know it” says i laws   out before i could think and before i could budge she throws her arms around my neck  told me  say  again say  again say  again i see i had spoke too sudden  said too much     close place i asked her  let me think  minute  she set there very impatient  excited  handsome but looking kind  happy  easedup like  person thats had  tooth pulled out so i went  studying  out i says  myself i reckon  body  ups  tells  truth when     tight place  taking considerable many resks though i aint had no experience  cant say  certain but  looks so  me anyway  yet heres  case where im blest if  dont look  me like  truth  better  actuly safer than  lie i must lay    my mind  think  over some time or other its so kind  strange  unregular i never see nothing like

ablazing higher  higher all  time  told her every blame thing  where we first struck  young fool going up   steamboat clear through  where she flung herself    kings breast   front door   kissed her sixteen or seventeen timesand then up she jumps  her face afire like sunset  says “the brute come dont waste  minutenot  secondwell have them tarred  feathered  flung   river” says i “certnly but do

kind   way  i said i would die first “i never thought i  so stirred up” she says “now go on  i wont do so any more you tell me what  do  whatever you say ill do it” “well” i says “its  rough gang them

says “miss mary jane ill tell you what well do  you wont have  stay  mr lothrops so long nuther how fur  it” “a little short  four milesright out   country back here” “well  ll answer now you go along

enough  tell her sono harm  it it  only  little thing  do  no trouble  its  little things  smooths peoples roads  most down here below  would make mary jane comfortable   wouldnt cost nothing then i says “theres one more thingthat bag  money” “well theyve got that   makes me feel pretty silly  think how they got it” “no youre out there they haint got it” “why whos got it” “i wish i knowed but i dont i had it because i stole   them  i stole   give  you  i know where i hid it but im afraid  aint there no more im awful sorry miss mary jane im just  sorry  i can be but i done  best i could i did

fault where did you hide it” i didnt want  set her  thinking about her troubles again  i couldnt seem  get my mouth  tell her what would make her see  corpse laying   coffin   bag  money  his stomach so   minute i didnt say nothing then i says “id ruther not tell you where i put it miss mary jane if you dont mind letting me off but ill write   you   piece  paper  you can read  along  road  mr lothrops if you want to do you reckon  ll do” “oh yes” so i wrote “i put    coffin it   there when you  crying there away   night i  behind  door  i  mighty sorry  you miss mary jane” it made my eyes water  little  remember her crying there all  herself   night  them devils laying there right under her own roof shaming her  robbing her  when i folded  up  give   her i see  water come into her eyes too  she shook me   hand hard  says “goodbye im going  do everything just  youve told me  if i dont ever see you again i shant ever forget you  ill think  you  many   many  time  ill pray  you too”and she  gone pray  me i reckoned if she knowed me shed take  job   more nearer her size but i bet she done it just  sameshe  just  kind she had  grit  pray  judus if she took  notionthere warnt no backdown  her i judge you may say what you want to but  my opinion she had more sand  her than any girl i ever see  my opinion she  just full  sand it sounds like flattery but  aint no flattery and when  comes  beautyand goodness tooshe lays over them all i haint ever seen her since  time  i see her go out   door no i haint ever seen her since but i reckon ive thought  her  many   many  million times   her saying she would pray  me  if ever id  thought  would do any good  me  pray  her blamed if i wouldnt  done  or bust well mary jane she lit out  back way i reckon because nobody see her go when i struck susan   harelip i says “whats  name  them people over  tother side   river  you all goes  see sometimes” they says “theres several but its  proctors mainly” “thats  name” i says “i most forgot it well miss mary jane she told me  tell you shes gone over there   dreadful hurryone  thems sick” “which one” “i dont know leastways i kinder forget but i thinks its” “sakes alive i hope  aint

“they dont dont they you better bet they do  these mumps these mumps  different its  new kind miss mary jane said” “hows   new kind” “because its mixed up  other things” “what other things” “well

mumps for” “why because  is  mumps thats what  starts with” “well ther aint no sense  it a body might stump his toe  take pison  fall down  well  break his neck  bust his brains out  somebody come

felt very good i judged i had done  pretty neati reckoned tom sawyer couldnt  done  no neater himself of course  would  throwed more style into it but i cant do  very handy not being brung up  it well they held  auction   public square along towards  end   afternoon   strung along  strung along   old man    hand  looking his level pisonest up there longside   auctioneer  chipping   little scripture now  then or  little goodygoody saying  some kind   duke   around googooing  sympathy all  knowed how  just spreading himself generly but     thing dragged through  everything  soldeverything but  little old trifling lot   graveyard so theyd got  work  offi never see such  girafft   king   wanting  swallow everything well whilst they     steamboat landed   about two minutes up comes  crowd awhooping  yelling  laughing  carrying on  singing out “heres your opposition line heres your two sets o heirs  old peter wilksand you pays your money  you takes your choice” chapter xxix they  fetching  very nicelooking old gentleman along   nicelooking younger one  his right arm   sling and my souls how  people yelled  laughed  kept  up but i didnt see no joke about it  i judged  would strain  duke   king some  see any i reckoned theyd turn pale but no nary  pale did they turn the duke  never let   suspicioned what  up but just went  googooing around happy  satisfied like  jug thats googling out buttermilk     king  just gazed  gazed down sorrowful  them newcomers like  give him  stomachache  his very heart  think there could  such frauds  rascals   world oh  done  admirable lots   principal people gethered around  king  let him see they   his side that old gentleman  had just come looked all puzzled  death pretty soon  begun  speak  i see straight off  pronounced like  englishmannot  kings way though  kings was pretty good   imitation i cant give  old gents words nor i cant imitate him but  turned around   crowd  says about like this “this   surprise  me which i wasnt looking for  ill acknowledge candid  frank i aint very well fixed  meet   answer it  my brother  me  had misfortunes hes broke his arm  our baggage got put off   town above here last night   night   mistake i am peter wilks brother harvey  this  his brother william which cant hear nor speakand cant even make signs  amount  much nowt hes only got one hand  work them with we  who we say we are    day or two when i get  baggage i can prove it but up till then i wont say nothing more but go   hotel  wait” so him   new dummy started off   king  laughs  blethers out “broke his armvery likely aint itand very convenient too   fraud thats got  make signs  aint learnt how lost their baggage thats mighty goodand mighty ingeniousunder  circumstances” so  laughed again  so did everybody else except three or four or maybe half  dozen one  these   doctor another one   sharplooking gentleman   carpetbag   oldfashioned kind made out  carpetstuff  had just come off   steamboat   talking  him   low voice  glancing towards  king now  then  nodding their headsit  levi bell  lawyer   gone up  louisville  another one   big rough husky  come along  listened  all  old gentleman said   listening   king now and when  king got done this husky up  says “say looky here if you  harvey wilks whend you come  this town” “the day before  funeral friend” says  king “but what time o day” “in  eveninbout  hour er two before sundown” “howd you come” “i come down   susan powell  cincinnati” “well then howd you come   up   pint   morninin  canoe” “i warnt up   pint   mornin” “its  lie” several  them jumped  him  begged him not  talk  way   old man   preacher “preacher  hanged hes  fraud   liar he  up   pint  mornin i live up there dont i well i  up there    up there i see him there he come   canoe along  tim collins   boy” the doctor  up  says “would you know  boy again if you   see him hines” “i reckon i would but i dont know why yonder  is now i know him perfectly easy” it  me  pointed at the doctor says “neighbors i dont know whether  new couple  frauds or not but if these two aint frauds i am  idiot thats all i think its our duty  see  they dont get away  here till weve looked into this thing come along hines come along  rest  you well take these fellows   tavern  affront them  tother couple  i reckon well find out something before we get through” it  nuts   crowd though maybe not   kings friends so we all started it  about sundown the doctor  led me along   hand   plenty kind enough but  never let go my hand we all got   big room   hotel  lit up some candles  fetched   new couple first  doctor says “i dont wish   too hard  these two men but i think theyre frauds  they may have complices  we dont know nothing about if they have wont  complices get away   bag  gold peter wilks left it aint unlikely if these men aint frauds they wont object  sending   money  letting us keep  till they prove theyre all rightaint  so” everybody agreed  that so i judged they had our gang   pretty tight place right   outstart but  king  only looked sorrowful  says “gentlemen i wish  money  there  i aint got no disposition  throw anything   way   fair open outandout investigation o this misable business but alas  money aint there you kn send  see if you want to” “where  it then” “well when my niece give   me  keep  her i took  hid  inside o  straw tick o my bed not wishin  bank    few days wed  here  considerin  bed  safe place we not bein used  niggers  supposn em honest like servants  england the niggers stole   very next mornin after i had went down stairs  when i sold em i hadnt missed  money yit so they got clean away  it my servant here kn tell you bout it gentlemen” the doctor  several said “shucks”  i see nobody didnt altogether believe him one man asked me if i see  niggers steal it i said no but i see them sneaking out   room  hustling away  i never thought nothing only i reckoned they  afraid they had waked up my master   trying  get away before  made trouble  them that  all they asked me then  doctor whirls  me  says “are you english too” i says yes  him  some others laughed  said “stuff” well then they sailed    general investigation  there we had it up  down hour in hour out  nobody never said  word about supper nor ever seemed  think about itand so they kept  up  kept  up   was  worst mixedup thing you ever see they made  king tell his yarn  they made  old gentleman tell hisn  anybody but  lot  prejudiced chuckleheads would  seen   old gentleman  spinning truth  tother one lies and    they had me up  tell what i knowed the king  give me  lefthanded look out   corner  his eye  so i knowed enough  talk   right side i begun  tell about sheffield  how we lived there  all about  english wilkses  so on but i didnt get pretty fur till  doctor begun  laugh  levi bell  lawyer says “set down my boy i wouldnt strain myself if i  you i reckon you aint used  lying  dont seem  come handy what you want  practice you do  pretty awkward” i didnt care nothing   compliment but i  glad   let off anyway the doctor  started  say something  turns  says “if youd been  town  first levi bell” the king broke   reached out his hand  says “why  this my poor dead brothers old friend  hes wrote so often about” the lawyer  him shook hands   lawyer smiled  looked pleased  they talked right along awhile  then got  one side  talked low   last  lawyer speaks up  says “that ll fix it ill take  order  send it along  your brothers  then theyll know its all right” so they got some paper   pen   king  set down  twisted his head  one side  chawed his tongue  scrawled off something  then they give  pen   dukeand then   first time  duke looked sick but  took  pen  wrote so then  lawyer turns   new old gentleman  says “you  your brother please write  line or two  sign your names” the old gentleman wrote but nobody couldnt read it the lawyer looked powerful astonished  says “well  beats me”and snaked  lot  old letters out  his pocket  examined them  then examined  old mans writing  then them again  then says “these old letters   harvey wilks  heres these two handwritings  anybody can see they didnt write them” the king   duke looked sold  foolish i tell you  see how  lawyer had took them in “and heres this old gentlemans hand writing  anybody can tell easy enough he didnt write themfact is  scratches  makes aint properly writing  all now heres some letters from” the new old gentleman says “if you please let me explain nobody can read my hand but my brother thereso  copies  me its his hand youve got there not mine” “well” says  lawyer “this is  state  things ive got some  williams letters too so if youll get him  write  line or so we can com” “he cant write  his left hand” says  old gentleman “if  could use his right hand you would see   wrote his own letters  mine too look  both pleasetheyre   same hand” the lawyer done it  says “i believe its soand if  aint so theres  heap stronger resemblance than id noticed before anyway well well well i thought we  right   track   solution but its gone  grass partly but anyway one thing  provedthese two aint either  em wilkses”and  wagged his head towards  king   duke well what do you think that muleheaded old fool wouldnt give  then indeed  wouldnt said  warnt no fair test said his brother william   cussedest joker   world  hadnt tried  writehe see william  going  play one  his jokes  minute  put  pen  paper and so  warmed up  went warbling  warbling right along till   actuly beginning  believe what   saying himself but pretty soon  new gentleman broke in  says “ive thought  something is there anybody here  helped  lay out my brhelped  lay out  late peter wilks  burying” “yes” says somebody “me  ab turner done it were both here” then  old man turns towards  king  says “perhaps this gentleman can tell me what  tattooed  his breast” blamed if  king didnt have  brace up mighty quick or hed  squshed down like  bluff bank   river  cut under  took him so sudden and mind you    thing   calculated  make most anybody sqush  get fetched such  solid one   without any notice because how  he going  know what  tattooed   man he whitened  little  couldnt help it    mighty still  there  everybody bending  little forwards  gazing  him says i  myself now hell throw up  spongethere aint no more use well did he a body cant hardly believe it but  didnt i reckon  thought hed keep  thing up till  tired them people out so theyd thin out  him   duke could break loose  get away anyway  set there  pretty soon  begun  smile  says “mf its  very tough question aint it yes sir i kn tell you whats tattooed  his breast its jest  small thin blue arrowthats what  is  if you dont look clost you cant see it now what do you sayhey” well i never see anything like  old blister  clean outandout cheek the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner  his pard  his eye lights up like  judged hed got  king this time  says “thereyouve heard what  said was there any such mark  peter wilks breast” both  them spoke up  says “we didnt see no such mark” “good” says  old gentleman “now what you did see  his breast   small dim p   b which   initial  dropped when   young   w  dashes between them so pbw”and  marked them  way   piece  paper “come aint  what you saw” both  them spoke up again  says “no we didnt we never seen any marks  all” well everybody was   state  mind now  they sings out “the whole bilin  m s frauds les duck em les drown em les ride em   rail”  everybody  whooping  once  there   rattling powwow but  lawyer  jumps   table  yells  says “gentlemengentlemen hear me just  wordjust  single wordif you please theres one way yetlets go  dig up  corpse  look” that took them “hooray” they all shouted   starting right off but  lawyer   doctor sung out “hold on hold on collar all these four men   boy  fetch them along too” “well do it” they all shouted “and if we dont find them marks well lynch  whole gang” i was scared now i tell you but there warnt no getting away you know they gripped us all  marched us right along straight   graveyard which   mile   half down  river   whole town  our heels  we made noise enough    only nine   evening as we went  our house i wished i hadnt sent mary jane out  town because now if i could tip her  wink shed light out  save me  blow  our deadbeats well we swarmed along down  river road just carrying  like wildcats   make  more scary  sky  darking up   lightning beginning  wink  flitter   wind  shiver amongst  leaves this   most awful trouble  most dangersome i ever  in  i  kinder stunned everything  going so different  what i had allowed for stead  being fixed so i could take my own time if i wanted to  see all  fun  have mary jane  my back  save me  set me free when  closefit come here  nothing   world betwixt me  sudden death but just them tattoomarks if they didnt find them i couldnt bear  think about it  yet somehow i couldnt think about nothing else it got darker  darker     beautiful time  give  crowd  slip but  big husky had me   wristhinesand  body might  well try  give goliar  slip he dragged me right along   so excited  i had  run  keep up when they got there they

squirm “yes” says  duke kinder slow  deliberate  sarcastic “we did” after about  half  minute  king drawls out “leastways i did” the duke says  same way “on  contrary i did” the king kind  ruffles up  says “looky here bilgewater whatr you referrin to” the duke says pretty brisk “when  comes  that maybe youll let me ask what  you referring to” “shucks” says  king very sarcastic “but i dont knowmaybe

gasps out “noughi own up” i  very glad  hear him say that  made me feel much more easier than what i  feeling before so  duke took his hands off  says “if you ever deny  again ill drown you its well  you  set there  blubber like  babyits fitten  you after  way youve acted i never see such  old ostrich  wanting  gobble everythingand i atrusting you all  time like you  my own father you ought  been

lovinger they got  went off asnoring  each others arms they both got powerful mellow but i noticed  king didnt get mellow enough  forget  remember  not deny about hiding  moneybag again that made me feel easy  satisfied of course when they got  snoring we had  long gabble  i told jim everything chapter xxxi we dasnt stop again  any town  days  days kept right along down  river we  down south   warm weather now   mighty long ways  home we begun  come  trees  spanish moss  them hanging down   limbs like long gray beards it   first i ever see  growing   made  woods look solemn  dismal so now  frauds reckoned they  out  danger  they begun  work  villages again first they done  lecture  temperance but they didnt make enough  them both  get drunk on then  another village they started  dancingschool but they didnt know no more how  dance than  kangaroo does so  first prance they made  general public jumped   pranced them out  town another time they tried  go  yellocution but they didnt yellocute long till  audience got up  give them  solid good cussing  made them skip out they tackled missionarying  mesmerizing  doctoring  telling fortunes   little  everything but they couldnt seem  have no luck so  last they got just about dead broke  laid around  raft  she floated along thinking  thinking  never saying nothing   half  day   time  dreadful blue  desperate and  last they took  change  begun  lay their heads together   wigwam  talk low  confidential two or three hours   time jim  me got uneasy we didnt like  look  it we judged they  studying up some kind  worse deviltry than ever we turned  over  over   last we made up our minds they  going  break into somebodys house or store or  going into  counterfeitmoney business or something so then we  pretty scared  made up  agreement  we wouldnt have nothing   world  do  such actions  if we ever got  least show we would give them  cold shake  clear out  leave them behind well early one morning we hid  raft   good safe place about two mile below  little bit   shabby village named pikesville   king  went ashore  told us all  stay hid whilst  went up  town  smelt around  see if anybody had got any wind   royal nonesuch there yet “house  rob you mean” says i  myself “and when you get through robbing  youll come back here  wonder what  become  me  jim   raftand youll have  take  out  wondering” and  said if  warnt back  midday  duke  me would know   all right  we   come along so we stayed where we was the duke  fretted  sweated around     mighty sour way he scolded us  everything  we couldnt seem  do nothing right  found fault  every little thing something  abrewing sure i  good  glad when midday come  no king we could have  change anywayand maybe  chance  the change  top  it so me   duke went up   village  hunted around there   king     we found him   back room   little low doggery very tight   lot  loafers bullyragging him  sport   acussing  athreatening  all his might  so tight  couldnt walk  couldnt do nothing  them the duke  begun  abuse him   old fool   king begun  sass back   minute they  fairly   i lit out  shook  reefs out  my hind legs  spun down  river road like  deer  i see

that  my fix exactly the more i studied about this  more my conscience went  grinding me   more wicked  lowdown  ornery i got  feeling and  last when  hit me all   sudden  here   plain hand  providence slapping me   face  letting me know my wickedness  being watched all  time  up there  heaven whilst i  stealing  poor old womans nigger  hadnt ever done me no harm  now  showing me theres one thats always   lookout  aint agoing  allow no such miserable doings  go only just so fur  no further i most dropped  my tracks i  so scared well i tried  best i could  kinder soften  up somehow  myself  saying i  brung up wicked  so i warnt so much  blame but something inside  me kept saying “there   sundayschool you could  gone  it  if youd  done  theyd  learnt you there  people  acts  id been acting about  nigger goes  everlasting fire” it made me shiver and i about made up my mind  pray  see if i couldnt try  quit being  kind   boy i    better so i kneeled down but  words wouldnt come why wouldnt they it warnt no use  try  hide   him nor  me neither i knowed very well why they wouldnt come it  because my heart warnt right   because i warnt square   because i  playing double i  letting on  give up sin but away inside  me i  holding    biggest one  all i  trying  make my mouth say i would do  right thing   clean thing  go  write   niggers owner  tell where  was but deep down  me i knowed    lie  he knowed it you cant pray  liei found  out so i  full  trouble full  i could be  didnt know what  do at last i had  idea  i says ill go  write  letterand then see if i can pray

but i didnt do  straight off but laid  paper down  set there thinkingthinking how good   all this happened so  how near i come  being lost  going  hell and went  thinking and got  thinking over our trip down  river  i see jim before me all  time   day    nighttime sometimes moonlight sometimes storms  we afloating along talking  singing  laughing but somehow i couldnt seem  strike no places  harden me against him but only  other kind id see him standing my watch  top  hisn stead  calling me so i could go  sleeping  see him how glad   when i come back out   fog  when i come  him again   swamp up there where  feud was  suchlike times  would always call me honey  pet me  do everything  could think   me  how good  always was   last i struck  time i saved him  telling  men we had smallpox aboard    so grateful  said i   best friend old jim ever had   world   only one hes got now  then i happened  look around  see  paper it   close place i took  up  held   my hand i  atrembling because id got  decide forever betwixt two things  i knowed it i studied  minute sort  holding my breath  then says  myself “all right then ill go  hell”and tore  up it  awful thoughts  awful words but they  said and i let them stay said  never thought no more about reforming i shoved  whole thing out  my head  said i would take up wickedness again which   my line being brung up  it   other warnt and   starter i would go  work  steal jim out  slavery again  if i could think up anything worse i would do that too because  long  i  in    good i might  well go  whole hog then i set  thinking over how  get  it  turned over some considerable many ways  my mind   last fixed up  plan  suited me so then i took  bearings   woody island   down  river  piece   soon    fairly dark i crept out  my raft  went  it  hid  there  then turned in i slept  night through  got up before   light  had my breakfast  put  my store clothes  tied up some others  one thing or another   bundle  took  canoe  cleared  shore i landed below where i judged  phelpss place  hid my bundle   woods  then filled up  canoe  water  loaded rocks into her  sunk her where i could find her again when i wanted her about  quarter   mile below  little steam sawmill     bank then i struck up  road  when i passed  mill i see  sign  it “phelpss sawmill”  when i come   farmhouses two or three hundred yards further along i kept my eyes peeled but didnt see nobody around though   good daylight now but i didnt mind because i didnt want  see nobody just yeti only wanted  get  lay   land according  my plan i  going  turn up there   village not  below so i just took  look  shoved along straight  town well  very first man i see when i got there   duke he  sticking up  bill   royal nonesuchthreenight performancelike  other time they had  cheek them frauds i  right  him before i could shirk he looked astonished  says “hello whered you come from” then  says kind  glad  eager “wheres  raftgot her   good place” i says “why thats just what i  going  ask your grace” then  didnt look so joyful  says “what  your idea  asking me”  says “well” i says “when i see  king   doggery yesterday i says  myself we cant get him home  hours till hes soberer so i went aloafing around town  put   time  wait a man up  offered me ten cents  help him pull  skiff over  river  back  fetch  sheep  so i went along but when we  dragging him   boat   man left me aholt   rope  went behind him  shove him along   too strong  me  jerked loose  run  we after him we didnt have no dog  so we had  chase him all over  country till we tired him out we never got him till dark then we fetched him over  i started down   raft when i got there  see   gone i says  myself theyve got into trouble  had  leave  theyve took my nigger which   only nigger ive got   world  now im   strange country  aint got no property no more nor nothing  no way  make my living so i set down  cried i slept   woods all night but what did become   raft thenand jimpoor

but begged him  spend   something  eat  give me some because   all  money i had  i hadnt had nothing  eat since yesterday he never said nothing the next minute  whirls  me  says “do you reckon  nigger would blow  us wed skin him if  done that” “how can  blow haint  run off” “no that old fool sold him  never divided  me   moneys gone” “sold him” i says  begun  cry “why   my nigger    my money where  hei want my nigger” “well you cant get your nigger thats allso dry up your blubbering looky heredo you think youd venture  blow  us blamed if i think id trust you why if you was  blow  us” he stopped but i never see  duke look so ugly out  his eyes before i went  awhimpering  says “i dont want  blow  nobody  i aint got no time  blow nohow i got  turn out  find my nigger” he looked kinder bothered  stood there  his bills fluttering  his arm thinking  wrinkling up his forehead at last  says “ill tell you something we got   here three days if youll promise you wont blow  wont let  nigger blow ill tell you where  find him” so i promised   says “a farmer   name  silas ph”  then  stopped you see  started  tell me  truth but when  stopped  way  begun  study  think again i reckoned   changing his mind and so  was he wouldnt trust me  wanted  make sure  having me out   way  whole three days so pretty soon  says “the man  bought him  named abram fosterabram g fosterand  lives forty mile back here   country   road  lafayette” “all right” i says “i can walk   three days and ill start this very afternoon” “no you wont youll start now  dont you lose any time about it neither nor do any gabbling   way just keep  tight tongue  your head  move right along  then you wont get into trouble  us dye hear” that   order i wanted     one i played for i wanted   left free  work my plans “so clear out”  says “and you can tell mr foster whatever you want to maybe you can get him  believe  jim is your niggersome idiots dont require documentsleastways ive heard theres such down south here and when you tell him  handbill   rewards bogus maybe hell believe you when you explain  him what  idea   getting em out go long now  tell him anything you want to but mind you dont work your jaw any between here  there” so i left  struck   back country i didnt look around but i kinder felt like   watching me but i knowed i could tire him out  that i went straight out   country  much   mile before i stopped then i doubled back through  woods towards phelps i reckoned i better start   my plan straight off without fooling around because i wanted  stop jims mouth till these fellows could get away

it which  all right  worked firstrate because they didnt know but what  would take three days  fix it if id  called   bolthead  would  done just  well now i  feeling pretty comfortable all down one side  pretty uncomfortable all up  other being tom sawyer  easy  comfortable   stayed easy  comfortable till    i hear  steamboat coughing along down  river then i says  myself spose tom sawyer comes down   boat and spose  steps  here any minute  sings out my name before i can throw him  wink  keep quiet well i couldnt have   way  wouldnt do  all i must go up  road  waylay him so i told  folks i reckoned i would go up   town  fetch down my baggage the old gentleman   going along  me but i said no i could drive  horse myself  i druther  wouldnt take no trouble about me chapter xxxiii so i started  town   wagon  when i  halfway i see  wagon coming  sure enough   tom sawyer  i stopped  waited till  come along i says “hold on”   stopped alongside  his mouth opened up like  trunk  stayed so   swallowed two or three times like  person thats got  dry throat  then says “i haint ever done you no harm you know that so then what you want  come back  hant me for” i says “i haint come backi

feel  me if you dont believe me” so  done it   satisfied him     glad  see me again  didnt know what  do and  wanted  know all about  right off because    grand adventure  mysterious  so  hit him where  lived but i said leave  alone till   by  told his driver  wait  we drove off  little piece  i told him  kind   fix i  in  what did  reckon we better do he said let him alone  minute  dont disturb him so  thought  thought  pretty soon  says “its all right ive got it take my trunk  your wagon  let  its yourn  you turn back  fool along slow so   get   house about  time you ought to  ill go towards town  piece  take  fresh start  get there  quarter or  half  hour after you  you neednt let   know me  first” i says “all right but wait  minute theres one more thinga thing  nobody dont

aint joking either” “well then” i says “joking or no joking if you hear anything said about  runaway nigger dont forget  remember  you dont know nothing about him  i dont know nothing about him” then we took  trunk  put   my wagon   drove off his way  i drove mine but  course i forgot all about driving slow  accounts  being glad  full  thinking so i got home  heap too quick   length   trip the old gentleman    door   says “why this  wonderful whoever would  thought     mare  do it i wish wed  timed her and she haint sweated  hairnot  hair its wonderful why i wouldnt take  hundred dollars

farmer    preacher too  had  little onehorse log church down back   plantation which  built  himself  his own expense   church  schoolhouse  never charged nothing  his preaching    worth it too there  plenty other farmerpreachers like that  done  same way down south in about half  hour toms wagon drove up   front stile  aunt sally she see  through  window because   only about fifty yards  says “why

persuaded  come in  when     said    stranger  hicksville ohio  his name  william thompsonand  made another bow well  run on  on  on making up stuff about hicksville  everybody    could invent  i getting  little nervious  wondering how this  going  help me out  my scrape   last still talking along  reached over  kissed aunt sally right   mouth  then settled back again  his chair comfortable

“why no iiwell no i blieve i didnt” then  looks  around  same way  me  says “tom didnt you think aunt sally d open out her arms  say sid sawyer” “my land” she says breaking   jumping  him “you impudent young rascal  fool  body so”   going  hug him but  fended her off  says “no not till youve asked me first” so she didnt lose no time but asked him  hugged him  kissed him over  over again  then turned him over   old man   took what  left and after they got  little quiet again she says “why dear me i never see such  surprise we warnt looking  you  all but only tom sis never wrote  me about anybody coming but him” “its because  warnt intended  any  us  come but tom”  says “but i begged  begged    last minute she let me come too so coming down  river me  tom thought  would

neither  way ive seen them kind  interruptions do lots  times there   considerable good deal  talk all  afternoon  me  tom    lookout all  time but  warnt no use they didnt happen  say nothing about any runaway nigger  we  afraid  try  work up  it but  supper  night one   little boys says “pa maynt tom  sid  me go   show” “no” says  old man “i reckon there aint going   any  you couldnt go if there was because  runaway nigger told burton  me all about  scandalous show  burton said  would tell  people so i reckon theyve drove  owdacious loafers out  town before this time” so there  wasbut i couldnt help it tom  me   sleep   same room  bed so being tired we bid goodnight  went up  bed right after supper  clumb out   window  down  lightningrod  shoved   town  i didnt believe anybody  going

pison him it takes up more room than all  rest   persons insides  yet aint no good nohow tom sawyer  says  same chapter xxxiv we stopped talking  got  thinking by   tom says “looky here huck what fools we   not think   before i bet i know where jim is” “no where” “in  hut down   ashhopper why looky here when we   dinner didnt you see  nigger man go  there  some vittles” “yes” “what did you

nor mate   steamboat nor clown   circus nor nothing i can think of i went  thinking out  plan but only just   doing something i knowed very well where  right plan  going  come from pretty soon tom says “ready” “yes” i says “all rightbring  out” “my plan  this” i says “we can easy find out if its jim  there then get up my canoe tomorrow night  fetch my raft over   island then  first dark night  comes steal  key out   old mans britches after  goes  bed  shove off down  river   raft  jim hiding daytimes  running nights  way me  jim used  do before wouldnt  plan work” “work why certnly  would work like rats afighting but its too blame simple there aint nothing to it whats  good   plan  aint no more trouble than that its  mild  goosemilk why huck  wouldnt make no more talk than breaking into  soap factory” i never said nothing because i warnt expecting nothing different but i knowed mighty well  whenever  got his plan ready  wouldnt have none  them objections  it and  didnt he told me what  was  i see   minute   worth fifteen  mine  style  would make jim just  free  man  mine would  maybe get us all killed besides so i  satisfied  said we would waltz   it i neednt tell what   here because i knowed  wouldnt stay  way  was i knowed  would  changing  around every which way  we went along  heaving  new bullinesses wherever  got  chance and   what  done well one thing  dead

bright  not leatherheaded  knowing  not ignorant  not mean but kind  yet here  was without any more pride or rightness or feeling than  stoop  this business  make himself  shame  his family  shame before everybody i couldnt understand  no way  all it  outrageous  i knowed i ought  just up  tell him so  so  his true friend  let him quit  thing right where    save himself and i did start  tell him but  shut me up  says “dont you reckon i know what im about dont i generly know what im about” “yes” “didnt i say i  going  help steal  nigger” “yes” “well then” thats all  said  thats all i said it warnt no use  say any more because when  said hed do  thing  always done it but i couldnt make out how   willing  go into this thing so i just let  go  never bothered no more about it if   bound  have  so i couldnt help it when we got home  house  all dark  still so we went  down   hut   ashhopper   examine it we went through  yard so   see what  hounds would do they knowed us  didnt make no more noise than country dogs  always doing when anything comes    night when we got   cabin we took  look   front   two sides    side i warnt acquainted withwhich   north sidewe found  square windowhole up tolerable high  just one stout board nailed across it i says “heres  ticket this holes big enough  jim  get through if we wrench off  board” tom says “its  simple  tittattoe threeinarow   easy  playing hooky i should hope we can find  way thats  little more complicated than that huck finn” “well then” i says “how ll  do  saw him out  way i done before i  murdered  time” “thats more like”  says “its real mysterious  troublesome  good”  says “but i bet we can find  way thats twice  long there aint no hurry les keep  looking around” betwixt  hut   fence   back side   leanto  joined  hut   eaves   made out  plank it   long   hut but narrowonly about six foot wide the door      south end   padlocked tom  went   soapkettle  searched around  fetched back  iron thing they lift  lid with so  took   prized out one   staples the chain fell down  we opened  door  went in  shut it  struck  match  see  shed  only built against  cabin  hadnt no connection  it  there warnt no floor   shed nor nothing   but some old rusty playedout hoes  spades  picks   crippled plow the match went out  so did we  shoved   staple again   door  locked  good  ever tom  joyful he says “now were all right well dig him out it ll take about  week” then we started   house  i went   back dooryou only have  pull  buckskin latchstring they dont fasten  doorsbut  warnt romantical enough  tom sawyer no way would do him but  must climb up  lightningrod but after  got up half way about three times  missed fire  fell every time   last time most busted his brains out  thought hed got  give  up but after   rested  allowed  would give her one more turn  luck  this time  made  trip in  morning we  up  break  day  down   nigger cabins  pet  dogs  make friends   nigger  fed jimif  was jim   being fed the niggers  just getting through breakfast  starting   fields  jims nigger  piling up  tin pan  bread  meat  things  whilst  others  leaving  key come   house this nigger had  goodnatured chuckleheaded face  his wool  all tied up  little bunches  thread that   keep witches off he said  witches  pestering him awful these nights  making him see all kinds  strange things  hear all kinds  strange words  noises   didnt believe   ever witched so long before  his life he got so worked up  got  running  so about his troubles  forgot all about what hed been agoing  do so tom says “whats  vittles for going  feed  dogs” the nigger kind  smiled around gradually over his face like when you heave  brickbat   mudpuddle   says “yes mars sid a dog curus dog too does you want  go en look  im” “yes” i hunched tom  whispers “you going right here   daybreak that warnt  plan” “no  warnt but its  plan now” so drat him we went along but i didnt like  much when we got  we couldnt hardly see anything   so dark but jim  there sure enough  could see us   sings out “why huck en good lan ain dat misto tom” i just knowed how  would be i just expected it i didnt know nothing  do  if i had i couldnt  done it because  nigger busted   says “why de gracious sakes do  know you genlmen” we could see pretty well now tom  looked   nigger steady  kind  wondering  says “does who know us” “why disyer runaway nigger” “i dont reckon  does but what put  into your head” “what put  dar didn  jis dis minute sing out like  knowed you” tom says   puzzledup kind  way “well thats mighty curious who sung out when did  sing out what did  sing out” and turns  me perfectly cam  says “did you hear anybody sing out” of course there warnt nothing   said but  one thing so i says “no i aint heard nobody say nothing” then  turns  jim  looks him over like  never see him before  says “did you sing out” “no sah” says jim “i haint said nothing sah” “not  word” “no sah i haint said  word” “did you ever see us before” “no sah not  i knows on” so tom turns   nigger which  looking wild  distressed  says kind  severe “what do you reckons  matter  you anyway what made you think somebody sung out” “oh its de dadblame

silas  going  hang this nigger if i   catch  nigger   ungrateful enough  run away i wouldnt give him up id hang him” and whilst  nigger stepped   door  look   dime  bite   see if   good  whispers  jim  says “dont ever let   know us and if you hear any digging going  nights its us were going  set you free” jim only had time  grab us   hand  squeeze it then  nigger come back  we said wed come again some time if  nigger wanted us to   said  would more particular if   dark because  witches went  him mostly   dark    good  have folks around then chapter xxxv it would  most  hour yet till breakfast

all  aint  prisoners plates” “but its somebodys plates aint it” “well sposn  is what does  prisoner care whose” he broke off there because we heard  breakfasthorn blowing so we cleared out   house along during  morning i borrowed  sheet   white shirt off   clothesline  i found  old sack  put them  it  we went down  got  foxfire  put   too i called  borrowing because   what pap always called it but tom said  warnt borrowing   stealing he said we  representing prisoners  prisoners dont care how they get  thing so they get it  nobody dont blame them  it either it aint no crime   prisoner  steal  thing  needs  get away with tom said its his right  so  long  we  representing  prisoner we had  perfect right  steal anything  this place we had  least use   get ourselves out  prison with he said if we warnt prisoners  would   very different thing  nobody but  mean ornery person would steal when  warnt  prisoner so we allowed we would steal everything there   come handy and yet  made  mighty fuss one day after that when i stole  watermelon out   niggerpatch  eat it   made me go  give  niggers  dime without telling them what   for tom said  what  meant was we could steal anything we needed well i says i needed  watermelon but  said i didnt need   get out  prison with theres where  difference was he said if id  wanted   hide  knife in  smuggle   jim  kill  seneskal with  would  been all right so i let  go  that though i couldnt see no advantage  my representing  prisoner if i got  set down  chaw over  lot  goldleaf distinctions like  every time i see  chance  hog  watermelon well  i  saying we waited  morning till everybody  settled down  business  nobody  sight around  yard then tom  carried  sack into  leanto whilst i stood off  piece  keep watch by    come out  we went  set down   woodpile  talk he says “everythings all right now except tools  thats easy fixed” “tools” i says “yes” “tools  what” “why  dig with we aint agoing  gnaw him out  we” “aint them old crippled picks  things  there good enough  dig  nigger out with” i says he turns  me looking pitying enough  make  body cry  says “huck finn did you ever hear   prisoner having picks  shovels  all  modern conveniences  his wardrobe  dig himself out with now i want  ask youif you got any reasonableness  you  allwhat kind   show would that give him    hero why they might  well lend him  key  done  it picks  shovelswhy they wouldnt furnish em   king” “well then” i says “if we dont want  picks  shovels what do we want” “a couple  caseknives” “to dig  foundations out  under  cabin with” “yes” “confound it its foolish tom” “it dont make no difference how foolish  is its  right wayand its  regular way and there aint no other way  ever i heard of  ive read all  books  gives any information about these things they always dig out   caseknifeand not through dirt mind you generly its through solid rock and  takes them weeks  weeks  weeks   ever  ever why look  one  them prisoners   bottom dungeon   castle deef   harbor  marseilles  dug himself out  way how long  he  it you reckon” “i dont know” “well guess” “i dont know a month   half” “thirtyseven yearand  come out  china thats  kind i wish  bottom  this fortress  solid rock” “jim dont know nobody  china” “whats that got  do  it neither did  other fellow but youre always awandering off   side issue why cant you stick   main point” “all righti dont care where  comes out so  comes out  jim dont either i reckon but theres one thing anywayjims too old   dug out   caseknife he wont last” “yes   last too you dont reckon its going  take thirtyseven years  dig out through  dirt foundation do you” “how long   take tom” “well we cant resk being  long  we ought to because  maynt take very long  uncle silas  hear  down there  new orleans hell hear jim aint  there then his next move    advertise jim or something like that so we cant resk being  long digging him out  we ought to by rights i reckon we ought    couple  years but we cant things being so uncertain what i recommend  this  we really dig right in  quick  we can  after that we can let on  ourselves  we    thirtyseven years then we can snatch him out  rush him away  first time theres  alarm yes i reckon  ll   best way” “now theres sense  that” i says “letting  dont cost nothing letting  aint no trouble  if its any object i dont mind letting  we     hundred  fifty year it wouldnt strain me none after i got my hand in so ill mosey along now  smouch  couple  caseknives” “smouch three”  says “we want one  make  saw out of” “tom if  aint unregular  irreligious  sejest it” i says “theres  old rusty sawblade around yonder sticking under  weatherboarding behind  smokehouse” he looked kind  weary  discouragedlike  says “it aint no use  try  learn you nothing huck run along  smouch  knivesthree  them” so i done it chapter xxxvi as soon  we reckoned everybody  asleep  night we went down  lightningrod  shut ourselves up   leanto  got out our pile  foxfire  went  work we cleared everything out   way about four or five foot along  middle   bottom log tom said   right behind jims bed now  wed dig  under it  when we got through there couldnt nobody   cabin ever know there  any hole there because jims counterpin hung down most   ground  youd have  raise  up  look under  see  hole so we dug  dug   caseknives till most midnight  then we  dogtired  our hands  blistered  yet you couldnt see wed done anything hardly at last i says “this aint no thirtyseven year job this   thirtyeight year job tom sawyer” he never said nothing but  sighed  pretty soon  stopped digging  then   good little while i knowed    thinking then  says “it aint no use huck  aint agoing  work if we  prisoners  would because then wed have  many years  we wanted  no hurry  we wouldnt get but  few minutes  dig every day while they  changing watches  so our hands wouldnt get blistered  we could keep  up right along year   year out  do  right   way  ought   done but we cant fool along we got  rush we aint got no time  spare if we   put  another night this way wed have  knock off   week  let our hands get wellcouldnt touch  caseknife  them sooner” “well then what we going  do tom” “ill tell you it aint right   aint moral  i wouldnt like   get out but there aint only just  one way we got  dig him out   picks  let on its caseknives” “now youre talking” i says “your head gets leveler  leveler all  time tom sawyer” i says “picks   thing moral or no moral    me i dont care shucks   morality  it nohow when i start   steal  nigger or  watermelon or  sundayschool book i aint no ways particular how its done so its done what i want  my nigger or what i want  my watermelon or what i want  my sundayschool book  if  picks  handiest thing thats  thing im agoing  dig  nigger or  watermelon or  sundayschool book out with  i dont give  dead rat what  authorities thinks about  nuther” “well”  says “theres excuse  picks  lettingon   case like this if  warnt so i wouldnt approve  it nor i wouldnt stand   see  rules brokebecause right  right  wrong  wrong   body aint got no business doing wrong when  aint ignorant  knows better it might answer  you  dig jim out   pick without any letting on because you dont know no better but  wouldnt  me because i do know better gimme  caseknife” he had his own  him but i handed him mine he flung  down  says “gimme  caseknife” i didnt know just what  dobut then i thought i scratched around amongst  old tools  got  pickaxe  give   him   took   went  work  never said  word he  always just  particular full  principle so then i got  shovel  then we picked  shoveled turn about  made  fur fly we stuck   about  half  hour which   long  we could stand up but we had  good deal   hole  show  it when i got up stairs i looked out   window  see tom doing his level best   lightningrod but  couldnt come it his hands  so sore at last  says “it aint no use  cant  done what you reckon i better do cant you think  no way” “yes” i says “but i reckon  aint regular come up  stairs  let  its  lightningrod” so  done it next day tom stole  pewter spoon   brass candlestick   house   make some pens  jim out of  six tallow candles  i hung around  nigger cabins  laid   chance  stole three tin plates tom says  wasnt enough but i said nobody wouldnt ever see  plates  jim throwed out because theyd fall   dogfennel  jimpson weeds under  windowholethen we could tote them back   could use them over again so tom  satisfied then  says “now  thing  study out is how  get  things  jim” “take them  through  hole” i says “when we get  done” he only just looked scornful  said something about nobody ever heard  such  idiotic idea  then  went  studying by    said  had ciphered out two or three ways but there warnt no need  decide  any  them yet said wed got  post jim first that night we went down  lightningrod  little after ten  took one   candles along  listened under  windowhole  heard jim snoring so we pitched  in   didnt wake him then we whirled    pick  shovel   about two hours   half  job  done we crept  under jims bed  into  cabin  pawed around  found  candle  lit it  stood over jim awhile  found him looking hearty  healthy  then we woke him up gentle  gradual he  so glad  see us  most cried  called us honey  all  pet names  could think of    having us hunt up  coldchisel  cut  chain off  his leg  right away  clearing out without losing any time but tom  showed him how unregular  would be  set down  told him all about our plans  how we could alter them   minute any time there   alarm  not    least afraid because we would see  got away sure so jim  said   all right  we set there  talked over old times awhile  then tom asked  lot  questions  when jim told him uncle silas come  every day or two  pray  him  aunt sally come   see if   comfortable  had plenty  eat  both  them  kind  they could be tom says “now i know how  fix it well send you some things  them” i said “dont do nothing   kind its one   most jackass ideas i ever struck” but  never paid no attention  me went right on it  his way when hed got his plans set so  told jim how wed have  smuggle   ropeladder pie  other large things  nat  nigger  fed him   must    lookout  not  surprised  not let nat see him open them  we would put small things  uncles coatpockets   must steal them out  we would tie things  aunts apronstrings or put them  her apronpocket if we got  chance  told him what they would   what they  for and told him how  keep  journal   shirt  his blood  all that he told him everything jim  couldnt see no sense   most  it but  allowed we  white folks  knowed better than him so   satisfied  said  would do  all just  tom said jim had plenty corncob pipes  tobacco so we had  right down good sociable time then we crawled out through  hole  so home  bed  hands  looked like theyd been chawed tom   high spirits he said    best fun  ever had  his life   most intellectural  said if  only could see his way   we would keep  up all  rest  our lives  leave jim  our children  get out   believed jim would come  like  better  better  more  got used  it he said    way  could  strung out   much  eighty year  would   best time  record and  said  would make us all celebrated  had  hand  it in  morning we went out   woodpile  chopped up  brass candlestick into handy sizes  tom put them   pewter

hounds bulging   under jims bed  they kept  piling  till there  eleven  them  there warnt hardly room  there  get your breath by jings we forgot  fasten  leanto door the nigger nat  only just hollered “witches” once  keeled over    floor amongst  dogs  begun  groan like   dying tom jerked  door open  flung out  slab  jims meat   dogs went  it   two seconds   out himself  back again  shut  door  i

took up his hat   shinglenail fell out   floor   just merely picked  up  laid    mantelshelf  never said nothing  went out tom see him do it  remembered about  spoon  says “well  aint no use  send things  him no more  aint reliable” then  says “but  done us  good turn   spoon anyway without knowing it  so well go  do him one without him knowing itstop up his ratholes” there   noble good lot  them down cellar   took us  whole hour but we done  job tight  good  shipshape then we heard steps   stairs  blowed out our light  hid  here comes  old man   candle  one hand   bundle  stuff  tother looking  absentminded  year before last he went  mooning around first  one rathole  then another till hed been  them all then  stood about five minutes picking tallowdrip off  his candle  thinking then  turns off slow  dreamy towards  stairs saying “well   life  me i cant remember when i done it i could show her now  i warnt  blame  account   rats but never mindlet  go i reckon  wouldnt do no good” and so  went  amumbling up stairs  then we left he   mighty nice old man and always is tom   good deal bothered about what  do   spoon but  said wed got  have it so  took  think when  had ciphered  out  told me how we   do then we went  waited around  spoonbasket till we see aunt sally coming  then tom went  counting  spoons  laying them out  one side  i slid one  them up my sleeve  tom says “why aunt sally there aint but nine spoons yet” she says “go long  your play  dont bother me i know better i counted m myself” “well ive counted them twice aunty  i cant make but nine” she looked out  all patience but  course she come  countanybody would “i declare  gracious ther aint but nine” she says “why what   worldplague take  things ill count m again” so i slipped back  one i had  when she got done counting she says “hang  troublesome rubbage thers ten now”  she looked huffy  bothered both but tom says “why aunty i dont think theres ten” “you numskull didnt you see me count m” “i know but” “well ill count m again” so i smouched one  they come out nine same   other time well she was   tearing wayjust atrembling all over she  so mad but she counted  counted till she got  addled shed start  count   basket   spoon sometimes  so three times they come out right  three times they come out wrong then she grabbed up  basket  slammed  across  house  knocked  cat galleywest  she said cler out  let her have some peace  if we come bothering around her again betwixt   dinner shed skin us so we had  odd spoon  dropped   her apronpocket whilst she  agiving us our sailing orders  jim got  all right along  her shingle nail before noon we  very well satisfied  this business  tom allowed   worth twice  trouble  took because  said now she couldnt ever count them spoons twice alike again  save her life  wouldnt believe shed counted them right if she did  said  after shed about counted her head off   next three days  judged shed give  up  offer  kill anybody  wanted her  ever count them any more so we put  sheet back   line  night  stole one out  her closet  kept  putting  back  stealing  again   couple  days till she didnt know how many sheets she had any more  she didnt care  warnt agoing  bullyrag  rest  her soul out about it  wouldnt count them again not  save her life she druther die first so we  all right now    shirt   sheet   spoon   candles   help   calf   rats   mixedup counting     candlestick  warnt no consequence  would blow over   by but  pie   job we had no end  trouble   pie we fixed  up away down   woods  cooked  there  we got  done  last  very satisfactory too but not all  one day  we had  use up three washpans full  flour before we got through  we got burnt pretty much all over  places  eyes put out   smoke because you see we didnt want nothing but  crust  we couldnt prop  up right  she would always cave in but  course we thought   right way  lastwhich   cook  ladder too   pie so then we laid   jim  second night  tore up  sheet all  little strings  twisted them together  long before daylight we had  lovely rope  you could  hung  person with we let   took nine months  make it and   forenoon we took  down   woods but  wouldnt go into  pie being made   whole sheet  way there  rope enough  forty pies if wed  wanted them  plenty left over  soup or sausage or anything you choose we could  had  whole dinner but we didnt need it all we needed  just enough   pie  so we throwed  rest away we didnt cook none   pies   washpanafraid  solder would melt but uncle silas  had  noble brass warmingpan which  thought considerable of because  belonged  one  his ancesters   long wooden handle  come over  england  william  conqueror   mayflower or one  them early ships   hid away up garret   lot  other old pots  things   valuable

know nothing what im talking about  lay him  enough stomachache  last him till next time too nat didnt look when we put  witch pie  jims pan  we put  three tin plates   bottom   pan under  vittles  so jim got everything all right   soon     himself  busted into  pie  hid  rope ladder inside  his straw tick  scratched some marks   tin plate  throwed  out   windowhole chapter xxxviii making them pens   distressid tough job  so   saw  jim allowed  inscription  going    toughest  all thats  one which  prisoner   scrabble   wall but  had  have it tom said hed got to there warnt no case   state

bet hell have one before  goes out  thisbecause hes going out right  there aint going   no flaws  his record” so whilst me  jim filed away   pens   brickbat apiece jim amaking hisn out   brass  i making mine out   spoon tom set  work  think out  coat  arms by    said hed struck so many good ones  didnt hardly know which  take but there  one which  reckoned hed decide on he says “on  scutcheon

but hes got  have it all  nobility does” that  just his way if  didnt suit him  explain  thing  you  wouldnt do it you might pump  him  week  wouldnt make no difference hed got all  coat  arms business fixed so now  started   finish up  rest   part   work which   plan out  mournful inscriptionsaid jim got  have one like they all done he made up  lot  wrote them out   paper  read them off so  here  captive heart busted  here  poor prisoner forsook   world  friends fretted his sorrowful life  here  lonely heart broke   worn spirit went   rest after thirtyseven years  solitary captivity  here homeless  friendless after thirtyseven years  bitter captivity perished  noble stranger natural son  louis xiv toms voice trembled whilst   reading them   most broke down when  got done  couldnt no way make up his mind which one  jim  scrabble    wall they  all so good but  last  allowed  would let him scrabble them all on jim said  would take him  year  scrabble such  lot  truck    logs   nail   didnt know how  make letters besides but tom said  would block them out  him  then  wouldnt have nothing  do but just follow  lines then pretty soon  says “come  think  logs aint agoing  do they dont have log walls   dungeon we got  dig  inscriptions into  rock well fetch  rock” jim said  rock  worse than  logs  said  would take him such  pison long time  dig them into  rock  wouldnt ever get out but tom said  would let me help him do it then  took  look  see how me  jim  getting along   pens it  most pesky tedious hard work  slow  didnt give my hands no show  get well   sores  we didnt seem  make no headway hardly so tom says “i know how  fix it we got  have  rock   coat  arms  mournful inscriptions  we can kill two birds   same rock theres  gaudy big grindstone down   mill  well smouch it  carve  things  it  file out  pens   saw  it too” it warnt no slouch   idea   warnt no slouch   grindstone nuther but we allowed wed tackle it it warnt quite midnight yet so we cleared out   mill leaving jim  work we smouched  grindstone  set out  roll her home but    most nation tough job sometimes do what we could we couldnt keep her  falling over  she come mighty near mashing us every time tom said she  going  get one  us sure before we got through we got her half way  then we  plumb played out  most drownded  sweat we see  warnt no use we got  go  fetch jim so  raised up his

cabins  drop one private  jims coffeepot   morning jim said  would “jis s soon have tobacker  his coffee”  found so much fault  it    work  bother  raising  mullen  jewsharping  rats  petting  flattering up  snakes  spiders  things  top  all  other work  had  do  pens  inscriptions  journals  things which made  more trouble  worry  responsibility    prisoner than anything  ever undertook  tom most lost all patience  him  said   just loadened down  more gaudier chances than  prisoner ever had   world  make  name  himself  yet  didnt know enough  appreciate them  they  just about wasted  him so jim   sorry  said  wouldnt behave so no more  then me  tom shoved  bed chapter xxxix in  morning we went up   village  bought  wire rattrap  fetched  down  unstopped  best rathole   about  hour we had fifteen   bulliest kind  ones  then we took   put    safe place under aunt sallys bed but while we  gone  spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found  there  opened  door    see if  rats would come out  they did  aunt sally she come in  when we got back she  astanding  top   bed raising cain   rats  doing what they could  keep off  dull times  her so she took  dusted us both   hickry  we   much  two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen drat  meddlesome cub  they warnt  likeliest nuther because  first haul   pick   flock i never see  likelier lot  rats than what  first haul was we got  splendid stock  sorted spiders  bugs  frogs  caterpillars  one thing or another  we like  got  hornets nest but we didnt the family   home we didnt give  right up but stayed  them  long  we could because we allowed wed tire them out or theyd got  tire us out  they done it then we got allycumpain  rubbed   places   pretty near all right again but couldnt set down convenient and so we went   snakes  grabbed  couple  dozen garters  housesnakes  put them   bag  put   our room    time   suppertime   rattling good honest days work  hungryoh no i reckon not and there warnt  blessed snake up there when we went backwe didnt half tie  sack  they worked out somehow  left but  didnt matter much because they  still   premises somewheres so we judged we could get some  them again no there warnt no real scarcity  snakes about  house   considerable spell youd see them dripping   rafters  places every now  then  they generly landed  your plate or down  back  your neck  most   time where you didnt want them well they  handsome  striped  there warnt no harm   million  them but  never made no difference  aunt sally she despised snakes   breed what they might  she couldnt stand them no way you could fix it  every time one  them flopped down  her  didnt make no difference what she  doing she would just lay  work down  light out i never see such  woman and you could hear her whoop  jericho you couldnt get her  take aholt  one  them   tongs and if she turned over  found one  bed she would scramble out  lift  howl  you would think  house  afire she disturbed  old man so   said  could most wish there hadnt ever been no snakes created why after every last snake had been gone clear out   house   much   week aunt sally warnt over  yet she warnt near over it when she  setting thinking about something you could touch her   back  her neck   feather  she would jump right out  her stockings it  very curious but tom said all women  just so he said they  made  way  some reason or other we got  licking every time one  our snakes come  her way  she allowed these lickings warnt nothing  what she would do if we ever loaded up  place again  them i didnt mind  lickings because they didnt amount  nothing but i minded  trouble we had  lay  another lot but we got them laid in  all  other things  you never see  cabin  blithesome  jims  when theyd all swarm out  music  go  him jim didnt like  spiders   spiders didnt like jim  so theyd lay  him  make  mighty warm  him and  said  between  rats   snakes   grindstone there warnt no room  bed  him skasely  when there was  body couldnt sleep   so lively    always lively  said because they never all slept  one time but took turn about so when  snakes  asleep  rats   deck  when  rats turned   snakes come  watch so  always had one gang under him  his way  tother gang having  circus over him  if  got up  hunt  new place  spiders would take  chance  him   crossed over he said if  ever got out this time  wouldnt ever   prisoner again not   salary well   end  three weeks everything   pretty good shape the shirt  sent  early   pie  every time  rat bit jim  would get up  write  little  his journal whilst  ink  fresh  pens  made  inscriptions  so   all carved   grindstone  bedleg  sawed  two  we had et up  sawdust   give us  most amazing stomachache we reckoned we  all going  die but didnt it   most undigestible sawdust i ever see  tom said  same but  i  saying wed got all  work done now  last  we  all pretty much fagged out too but mainly jim the old man had wrote  couple  times   plantation below orleans  come  get their runaway nigger but hadnt got no answer because there warnt no such plantation so  allowed  would advertise jim   st louis  new orleans papers  when  mentioned  st louis ones  give me  cold shivers  i see we hadnt no time  lose so tom said now   nonnamous letters “whats them” i says “warnings   people  something  up sometimes its done one way sometimes another but theres always somebody spying around  gives notice   governor   castle when louis xvi  going  light out   tooleries  servantgirl done it its  very good way  so   nonnamous letters well use them both and its usual   prisoners mother  change clothes  him  she stays in   slides out  her clothes well do that too” “but looky here tom what do we want  warn anybody   somethings up let them find  out  themselvesits their lookout” “yes i know but you cant depend  them its  way theyve acted   very startleft us  do everything theyre so confiding  mulletheaded they dont take notice  nothing  all so if we dont give them notice there wont  nobody nor nothing  interfere  us  so after all our hard work  trouble this escape ll go off perfectly flat wont amount  nothingwont  nothing to it” “well   me tom thats  way id like” “shucks”  says  looked disgusted so i says “but i aint going  make no complaint any way  suits you suits me what you going  do about  servantgirl” “youll  her you slide in   middle   night  hook  yaller girls frock” “why tom  ll make trouble next morning because  course she probbly haint got any but  one” “i know but you dont want  but fifteen minutes  carry  nonnamous letter  shove  under  front door” “all right then ill do it but i could carry  just  handy  my own togs” “you wouldnt look like  servantgirl then would you” “no but there wont  nobody  see what i look like anyway” “that aint got nothing  do  it the thing  us  do  just  do our duty  not worry about whether anybody sees us do  or not haint you got no principle  all” “all right i aint saying nothing im  servantgirl whos jims mother” “im his mother ill hook  gown  aunt sally” “well then youll have  stay   cabin when me  jim leaves” “not much ill stuff jims clothes full  straw  lay   his bed  represent his mother  disguise  jim ll take  nigger womans gown off  me  wear it  well all evade together when  prisoner  style escapes its called  evasion its always called so when  king escapes frinstance and  same   kings son  dont make no difference whether hes  natural one or  unnatural one” so tom  wrote  nonnamous letter  i smouched  yaller wenchs frock  night  put  on  shoved  under  front door  way tom told me to it said beware trouble  brewing keep  sharp lookout unknown friend next night we stuck  picture which tom drawed  blood   skull  crossbones   front door  next night another one   coffin

stopped us there  put his eye   crack but couldnt make out nothing   so dark  whispered  said  would listen   steps  get further  when  nudged us jim must glide out first  him last so  set his ear   crack  listened  listened  listened   steps ascraping around out there all  time   last  nudged us  we slid out  stooped down not breathing  not making  least noise  slipped stealthy towards  fence  injun file  got   all right  me  jim over it but toms britches catched fast   splinter   top rail  then  hear  steps coming so  had  pull loose which snapped  splinter  made  noise    dropped  our tracks  started somebody sings out “whos that answer or ill shoot” but we didnt answer we just unfurled our heels  shoved then there   rush   bang bang bang   bullets fairly whizzed around us we heard them sing out “here they are theyve broke   river after em boys  turn loose  dogs” so here they come full tilt we could hear them because they wore boots  yelled but we didnt wear no boots  didnt yell we    path   mill  when they got pretty close   us we dodged into  bush  let them go by  then dropped  behind them theyd had all  dogs shut up so they wouldnt scare off  robbers but  this time somebody had let them loose  here they come making powwow enough   million but they  our dogs so we stopped  our tracks till they catched up  when they see  warnt nobody but us  no excitement  offer them they only just said howdy  tore right ahead towards  shouting  clattering  then we upsteam again  whizzed along after them till we  nearly   mill  then struck up through  bush  where my canoe  tied  hopped   pulled  dear life towards  middle   river but didnt make no more noise than we  obleeged to then we struck out easy  comfortable   island where my raft was  we could hear them yelling  barking  each other all up  down  bank till we  so far away  sounds got dim  died out and when we stepped    raft i says “now old jim youre  free man again  i bet you wont ever   slave no more” “en  mighty good job  wuz too huck it uz planned beautiful en  uz done beautiful en dey aint nobody kin git up  plan dats mo mixedup en splendid den what dat one wuz” we  all glad  we could be but tom   gladdest  all because  had  bullet   calf  his leg when me  jim heard  we didnt feel so brash  what we did before it  hurting him considerable  bleeding so we laid him   wigwam  tore up one   dukes shirts   bandage him but  says “gimme  rags i can do  myself dont stop now dont fool around here   evasion booming along so handsome man  sweeps  set her loose boys we done  elegantdeed we did i wish

row about it but me  jim stuck    wouldnt budge so    crawling out  setting  raft loose himself but we wouldnt let him then  give us  piece  his mind but  didnt do no good so when  sees me getting  canoe ready  says “well then if youre bound  go ill tell you  way  do when you get   village shut  door  blindfold  doctor tight  fast  make him swear   silent   grave  put  purse full  gold  his hand

 long time  said what  splendid boy sid was  didnt seem  want  ever stop talking about him  kept asking me every now  then if i reckoned  could  got lost or hurt or maybe drownded  might  laying  this

her hand  she  asleep chapter xlii the old man  uptown again before breakfast but couldnt get no track  tom  both  them set   table thinking  not saying nothing  looking mournful  their coffee getting cold  not eating anything and     old man says “did i give you  letter” “what letter” “the one i got yesterday out   postoffice” “no you didnt give me no letter” “well i must  forgot it” so  rummaged his pockets  then went off somewheres where  had laid  down  fetched it  give   her she says “why its  st petersburgits  sis” i allowed another walk would do me good but i couldnt stir but before she

thing  come handy  rushed she flung herself  tom crying  says “oh hes dead hes dead i know hes dead” and tom  turned his head  little  muttered something or other which showed  warnt  his right mind then she flung up her hands  says “hes alive thank god and thats enough”  she snatched  kiss  him  flew   house  get  bed ready  scattering orders right  left   niggers  everybody else  fast  her tongue could go every jump   way i followed  men  see what they  going  do  jim   old doctor  uncle silas followed after tom into  house the men  very huffy  some  them wanted  hang jim   example  all  other niggers around there so they wouldnt  trying  run away like jim done  making such  raft  trouble  keeping  whole family scared most  death  days  nights but  others said dont do it  wouldnt answer  all  aint our nigger  his owner would turn up  make us pay  him sure so  cooled them down  little because  people thats always  most anxious   hang  nigger  haint done just right  always  very ones  aint  most anxious  pay  him when theyve got their satisfaction out  him they cussed jim considerble though  give him  cuff or two side  head once   while but jim never said nothing   never let

nothing but bread  water  eat after this till his owner come or   sold  auction because  didnt come   certain length  time  filled up our hole  said  couple  farmers  guns must stand watch around about  cabin every night   bulldog tied   door   daytime  about this time they  through   job   tapering off   kind  generl goodbye cussing  then  old doctor comes  takes  look  says “dont  no rougher

worse   little worse  after  long time  went out  his head  wouldnt let me come anigh him any more  said if i chalked his raft hed kill me  no end  wild foolishness like that  i see i couldnt do anything  all  him so i says i got  have help somehow   minute i says  out crawls this nigger  somewheres  says hell help   done it too  done  very well of course i judged  must   runaway nigger  there i was  there i had  stick right straight along all  rest   day  all night it   fix i tell you i had  couple  patients   chills   course id  liked  run up  town  see them but i dasnt because  nigger might get away  then id   blame  yet never  skiff come close enough  me  hail so there i had  stick plumb until daylight this morning  i never see  nigger    better nuss or faithfuller  yet   risking his freedom  do it   all tired out too  i see plain enough hed been worked main hard lately i liked  nigger  that i tell you gentlemen  nigger like   worth  thousand dollarsand kind treatment too i had everything i needed   boy  doing  well there   would  done  homebetter maybe because   so quiet but there i was  both  m  my hands  there i had  stick till about dawn this morning then some

start he aint no bad nigger gentlemen thats what i think about him” somebody says “well  sounds very good doctor im obleeged  say” then  others softened up  little too  i  mighty thankful   old doctor  doing jim  good turn  i  glad   according  my judgment  him too because i thought  had  good heart  him    good man  first time i see him then they all agreed  jim had acted very well   deserving  have some notice took  it  reward so every one  them promised right out  hearty  they wouldnt cuss him no more then they come out  locked him up i hoped they  going  say  could have one or two   chains took off because they  rotten heavy or could have meat  greens  his bread  water but they didnt think  it  i reckoned  warnt best  me  mix in but i judged id get  doctors yarn  aunt sally

hunting  runaway nigger but i had plenty time aunt sally she stuck   sickroom all day  all night  every time i see uncle silas mooning around i dodged him next morning i heard tom   good deal better  they said aunt sally  gone  get  nap so i slips   sickroom  if i found him awake i reckoned we could put up  yarn   family  would wash but   sleeping  sleeping very peaceful too  pale not firefaced  way   when  come so i set down  laid  him  wake in about half  hour aunt sally comes gliding in  there i was up  stump again she motioned me   still  set down  me  begun  whisper  said we could all

ourselves  wasnt  bully aunty” “well i never heard  likes    all my born days so   you you little rapscallions thats been making all this trouble  turned everybodys wits clean inside out  scared us all most  death ive  good  notion  ever i had  my life  take  out o you this very minute to think here ive been night after night ayou just get well once you young scamp  i lay ill tan  old harry out o both o ye” but tom  was so proud  joyful  just couldnt hold in  his tongue just went itshe achipping in  spitting fire all along  both  them going   once like  cat convention  she says “well you get all  enjoyment you can out   now  mind i tell you if i catch you meddling  him again” “meddling  who” tom says dropping his smile  looking surprised “with who why  runaway nigger  course whod you reckon” tom looks  me very grave  says “tom didnt you just tell me   all right hasnt  got away” “him” says aunt sally “the runaway nigger deed  hasnt theyve got him back safe  sound  hes   cabin again  bread  water  loaded down  chains till hes claimed or sold” tom rose square up  bed  his eye hot  his nostrils opening  shutting like gills  sings out  me “they haint no right  shut him up shoveand dont you lose  minute turn him loose  aint no slave hes  free  any cretur  walks this earth” “what does  child mean” “i mean every word i say aunt sally  if somebody dont go ill go ive knowed him all his life  so  tom there old miss watson died two months ago  she  ashamed she ever  going  sell him down  river  said so  she set him free  her will” “then what  earth did you want  set him free for seeing   already free” “well  is  question i must say  just like women why i wanted  adventure  it  id  waded neckdeep  blood togoodness alive aunt polly” if she warnt standing right there just inside  door looking  sweet  contented   angel half full  pie i wish i may never aunt sally jumped  her  most hugged  head off  her  cried over her  i found  good enough place  me under  bed    getting pretty sultry  us seemed  me and i peeped out    little while toms aunt polly shook herself loose  stood there looking across  tom over her spectacleskind  grinding him into  earth you know and then she says “yes you better turn yr head awayi would if i  you tom” “oh deary me” says aunt sally “is  changed so why  aint tom its sid tomstomswhy where  tom he  here  minute ago” “you mean wheres huck finnthats what you mean i reckon i haint raised such  scamp  my tom all these years not  know him when i see him that would   pretty howdydo come out  under  bed huck finn” so i done it but not feeling brash aunt sally she  one   mixedupestlooking persons i ever seeexcept one    uncle silas when  come   they told  all  him it kind  made him drunk  you may say   didnt know nothing  all  rest   day  preached  prayermeeting sermon  night  gave him  rattling ruputation because  oldest man   world couldnt  understood it so toms aunt polly she told all about who i was  what  i had  up  tell how i   such  tight place  when mrs phelps took me  tom sawyershe chipped   says “oh go   call me aunt sally im used   now  taint no need  change”that when aunt sally took me  tom sawyer i had  stand itthere warnt no other way  i knowed  wouldnt mind because  would  nuts  him being  mystery  hed make  adventure out  it   perfectly satisfied and so  turned out   let    sid  made things  soft   could  me and his aunt polly she said tom  right about old miss watson setting jim free  her will  so sure enough tom sawyer had gone  took all  trouble  bother  set  free nigger free  i couldnt ever understand before until  minute   talk how  could help  body set  nigger free  his bringingup well aunt polly she said  when aunt sally wrote  her  tom  sid had come all right  safe she says  herself “look  that now i might have expected it letting him go off  way without anybody  watch him so now i got  go  trapse all  way down  river eleven hundred mile  find out what  creeturs up  this time  long  i couldnt seem  get any answer out  you about it” “why i never heard nothing  you” says aunt sally “well i wonder why i wrote you twice  ask you what you could mean  sid being here” “well i never got em sis” aunt polly she turns around slow  severe  says “you tom” “wellwhat”  says kind  pettish “dont you what me you impudent thinghand out them letters” “what letters” “them letters i  bound if i have  take aholt  you ill” “theyre   trunk there now and theyre just  same  they  when i got them out   office i haint looked into them i haint touched them but i knowed theyd make trouble  i thought if you warnt  no hurry id” “well you do need skinning there aint no mistake about it and i wrote another one  tell you i  coming  i spose he” “no  come yesterday i haint read  yet but its all right ive got  one” i wanted  offer  bet two dollars she hadnt but i reckoned maybe   just  safe  not to so i never said nothing chapter the last the first time i catched tom private i asked him what  his idea time   evasionwhat   hed planned  do if  evasion worked all right   managed  set  nigger free   already free before and  said what  had planned  his head   start if we got jim out all

get out all  niggers around  have them waltz him into town   torchlight procession   brassband  then  would   hero  so would we but i reckoned   about  well  way  was we had jim out   chains  no time  when aunt polly  uncle silas  aunt sally found out how good  helped  doctor nurse tom they made  heap  fuss over him  fixed him up prime  give him all  wanted  eat   good time  nothing  do and we had
