think  mrs pontellier  capricious” said madame lebrun who  amusing herself immensely  feared  edna’s abrupt departure might put  end   pleasure “i know she is” assented mr pontellier “sometimes not often” edna had not traversed  quarter   distance  her way home before she  overtaken  robert “did you think i  afraid” she asked him without  shade  annoyance “no i knew you weren’t afraid” “then why did you come why didn’t you stay out there   others” “i never thought  it” “thought  what” “of anything what difference does  make” “i’m very tired” she uttered complainingly “i know you are” “you don’t know anything about it why should you know i never  so exhausted  my life but  isn’t unpleasant a thousand emotions have swept through me tonight i don’t comprehend half  them don’t mind what

“yes on  twentyeighth  august   hour  midnight  if  moon  shining—the moon must  shining—a spirit   haunted these shores  ages rises up   gulf with  own penetrating vision  spirit seeks some one mortal worthy  hold him company worthy  being exalted   few hours into realms   semicelestials his search  always hitherto been fruitless    sunk back disheartened into  sea but tonight  found mrs

his flippancy he did not mind  entreaty but  tone   delicate note  pathos  like  reproach he could not explain  could not tell her   had penetrated her mood  understood he said nothing except  offer her his arm for  her own admission she  exhausted she had been walking alone  her arms hanging limp letting her white skirts trail along  dewy path she took his arm but she did not lean upon it she let her hand lie listlessly  though her thoughts  elsewhere—somewhere  advance  her body  she  striving  overtake them robert assisted her into  hammock which swung   post before her door out   trunk   tree “will you stay out here  wait  mr pontellier”  asked “i’ll stay out here goodnight” “shall i get you  pillow” “there’s one here” she said feeling about  they    shadow “it must  soiled  children have been tumbling  about” “no matter” and having discovered  pillow she adjusted  beneath her head she extended herself   hammock   deep breath  relief she  not  supercilious or  overdainty woman she  not much given  reclining   hammock  when she did so    no catlike suggestion  voluptuous ease but   beneficent repose which seemed  invade her whole body “shall i stay  you till mr pontellier comes” asked robert seating himself   outer edge  one   steps  taking hold   hammock rope which  fastened   post “if you wish don’t swing  hammock will you get my white shawl which i left   windowsill over   house” “are you chilly” “no but i shall  presently” “presently”  laughed “do you know what time  is how long  you going  stay out here” “i don’t know will you get  shawl” “of course i will”  said rising he went over   house walking along  grass she watched his figure pass   out   strips  moonlight it  past midnight it  very quiet when  returned   shawl she took   kept   her hand she did not put  around her “did you say i should stay till mr pontellier came back” “i said you might if you wished to” he seated himself again  rolled  cigarette which  smoked  silence neither did mrs pontellier speak no multitude  words could have been more significant than those moments  silence or more pregnant   firstfelt throbbings  desire when  voices   bathers  heard approaching robert said goodnight she did not answer him he thought she  asleep again she watched his figure pass   out   strips  moonlight   walked away xi “what  you doing out here edna i thought i should find you  bed” said her husband when  discovered her lying there he had walked up  madame lebrun  left her   house his wife did not reply “are you asleep”  asked bending down close  look  her “no” her eyes gleamed bright  intense  no sleepy shadows  they looked into his “do you know   past one o’clock come on”   mounted  steps  went into their room “edna” called mr pontellier  within after  few moments had gone by “don’t wait  me” she answered he thrust his head through  door “you  take cold out there”  said irritably “what folly  this why don’t you come in” “it isn’t cold i have my shawl” “the mosquitoes  devour you” “there  no mosquitoes” she heard him moving about  room every sound indicating impatience  irritation another time she would have gone   his request she would through habit have yielded  his desire not  any sense  submission or obedience  his compelling wishes but unthinkingly  we walk move sit stand go through  daily treadmill   life which  been portioned out  us “edna dear  you not coming  soon”  asked again this time fondly   note  entreaty “no i am going  stay out here” “this  more than folly”  blurted out “i can’t permit you  stay out there all night you must come   house instantly” with  writhing motion she settled herself more securely   hammock she perceived  her  had blazed up stubborn  resistant she could not   moment have done other than denied  resisted she wondered if her husband had ever spoken  her like  before  if she had submitted  his command of course she had she remembered  she had but she could not realize why or how she should have yielded feeling  she then did “léonce go  bed” she said “i mean  stay out here i don’t wish  go in  i don’t intend to don’t speak  me like  again i shall not answer you” mr pontellier had prepared  bed but  slipped   extra garment he opened  bottle  wine  which  kept  small  select supply   buffet  his own he drank  glass   wine  went out   gallery  offered  glass  his wife she did not wish any he drew up  rocker hoisted his slippered feet   rail  proceeded  smoke  cigar he smoked two cigars then  went inside  drank another glass  wine mrs pontellier again declined  accept  glass when   offered  her mr pontellier once more seated himself  elevated feet  after  reasonable interval  time smoked some more cigars edna began  feel like one who awakens gradually out   dream  delicious grotesque impossible dream  feel again  realities pressing into her soul the physical need  sleep began  overtake her  exuberance which had sustained  exalted her spirit left her helpless  yielding   conditions which crowded her in the stillest hour   night had come  hour before dawn when  world seems  hold  breath the moon hung low  had turned  silver  copper   sleeping sky the old owl no longer hooted   wateroaks had ceased  moan  they bent their heads edna arose cramped  lying so long  still   hammock she tottered up  steps clutching feebly   post before passing into  house “are you coming in

shrimps  her bamboo basket they  covered  spanish moss she beat  moss down impatiently  muttered  herself sullenly “let us go  grande terre tomorrow” said robert   low voice “what shall we do there” “climb up  hill   old fort  look   little wriggling gold snakes  watch  lizards sun themselves” she gazed away toward grande terre  thought she would like   alone there  robert   sun listening

pontellier  sank back into his seat he whispered  anxious inquiry   lady  black who did not notice him or reply but kept her eyes fastened upon  pages  her velvet prayerbook “i felt giddy  almost overcome” edna said lifting her hands instinctively  her head  pushing her straw hat up  her forehead “i couldn’t have stayed through  service” they  outside   shadow   church robert  full  solicitude “it  folly  have thought  going   first place let alone staying come over  madame antoine’s you can rest there” he took her arm  led her away looking anxiously  continuously down into her face how still  was  only  voice   sea whispering through  reeds  grew   saltwater pools the long line  little gray weatherbeaten houses nestled peacefully among  orange trees it must always have been god’s day   low drowsy island edna thought they stopped leaning over  jagged fence made  seadrift  ask  water a youth  mildfaced acadian  drawing water   cistern which  nothing more than  rusty buoy   opening  one side sunk   ground the water which  youth handed  them   tin pail  not cold  taste but   cool  her heated face   greatly revived  refreshed her madame antoine’s cot    far end   village she welcomed them  all  native hospitality  she would have opened her door  let  sunlight in she  fat  walked heavily  clumsily across  floor she could speak no english but when robert made her

one  repose it stood   small side room which looked out across  narrow grass plot toward  shed where there   disabled boat lying keel upward madame antoine had not gone  mass her son tonie had but she supposed  would soon  back  she invited robert   seated  wait  him but  went  sat outside  door  smoked madame antoine busied herself   large front room preparing dinner she  boiling mullets over  few red coals   huge fireplace edna left alone   little side room loosened her clothes removing  greater part  them she bathed her face her neck  arms   basin  stood between  windows she took off her shoes  stockings  stretched herself   very center   high white bed how luxurious  felt  rest thus   strange quaint bed   sweet country odor  laurel lingering about  sheets  mattress she stretched her strong limbs  ached  little she ran her fingers through her loosened hair   while she looked  her round arms  she held them straight up  rubbed them one after  other observing closely  if   something she saw   first time  fine firm quality  texture  her flesh she clasped her hands easily above her head    thus she fell asleep she slept lightly  first half awake  drowsily attentive   things about her she could hear madame antoine’s heavy scraping tread  she walked back  forth   sanded floor some chickens  clucking outside  windows scratching  bits  gravel   grass later she half heard  voices  robert  tonie talking under  shed she did not stir even her eyelids rested numb  heavily over her sleepy eyes the voices went on—tonie’s slow acadian drawl robert’s quick soft smooth french she understood french imperfectly unless directly addressed   voices  only part   other drowsy muffled sounds lulling her senses when edna awoke     conviction  she had slept long  soundly the voices  hushed under  shed madame antoine’s step  no longer   heard   adjoining room even  chickens had gone elsewhere  scratch  cluck the mosquito bar  drawn over her  old woman had come  while she slept

madame antoine had laid some coarse clean towels upon  chair  had placed  box  poudre de riz within easy reach edna dabbed  powder upon her nose  cheeks  she looked  herself closely   little distorted mirror which hung   wall above  basin her eyes  bright  wide awake  her face glowed when she had completed her toilet she walked into  adjoining room she  very hungry no one  there but there   cloth spread upon  table  stood against  wall   cover  laid  one   crusty brown loaf   bottle  wine beside  plate edna bit  piece   brown loaf tearing   her strong white teeth she poured some   wine into  glass  drank  down then she went softly out  doors  plucking  orange   lowhanging bough   tree threw   robert who did not know she  awake  up an illumination broke over his whole face when  saw her  joined her under  orange tree “how many years have i slept” she inquired “the whole island seems changed a new race  beings must have sprung up leaving only you  me  past relics how many ages ago did madame antoine  tonie die  when did our people  grand isle disappear   earth” he familiarly adjusted  ruffle upon her shoulder “you have slept precisely one hundred years i  left here  guard your slumbers   one hundred years i have been out under  shed reading  book the only evil i couldn’t prevent   keep  broiled fowl  drying up” “if   turned  stone still  i eat it” said edna moving  him into  house “but really what  become  monsieur farival   others” “gone hours ago when they found  you  sleeping they thought  best not  awake you any way i wouldn’t have let them what  i here for” “i wonder if léonce   uneasy” she speculated  she seated herself  table “of course not  knows you   me” robert replied   busied himself among sundry pans  covered dishes which had been left standing   hearth “where  madame antoine  her son” asked edna “gone  vespers   visit some friends i believe i am  take you back  tonie’s boat whenever you  ready  go” he stirred  smoldering ashes till  broiled fowl began  sizzle afresh he served her  no mean repast dripping  coffee anew  sharing   her madame antoine had cooked little else than  mullets but while edna slept robert had foraged  island he  childishly gratified  discover her appetite   see  relish  which she ate  food which  had procured  her “shall we go right away” she asked after draining her glass  brushing together  crumbs   crusty loaf “the sun isn’t  low      two hours”  answered “the sun   gone  two hours” “well let  go who cares” they waited  good while under  orange trees till madame antoine came back panting waddling   thousand apologies  explain her absence tonie did not dare  return he  shy  would not willingly face any woman except his mother it  very pleasant  stay there under  orange trees while  sun dipped lower  lower turning  western sky  flaming copper  gold the shadows lengthened  crept out like stealthy grotesque monsters across  grass edna  robert both sat upon  ground—that is  lay upon  ground beside her occasionally picking   hem  her muslin gown madame antoine seated her fat body broad  squat upon  bench beside  door she had been talking all  afternoon  had wound herself up   storytelling pitch and what stories she told them but twice  her life she had left  chênière caminada  then   briefest span all her years she had squatted  waddled there upon  island gathering legends   baratarians   sea the night came on   moon  lighten it edna could hear  whispering voices  dead men   click  muffled gold when she  robert stepped into tonie’s boat   red lateen sail misty spirit forms  prowling   shadows  among  reeds  upon  water  phantom ships speeding  cover xiv the youngest boy etienne had been very naughty madame ratignolle said  she delivered him into  hands  his mother he had been unwilling  go  bed  had made  scene whereupon she had taken charge  him  pacified him  well  she could raoul had been  bed  asleep  two hours the youngster   his long white nightgown  kept tripping him up  madame ratignolle led him along   hand with  other chubby fist  rubbed his eyes which  heavy  sleep  ill humor edna took him  her arms  seating herself   rocker began  coddle  caress him calling him all manner  tender names soothing him  sleep it  not more than nine o’clock no one had yet gone  bed but  children léonce had been very uneasy  first madame ratignolle said  had wanted  start  once   chênière but monsieur farival had assured him  his wife  only overcome  sleep  fatigue  tonie would bring her safely back later   day   had thus been dissuaded  crossing  bay he had gone over  klein’s looking up some cotton broker whom  wished  see  regard  securities exchanges stocks bonds or something   sort madame ratignolle did not remember what he said  would not remain away late she herself  suffering  heat  oppression she said she carried  bottle  salts   large fan she would not consent  remain  edna  monsieur ratignolle  alone   detested above all things   left alone when etienne had fallen asleep edna bore him into  back room  robert went  lifted  mosquito bar  she might lay  child comfortably  his bed the quadroon had vanished when they emerged   cottage robert bade edna goodnight “do you know we have been together  whole livelong day robert—since early this morning” she said  parting “all but  hundred years when you  sleeping goodnight” he pressed her hand  went away   direction   beach he did not join any   others but walked alone toward  gulf edna stayed outside awaiting her husband’s return she had no desire  sleep or  retire nor did she feel like going over  sit   ratignolles or  join madame lebrun   group whose animated voices reached her  they sat  conversation before  house she let her mind wander back over her stay  grand isle  she tried  discover wherein this summer had been different  any  every other summer  her life she could only realize  she herself—her present self—was  some way different   other self that she  seeing  different eyes  making  acquaintance  new conditions  herself  colored  changed her environment she did not yet suspect she wondered why robert had gone away  left her it did not occur  her  think  might have grown tired  being  her  livelong day she  not tired  she felt    not she regretted   had gone it  so much more natural  have him stay when   not absolutely required  leave her as edna waited  her husband she sang low  little song  robert had sung  they crossed  bay it began  “ah si tu savais”  every verse ended  “si tu savais” robert’s voice  not pretentious it  musical  true the voice  notes  whole refrain haunted her memory xv when edna entered  diningroom one evening  little late   her habit  unusually animated conversation seemed   going on several persons  talking  once  victor’s voice  predominating even over   his mother edna had returned late  her bath had dressed  some haste  her face  flushed her head set off  her dainty white gown suggested  rich rare blossom she took her seat  table between old monsieur farival  madame ratignolle as she seated herself   about  begin  eat her soup which had been served when she entered  room several persons informed her simultaneously  robert  going  mexico she laid her spoon down  looked about her bewildered he had been  her reading  her all  morning  had never even mentioned such  place  mexico she had not seen him during  afternoon she had heard some one say     house upstairs  his mother this she had thought nothing of though she  surprised when  did not join her later   afternoon when she went down   beach she looked across  him where  sat beside madame lebrun who presided edna’s face   blank picture  bewilderment which she never thought  disguising he lifted his eyebrows   pretext   smile   returned her glance he looked embarrassed  uneasy “when   going” she asked  everybody  general  if robert  not there  answer  himself “tonight” “this very evening” “did you ever” “what possesses him”  some   replies she gathered uttered simultaneously  french  english “impossible” she exclaimed “how can  person start off  grand isle  mexico   moment’s notice  if   going over  klein’s or   wharf or down   beach” “i said all along i  going  mexico i’ve been saying so  years” cried robert   excited  irritable tone   air   man defending himself against  swarm  stinging insects madame lebrun knocked   table  her knife handle “please let robert explain why   going  why   going tonight” she called out “really this table  getting   more  more like bedlam every day  everybody talking  once sometimes—i hope god  forgive me—but positively sometimes i wish victor would lose  power  speech” victor laughed sardonically   thanked his mother  her holy wish  which  failed  see  benefit  anybody except   might afford her  more ample opportunity  license  talk herself monsieur farival thought  victor should have been taken out  midocean  his earliest youth  drowned victor thought there would  more logic  thus disposing  old people   established claim  making themselves universally obnoxious madame lebrun grew  trifle hysterical robert called his brother some sharp hard names “there’s nothing much  explain mother”  said though  explained nevertheless—looking chiefly  edna—that  could only meet  gentleman whom  intended  join  vera cruz  taking such  such  steamer which left new orleans  such  day  beaudelet  going out  his luggerload  vegetables  night which gave him  opportunity  reaching  city  making his vessel  time “but when did you make up your mind  all this” demanded monsieur farival “this afternoon” returned robert   shade  annoyance “at what time this afternoon” persisted  old gentleman  nagging determination  if   crossquestioning  criminal   court  justice “at four o’clock this afternoon monsieur farival” robert replied   high voice    lofty air which reminded edna  some gentleman   stage she had forced herself  eat most  her soup  now she  picking  flaky bits   court bouillon  her fork the lovers  profiting   general conversation  mexico  speak  whispers  matters which they rightly considered  interesting  no one but themselves the lady  black had once received  pair  prayerbeads  curious workmanship  mexico  very special indulgence attached  them but she had never been able  ascertain whether  indulgence extended outside  mexican border father fochel   cathedral had attempted  explain it but  had not done so  her satisfaction and she begged  robert would interest himself  discover if possible whether she  entitled   indulgence accompanying  remarkably curious mexican prayerbeads madame ratignolle hoped  robert would exercise extreme caution  dealing   mexicans who she considered   treacherous people unscrupulous  revengeful she trusted she did them no injustice  thus condemning them   race she had known personally but one mexican who made  sold excellent tamales  whom she would have trusted implicitly so softspoken  he one day   arrested  stabbing his wife she never knew whether  had been hanged or not victor had grown hilarious   attempting  tell  anecdote about  mexican girl who served chocolate one winter   restaurant  dauphine street no one would listen  him but old monsieur farival who went into convulsions over  droll story edna wondered if they had all gone mad   talking  clamoring   rate she herself could think  nothing  say about mexico or  mexicans “at what time do you leave” she asked robert “at ten”  told her “beaudelet wants  wait   moon” “are you all ready  go” “quite ready i shall only take  handbag  shall pack my trunk   city” he turned  answer some question put  him  his mother  edna having finished her black coffee left  table she went directly  her room the little cottage  close  stuffy after leaving  outer air but she did not mind there appeared    hundred different things demanding her attention indoors she began  set  toiletstand  rights grumbling   negligence   quadroon who    adjoining room putting  children  bed she gathered together stray garments   hanging   backs  chairs  put each where  belonged  closet or bureau drawer she changed her gown   more comfortable  commodious wrapper she rearranged her hair combing  brushing   unusual energy then she went   assisted  quadroon  getting  boys  bed they  very playful  inclined  talk—to do anything but lie quiet  go  sleep edna sent  quadroon away  her supper  told her she need not return then she sat  told  children  story instead  soothing  excited them  added  their wakefulness she left them  heated argument speculating about  conclusion   tale which their mother promised  finish  following night the little black girl came   say  madame lebrun would like  have mrs pontellier go  sit  them over   house till mr robert went away edna returned answer  she had already undressed  she did not feel quite well but perhaps she would go over   house later she started  dress again  got  far advanced   remove her peignoir but changing her mind once more she resumed  peignoir  went outside  sat down before her door she  overheated  irritable  fanned herself energetically   while madame ratignolle came down  discover what   matter “all  noise  confusion   table must have upset me” replied edna “and moreover i hate shocks  surprises the idea  robert starting off  such  ridiculously sudden  dramatic way as if    matter  life  death never saying  word about  all morning when    me” “yes” agreed madame ratignolle “i think   showing us all—you especially—very little consideration it wouldn’t have surprised me  any   others those lebruns  all given  heroics but i must say i should never have expected such  thing  robert are you not coming down come on dear  doesn’t look friendly” “no” said edna  little sullenly “i can’t go   trouble  dressing again i don’t feel like it” “you needn’t dress you look all right fasten  belt around your waist just look  me” “no” persisted edna “but you go on madame lebrun might  offended if we both stayed away” madame ratignolle kissed edna goodnight  went away being  truth rather desirous  joining   general  animated conversation which  still  progress concerning mexico   mexicans somewhat later robert came up carrying his handbag “aren’t you feeling well”  asked “oh well enough are you going right away” he lit  match  looked  his watch “in twenty minutes”  said the sudden  brief flare   match emphasized  darkness   while he sat down upon  stool which  children had left out   porch “get  chair” said edna “this  do”  replied he put  his soft hat  nervously took  off again  wiping his face  his handkerchief complained   heat “take  fan” said edna offering   him “oh no thank you it does no good you have  stop fanning some time  feel all  more uncomfortable afterward” “that’s one   ridiculous things which men always say i have never known one  speak otherwise  fanning how long  you  gone” “forever perhaps i don’t know it depends upon  good many things” “well  case  shouldn’t  forever how long   be” “i don’t know” “this seems  me perfectly preposterous  uncalled for i don’t like it i don’t understand your motive  silence  mystery never saying  word  me about  this morning” he remained silent not offering  defend himself he only said after  moment “don’t part  me  any ill humor i never knew you   out  patience  me before” “i don’t want  part  any ill humor” she said “but can’t you understand i’ve grown used  seeing you  having you  me all  time  your action seems unfriendly even unkind you don’t even offer  excuse  it why i  planning   together thinking  how pleasant  would   see you   city next winter” “so  i”  blurted “perhaps that’s the—” he stood up suddenly  held out his hand “goodby my dear mrs pontellier goodby you won’t—i hope you won’t completely forget me” she clung  his hand striving  detain him “write  me when you get there won’t you robert” she entreated “i will thank you goodby” how unlike robert the merest acquaintance would have said something more emphatic than “i will thank you goodby”  such  request he had evidently already taken leave   people over   house   descended  steps  went  join beaudelet who  out there   oar across his shoulder waiting  robert they walked away   darkness she could only hear beaudelet’s voice robert had apparently not even spoken  word  greeting  his companion edna bit her handkerchief convulsively striving  hold back   hide even  herself  she would have hidden  another  emotion which  troubling—tearing—her her eyes  brimming  tears for  first time she recognized  symptoms  infatuation which she had felt incipiently   child   girl  her earliest teens  later   young woman the recognition did not lessen  reality  poignancy   revelation  any

mademoiselle reisz one morning  she came creeping up behind edna who had just left her cottage  her way   beach she spent much  her time   water since she had acquired finally  art  swimming as their stay  grand isle drew near  close she felt  she could not give too much time   diversion which afforded her  only real pleasurable moments  she knew when mademoiselle reisz came  touched her upon  shoulder  spoke  her  woman seemed  echo  thought which  ever  edna’s mind or better  feeling which constantly possessed her robert’s going had some way taken  brightness  color  meaning out  everything the conditions  her life   no way changed but her whole existence  dulled like  faded garment which seems   no longer worth wearing she sought him everywhere—in others whom she induced  talk about him she went up   mornings  madame lebrun’s room braving  clatter   old sewingmachine she sat there  chatted  intervals  robert had done she gazed around  room   pictures  photographs hanging upon  wall  discovered  some corner  old family album which she examined   keenest interest appealing  madame lebrun  enlightenment concerning  many figures  faces which she discovered between  pages there   picture  madame lebrun  robert   baby seated  her lap  roundfaced infant   fist  his mouth the eyes alone   baby suggested  man and    also  kilts   age  five wearing long curls  holding  whip  his hand it made edna laugh  she laughed too   portrait  his first long trousers while another interested her taken when  left  college looking thin longfaced  eyes full  fire ambition  great intentions but there  no recent picture none which suggested  robert who had gone away five days ago leaving  void  wilderness behind him “oh robert stopped having his pictures taken when  had  pay  them himself he found wiser use  his money  says” explained madame lebrun she had  letter  him written before  left new orleans edna wished  see  letter  madame lebrun told her  look   either   table or  dresser or perhaps     mantelpiece the letter    bookshelf it possessed  greatest interest  attraction  edna  envelope  size  shape  postmark  handwriting she examined every detail   outside before opening it there  only  few lines setting forth   would leave  city  afternoon   had packed his trunk  good shape    well  sent her his love  begged   affectionately remembered  all there  no special message  edna except  postscript saying  if mrs pontellier desired  finish  book which  had been reading  her his mother would find   his room among other books there   table edna experienced  pang  jealousy because  had written  his mother rather than  her every one seemed  take  granted  she missed him even her husband when  came down  saturday following robert’s departure expressed regret   had gone “how do you get  without him edna”  asked “it’s very dull without him” she admitted mr pontellier had seen robert   city  edna asked him  dozen questions or more where had they met on carondelet street   morning they had gone “in”  had  drink   cigar together what had they talked about chiefly about his prospects  mexico which mr pontellier thought  promising how did  look how did  seem—grave or gay or how quite cheerful  wholly taken up   idea  his trip which mr pontellier found altogether natural   young fellow about  seek fortune  adventure   strange queer country edna tapped her foot impatiently  wondered why  children persisted  playing   sun when they might  under  trees she went down  led them out   sun scolding  quadroon  not being more attentive it did not strike her    least grotesque  she should  making  robert  object  conversation  leading her husband  speak  him the sentiment which she entertained  robert  no way resembled  which she felt  her husband or had ever felt or ever expected  feel she had all her life long been accustomed  harbor thoughts  emotions which never voiced themselves they had never taken  form  struggles they belonged  her   her own  she entertained  conviction  she had  right  them   they concerned no one but herself edna had once told madame ratignolle  she would never sacrifice herself  her children or  any one then had followed  rather heated argument  two women did not appear  understand each other or   talking  same language edna tried  appease her friend  explain “i would give up  unessential i would give my money i would give my life  my children but i wouldn’t give myself i can’t make  more clear it’s only something which i am beginning  comprehend which  revealing itself  me” “i don’t know what you would call  essential or what you mean   unessential” said madame ratignolle cheerfully “but  woman who would give her life  her children could do no more than that—your bible tells you so i’m sure i couldn’t do more than that” “oh yes you could” laughed edna she  not surprised  mademoiselle reisz’s question  morning  lady following her   beach tapped her   shoulder  asked if she did not greatly miss her young friend “oh good morning mademoiselle   you why  course i miss robert are you going down  bathe” “why should i go down  bathe   very end   season when i haven’t been   surf all summer” replied  woman disagreeably “i beg your pardon” offered edna  some embarrassment  she should have remembered  mademoiselle reisz’s avoidance   water had furnished  theme  much pleasantry some among them thought    account  her false hair or  dread  getting  violets wet while others attributed    natural aversion  water sometimes believed  accompany  artistic temperament mademoiselle offered edna some chocolates   paper bag which she took  her pocket  way  showing  she bore no ill feeling she habitually ate chocolates  their sustaining quality they contained much nutriment  small compass she said they saved her  starvation  madame lebrun’s table  utterly impossible  no one save so impertinent  woman  madame lebrun could think  offering such food  people  requiring them  pay  it “she must feel very lonely without her son” said edna desiring  change  subject “her favorite son too it must have been quite hard  let him go” mademoiselle laughed maliciously “her favorite son oh dear who could have been imposing such  tale upon you aline lebrun lives  victor   victor alone she  spoiled him into  worthless creature  is she worships him   ground  walks on robert  very well   way  give up all  money  can earn   family  keep  barest pittance  himself favorite son indeed i miss  poor fellow myself my dear i liked  see him   hear him about  place—the only lebrun who  worth  pinch  salt he comes  see me often   city i like  play  him that victor hanging would  too good  him it’s  wonder robert hasn’t beaten him  death long ago” “i thought  had great patience  his brother” offered edna glad   talking about robert no matter what  said “oh  thrashed him well enough  year or two ago” said mademoiselle “it  about  spanish girl whom victor considered   had some sort  claim

taking  thing so seriously  making such  fuss over it” “i’m not making any fuss over it but it’s just such seeming trifles  we’ve got  take seriously such things count” the fish  scorched mr pontellier would not touch it edna said she did not mind  little scorched taste the roast   some way not  his fancy   did not like  manner  which  vegetables  served “it seems  me”  said “we spend money enough  this house  procure  least one meal  day which  man could eat  retain his selfrespect” “you used  think  cook   treasure” returned edna indifferently “perhaps she  when she first came but cooks  only human they need looking after like any other class  persons  you employ suppose i didn’t look after  clerks  my office just let them run things their own way they’d soon make  nice mess  me  my business” “where  you going” asked edna seeing  her husband arose  table without having eaten  morsel except  taste   highlyseasoned soup “i’m going  get my dinner   club good night” he went into  hall took his hat  stick   stand  left  house she  somewhat familiar  such scenes they had often made her very unhappy on  few previous occasions she had been completely deprived  any desire  finish her dinner sometimes she had gone into  kitchen  administer  tardy rebuke   cook once she went  her room  studied  cookbook during  entire evening finally writing out  menu   week which left her harassed   feeling that after all she had accomplished no good   worth  name but  evening edna finished her dinner alone  forced deliberation her face  flushed  her eyes flamed  some inward fire  lighted them after finishing her dinner she went  her room having instructed  boy  tell any other callers  she  indisposed it   large beautiful room rich  picturesque   soft dim light which  maid had turned low she went  stood   open window  looked out upon  deep tangle   garden below all  mystery  witchery   night seemed  have gathered there amid  perfumes   dusky  tortuous outlines  flowers  foliage she  seeking herself  finding herself  just such sweet halfdarkness which met her moods but  voices  not soothing  came  her   darkness   sky above   stars they jeered  sounded mournful notes without promise devoid even  hope she turned back into  room  began  walk   fro down  whole length without stopping without resting she carried  her hands  thin handkerchief which she tore into ribbons rolled into  ball  flung  her once she stopped  taking off her wedding ring flung  upon  carpet when she saw  lying there she stamped her heel upon it striving  crush it but her small boot heel did not make  indenture not  mark upon  little glittering circlet in  sweeping passion she seized  glass vase   table  flung  upon  tiles   hearth she wanted  destroy something the crash  clatter  what she wanted  hear a maid alarmed   din  breaking glass entered  room  discover what   matter “a vase fell upon  hearth” said edna “never mind leave  till morning” “oh you might get some   glass  your feet ma’am” insisted  young woman picking up bits   broken vase   scattered upon  carpet “and here’s your ring ma’am under  chair” edna held out her hand  taking  ring slipped  upon her finger xviii the following morning mr pontellier upon leaving  his office asked edna if she would not meet him  town  order  look  some new fixtures   library “i hardly think we need new fixtures léonce don’t let us get anything new you  too extravagant i don’t believe you ever think  saving or putting by” “the way  become rich   make money my dear edna not  save it”  said he regretted  she did not feel inclined  go  him  select new fixtures he kissed her goodby  told her she  not looking well  must take care  herself she  unusually pale  very quiet she stood   front veranda   quitted  house  absently picked  few sprays  jessamine  grew upon  trellis near by she inhaled  odor   blossoms  thrust them into  bosom  her white morning gown the boys  dragging along  banquette  small

part  parcel   alien world which had suddenly become antagonistic she went back into  house she had thought  speaking   cook concerning her blunders   previous night but mr pontellier had saved her  disagreeable mission  which she  so poorly fitted mr pontellier’s arguments  usually convincing  those whom  employed he left home feeling quite sure    edna would sit down  evening  possibly  few subsequent evenings   dinner deserving   name edna spent  hour or two  looking over some  her old sketches she could see their shortcomings  defects which  glaring  her eyes she tried  work  little but found she  not   humor finally she gathered together  few   sketches—those which she considered  least discreditable  she carried them  her when  little later she dressed  left  house she looked handsome  distinguished  her street gown the tan   seashore had left her face  her forehead  smooth white  polished beneath her heavy yellowbrown hair there   few freckles  her face   small dark mole near  under lip  one   temple halfhidden  her hair as edna walked along  street she  thinking  robert she  still under  spell  her infatuation she had tried  forget him realizing  inutility  remembering but  thought  him  like  obsession ever pressing itself upon her it  not  she dwelt upon details  their acquaintance or recalled  any special or peculiar way his personality   his being his existence which dominated her thought fading sometimes  if  would melt into  mist   forgotten reviving again   intensity which filled her   incomprehensible longing edna   her way  madame ratignolle’s their intimacy begun  grand isle had not declined  they had seen each other  some frequency since their return   city the ratignolles lived  no great distance  edna’s home   corner   side street where monsieur ratignolle owned  conducted  drug store which enjoyed  steady  prosperous trade his father had been   business before him  monsieur ratignolle stood well   community  bore  enviable reputation  integrity  clearheadedness his family lived  commodious apartments over  store having  entrance   side within  porte cochère there  something which edna thought very french very foreign about their whole manner  living in  large  pleasant salon which extended across  width   house  ratignolles entertained their friends once  fortnight   soirée musicale sometimes diversified  cardplaying there   friend who played upon  cello one brought his flute  another his violin while there  some who sang   number who performed upon  piano  various degrees  taste  agility the ratignolles’ soirées musicales  widely known    considered  privilege   invited  them edna found her friend engaged  assorting  clothes which had returned  morning   laundry she  once abandoned her occupation upon seeing edna who had been ushered without ceremony into her presence “’cité can do   well  i   really her business” she explained  edna who apologized  interrupting her and she summoned  young black woman whom she instructed  french   very careful  checking off  list which she handed her she told her  notice particularly if  fine linen handkerchief  monsieur ratignolle’s which  missing last week had been returned    sure  set  one side such pieces  required mending  darning then placing  arm around edna’s waist she led her   front   house   salon where   cool  sweet   odor  great roses  stood upon  hearth  jars madame ratignolle looked more beautiful than ever there  home   negligé which left her arms almost wholly bare  exposed  rich melting curves  her white throat “perhaps i shall  able  paint your picture some day” said edna   smile when they  seated she produced  roll  sketches  started  unfold them “i believe i ought  work again i feel  if i wanted   doing something what do you think  them do you think  worth while  take  up again  study some more i might study   while  laidpore” she knew  madame ratignolle’s opinion  such  matter would  next  valueless  she herself had not alone decided but determined but she sought  words  praise  encouragement  would help her  put heart into her venture “your talent  immense dear” “nonsense” protested edna well pleased “immense i tell you” persisted madame ratignolle surveying  sketches one  one  close range then holding them  arm’s length narrowing her eyes  dropping her head  one side “surely this bavarian peasant  worthy  framing  this basket  apples never have i seen anything more lifelike one might almost  tempted  reach out  hand  take one” edna could not control  feeling which bordered upon complacency  her friend’s praise even realizing  she did  true worth she retained  few   sketches  gave all  rest  madame ratignolle who appreciated  gift far beyond  value  proudly exhibited  pictures  her husband when  came up   store  little later  his midday dinner mr ratignolle  one  those men who  called  salt   earth his cheerfulness  unbounded    matched  his goodness  heart his broad charity  common sense he  his wife spoke english   accent which  only discernible through  unenglish emphasis   certain carefulness  deliberation edna’s husband spoke english  no accent whatever the ratignolles understood each other perfectly if ever  fusion  two human beings into one  been accomplished  this sphere   surely  their union as edna seated herself  table  them she thought “better  dinner  herbs” though  did not take her long  discover    no dinner  herbs but  delicious repast simple choice   every way satisfying monsieur ratignolle  delighted  see her though  found her looking not so well   grand isle   advised  tonic he talked  good deal  various topics  little politics some city news  neighborhood gossip he spoke   animation  earnestness  gave  exaggerated importance  every syllable  uttered his wife  keenly interested  everything  said laying down her fork  better  listen chiming in taking  words out  his mouth edna felt depressed rather than soothed after leaving them the little glimpse  domestic harmony which had been offered her gave her no regret no longing it  not  condition  life which fitted her  she could see   but  appalling  hopeless ennui she  moved   kind  commiseration  madame ratignolle—a pity   colorless existence which never uplifted  possessor beyond  region  blind contentment  which no moment  anguish ever visited her soul  which she would never have  taste  life’s delirium edna vaguely wondered what she meant  “life’s delirium” it had crossed her thought like some unsought extraneous impression xix edna could not help but think    very foolish very childish  have stamped upon her wedding ring  smashed  crystal vase upon  tiles she  visited  no more outbursts moving her  such futile expedients she began  do  she liked   feel  she liked she completely abandoned her tuesdays  home  did not return  visits  those who had called upon her she made no ineffectual efforts  conduct her household en bonne ménagère going  coming   suited her fancy and so far  she  able lending herself  any passing caprice mr pontellier had been  rather courteous husband so long   met  certain tacit submissiveness  his wife but her new  unexpected line  conduct completely bewildered him it shocked him then her absolute disregard  her duties   wife angered him when mr pontellier became rude edna grew insolent she had resolved never  take another step backward “it seems  me  utmost folly   woman   head   household   mother  children  spend   atelier days which would  better employed contriving   comfort  her family” “i feel like painting” answered edna “perhaps i shan’t always feel like it” “then  god’s name paint but don’t let  family go   devil there’s madame ratignolle because she keeps up her music she doesn’t let everything else go  chaos and she’s more   musician than you   painter” “she isn’t  musician  i’m not  painter it isn’t  account  painting  i let things go” “on account  what then” “oh i don’t know let me alone you bother me” it sometimes entered mr pontellier’s mind  wonder if his wife  not growing  little unbalanced mentally he could see plainly  she  not herself that is  could not see  she  becoming herself  daily casting aside  fictitious self which we assume like  garment  which  appear before  world her husband let her alone  she requested  went away  his office edna went up  her atelier—a bright room   top   house she  working  great energy  interest without accomplishing anything however which satisfied her even   smallest degree for  time she had  whole household enrolled   service  art the boys posed  her they thought  amusing  first but  occupation soon lost  attractiveness when they discovered    not  game arranged especially  their entertainment the quadroon sat  hours before edna’s palette patient   savage while  housemaid took charge   children   drawingroom went undusted but  housemaid too served her term  model when edna perceived   young woman’s back  shoulders  molded  classic lines   her hair loosened   confining cap became  inspiration while edna worked she sometimes sang low  little air “ah si tu savais” it moved her  recollections she could hear again  ripple   water  flapping sail she could see  glint   moon upon  bay  could feel  soft gusty beating   hot south wind a subtle current  desire passed through her body weakening her hold upon  brushes  making her eyes burn there  days when she  very happy without knowing why she  happy   alive  breathing when her whole being seemed   one   sunlight  color  odors  luxuriant warmth  some perfect southern day she liked then  wander alone into strange  unfamiliar places she discovered many  sunny sleepy corner fashioned  dream in and she found  good  dream    alone  unmolested there  days when she  unhappy she did not know why—when  did not seem worth while   glad or sorry   alive or dead when life appeared  her like  grotesque pandemonium  humanity like worms struggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation she could not work  such  day nor weave fancies  stir her pulses  warm her blood xx it  during such  mood  edna hunted up mademoiselle reisz she had not forgotten  rather disagreeable impression left upon her  their last interview but she nevertheless felt  desire  see her—above all  listen while she played upon  piano quite early   afternoon she started upon her quest   pianist unfortunately she had mislaid or lost mademoiselle reisz’s card  looking up her address   city directory she found   woman lived  bienville street some distance away the directory which fell into her

mademoiselle happened  have received  letter  robert during  interval  edna’s visits she would give her  letter unsolicited and she would seat herself   piano  play  her humor prompted her while  young woman read  letter the little stove  roaring   redhot   chocolate   tin sizzled  sputtered edna went forward  opened  stove door  mademoiselle rising took  letter  under  bust  beethoven  handed   edna “another so soon” she exclaimed her eyes filled  delight “tell me mademoiselle does  know  i see his letters” “never   world he would  angry  would never write  me again if  thought so does  write  you never  line does  send you  message never  word it  because  loves you poor fool   trying  forget you since you  not free  listen  him or  belong  him” “why do you show me his letters then” “haven’t you begged  them can i refuse you anything oh you cannot deceive me”  mademoiselle approached her beloved instrument  began  play edna did not  once read  letter she sat holding   her hand while  music penetrated her whole being like  effulgence warming  brightening  dark places  her soul it prepared her  joy  exultation “oh” she exclaimed letting  letter fall   floor “why did you not tell me” she went  grasped mademoiselle’s hands up   keys “oh unkind malicious why did you not tell me” “that   coming back no great news ma foi i wonder  did not come long ago” “but when when” cried edna impatiently “he does not say when” “he says ‘very soon’ you know  much about   i do   all   letter” “but why why   coming oh if i thought—”  she snatched  letter   floor  turned  pages this way   way looking   reason which  left untold “if i  young   love   man” said mademoiselle turning   stool  pressing her wiry hands between her knees  she looked down  edna who sat   floor holding  letter “it seems  me  would have   some grand esprit  man  lofty aims  ability  reach them one who stood high enough  attract  notice  his fellowmen it seems  me if i  young   love i should never deem  man  ordinary caliber worthy  my devotion” “now   you who  telling lies  seeking  deceive me mademoiselle or else you have never been  love  know nothing about it why” went  edna clasping her knees  looking up into mademoiselle’s twisted face “do you suppose  woman knows why she loves does she select does she say  herself ‘go to here   distinguished statesman  presidential possibilities i shall proceed  fall  love  him’ or ‘i shall set my heart upon this musician whose fame   every tongue’ or ‘this financier who controls  world’s money markets’ “you  purposely misunderstanding me ma reine are you  love  robert” “yes” said edna it   first time she had admitted it   glow overspread her face blotching   red spots “why” asked her companion “why do you love him when you ought not to” edna   motion or two dragged herself  her knees before mademoiselle reisz who took  glowing face between her two hands “why because his hair  brown  grows away  his temples because  opens  shuts his eyes  his nose   little out  drawing because   two lips   square chin   little finger which  can’t straighten  having played baseball too energetically  his youth because—” “because you do  short” laughed mademoiselle “what  you do when  comes back” she asked “do nothing except feel glad  happy   alive” she  already glad  happy   alive   mere thought  his return the murky lowering sky which had depressed her  few hours before seemed bracing  invigorating  she splashed through  streets  her way home she stopped   confectioner’s  ordered  huge box  bonbons   children  iberville she slipped  card   box  which she scribbled  tender message  sent  abundance  kisses before dinner   evening edna wrote  charming letter  her husband telling him  her intention  move   while into  little house around  block   give  farewell dinner before leaving regretting    not there  share it  help out   menu  assist her  entertaining  guests her letter  brilliant  brimming  cheerfulness xxvii “what   matter  you” asked arobin  evening “i never found you  such  happy mood” edna  tired   time   reclining   lounge before  fire “don’t you know  weather prophet  told us we shall see  sun pretty soon” “well  ought   reason enough”  acquiesced “you wouldn’t give me another if i sat here all night imploring you” he sat close  her   low tabouret    spoke his fingers lightly touched  hair  fell  little over her forehead she liked  touch  his fingers through her hair  closed her eyes sensitively “one  these days” she said “i’m going  pull myself together   while  think—try  determine what character   woman i am for candidly i don’t know by all  codes which i am acquainted with i am  devilishly wicked specimen   sex but some way i can’t convince myself  i am i must think about it” “don’t what’s  use why should you bother thinking about  when i can tell you what manner  woman you are” his fingers strayed occasionally down  her warm smooth cheeks  firm chin which  growing  little full  double “oh yes you  tell me  i am adorable everything   captivating spare yourself  effort” “no i shan’t tell you anything   sort though i shouldn’t  lying if i did” “do you know mademoiselle reisz” she asked irrelevantly “the pianist i know her  sight i’ve heard her play” “she says queer things sometimes   bantering way  you don’t notice   time  you find yourself thinking about afterward” “for instance” “well  instance when i left her today she put her arms around me  felt my shoulder blades  see if my wings  strong she said ‘the bird  would soar above  level plain  tradition  prejudice must have strong wings it   sad spectacle  see  weaklings bruised exhausted fluttering back  earth’” “whither would you soar” “i’m not thinking  any extraordinary flights i only half comprehend her” “i’ve heard she’s partially demented” said arobin “she seems  me wonderfully sane” edna replied “i’m told she’s extremely disagreeable  unpleasant why have you introduced her   moment when i desired  talk  you” “oh talk  me if you like” cried edna clasping her hands beneath her head “but let me think  something else while you do” “i’m jealous  your thoughts tonight they’re making you  little kinder than usual but some way i feel  if they  wandering  if they  not here  me” she only looked  him  smiled his eyes  very near he leaned upon  lounge   arm extended across her while  other hand still rested upon her hair they continued silently  look into each other’s eyes when  leaned forward  kissed her she clasped his head holding his lips  hers it   first kiss  her life  which her nature had really responded it   flaming torch  kindled desire xxviii edna cried  little  night after arobin left her it  only one phase   multitudinous emotions which had assailed her there   her  overwhelming feeling  irresponsibility there   shock   unexpected   unaccustomed there  her husband’s reproach looking  her   external things around her which  had provided  her external existence there  robert’s reproach making itself felt   quicker fiercer more overpowering love which had awakened within her toward him above all there  understanding she felt  if  mist had been lifted  her eyes enabling her  look upon  comprehend  significance  life  monster made up  beauty  brutality but among  conflicting sensations which assailed her there  neither shame nor remorse there   dull pang  regret because   not  kiss  love which had inflamed her because   not love which had held this cup  life  her lips xxix without even waiting   answer  her husband regarding his opinion or wishes   matter edna hastened her preparations  quitting her home  esplanade street  moving into  little house around  block a feverish anxiety attended her every action   direction there  no moment  deliberation no interval  repose between  thought   fulfillment early upon  morning following those hours passed  arobin’s society edna set about securing her new abode  hurrying her arrangements  occupying it within  precincts  her home she felt like one who  entered  lingered within  portals  some forbidden temple  which  thousand muffled voices bade her begone whatever  her own   house everything which she had acquired aside  her husband’s bounty she caused   transported   other house supplying simple  meager deficiencies  her own resources arobin found her  rolled sleeves working

he  no doubt prepared  any emergency ready  any one   foregoing attitudes just   bent himself easily  naturally   situation which confronted him “please come down”  insisted holding  ladder  looking up  her “no” she answered “ellen  afraid  mount  ladder joe  working over   ‘pigeon house’—that’s  name ellen gives it because it’s so small  looks like  pigeon house—and some one   do this” arobin pulled off his coat  expressed himself ready  willing  tempt fate  her place ellen brought him one  her dustcaps  went into contortions  mirth which she found  impossible  control when she saw him put

directed when  had finished  took off his dustcap  went out  wash his hands edna  sitting   tabouret idly brushing  tips   feather duster along  carpet when  came  again “is there anything more you  let me do”  asked “that  all” she answered “ellen can manage  rest” she kept  young woman occupied   drawingroom unwilling   left alone  arobin “what about  dinner”  asked “the grand event  coup

wonder what he’ll say when  sees  bills” “and you ask me why i call   coup d’état” arobin had put  his coat   stood before her  asked if his cravat  plumb she told him  was looking no higher than  tip  his collar “when do you go   ‘pigeon house’—with all due acknowledgment  ellen” “day after tomorrow after  dinner i shall sleep there” “ellen  you very kindly get me  glass  water” asked arobin “the dust   curtains if you  pardon me  hinting such  thing  parched my throat   crisp” “while ellen gets  water” said edna rising “i  say goodby  let you go i must get rid  this grime  i have  million things  do  think of” “when shall i see you” asked arobin seeking  detain her  maid having left  room “at  dinner  course you  invited” “not before—not tonight or tomorrow morning or tomorrow noon or night or  day after morning or noon can’t you see yourself without my telling you what  eternity  is” he had followed her into  hall    foot   stairway looking up  her  she mounted  her face half turned  him “not  instant sooner” she said but she laughed  looked  him  eyes   once gave him courage  wait  made  torture  wait xxx though edna had spoken   dinner   very grand affair    truth  very

discover  vibrant flesh there  something  her attitude  her whole appearance when she leaned her head against  highbacked chair  spread her arms which suggested  regal woman  one who rules who looks on who stands alone but  she sat there amid her guests she felt  old ennui overtaking her  hopelessness which so often assailed her which came upon her like  obsession like something extraneous independent  volition it  something which announced itself  chill breath  seemed  issue  some vast cavern wherein discords waited there came over her  acute longing which always summoned into her

turned her head  she bowed pleasantly  all  she withdrew  table she kissed edna upon  shoulder  whispered “bonne nuit ma reine soyez sage” she had been  little bewildered upon rising or rather descending  her cushions  monsieur ratignolle gallantly took her arm  led her away mrs highcamp  weaving  garland  roses yellow  red when she had finished  garland she laid  lightly upon victor’s black curls he  reclining far back   luxurious chair holding  glass  champagne   light as if  magician’s wand had touched him  garland  roses transformed him into  vision  oriental beauty his cheeks   color  crushed grapes  his dusky eyes glowed   languishing fire “sapristi” exclaimed arobin but mrs highcamp had one more touch  add   picture she took   back  her chair  white silken scarf  which she had covered her shoulders   early part   evening she draped  across  boy  graceful folds    way  conceal his black conventional evening dress he did not seem  mind what she did  him only smiled showing  faint gleam  white teeth while  continued  gaze  narrowing eyes   light through his glass  champagne “oh   able  paint  color rather than  words” exclaimed miss mayblunt losing herself   rhapsodic dream  she looked  him “‘there   graven image  desire painted  red blood   ground  gold’” murmured gouvernail under his breath the effect   wine upon victor   change his accustomed volubility into silence he seemed  have abandoned himself   reverie    seeing pleasing visions   amber bead “sing” entreated mrs highcamp “won’t you sing  us” “let him alone” said arobin “he’s posing” offered mr merriman “let him have  out” “i believe he’s paralyzed” laughed mrs merriman and leaning over  youth’s chair she took  glass  his hand  held   his lips he sipped  wine slowly  when  had drained  glass she laid  upon  table  wiped his lips  her little filmy handkerchief “yes i’ll sing  you”  said turning  his chair toward mrs highcamp he clasped his hands behind his head  looking up   ceiling began  hum  little trying his voice like  musician tuning  instrument then looking  edna  began  sing “ah si tu savais” “stop” she cried “don’t sing that i don’t want you  sing it”  she laid her glass so impetuously  blindly upon  table   shatter  against  carafe the wine spilled over arobin’s legs  some   trickled down upon mrs highcamp’s black gauze gown victor had lost all idea  courtesy or else  thought his hostess  not  earnest   laughed  went on “ah si tu savais ce que tes yeux me disent”— “oh you mustn’t you mustn’t” exclaimed edna  pushing back her chair she got up  going behind him placed her hand over his mouth he kissed  soft palm  pressed upon his lips “no no i won’t mrs pontellier i didn’t know you meant it” looking up  her  caressing eyes the touch  his lips  like  pleasing sting  her hand she lifted  garland  roses  his head  flung  across  room “come victor you’ve posed long enough give mrs highcamp her scarf” mrs highcamp undraped  scarf  about him  her own hands miss mayblunt  mr gouvernail suddenly conceived  notion    time  say good night and mr  mrs merriman wondered how  could  so late before parting  victor mrs highcamp invited him  call upon her daughter who she knew would  charmed  meet him  talk french  sing french songs  him victor expressed his desire  intention  call upon miss highcamp   first opportunity which presented itself he asked if arobin  going his way arobin  not the mandolin players had long since stolen away a profound stillness had fallen upon  broad beautiful street the voices  edna’s disbanding guests jarred like  discordant note upon  quiet harmony   night xxxi “well” questioned arobin who had remained  edna after  others had departed “well” she reiterated  stood up stretching her arms  feeling  need  relax her muscles after having been so long seated “what next”  asked “the servants  all gone they left when  musicians did i have dismissed them the house    closed  locked  i shall trot around   pigeon house  shall send celestine over   morning  straighten things up” he looked around  began  turn out some   lights “what about upstairs”  inquired “i think   all right but there may   window

sometimes felt very tired  mrs highcamp  mrs merriman late   afternoon she sought refuge  mademoiselle reisz  stayed there alone waiting  her feeling  kind  repose invade her   very atmosphere   shabby unpretentious little room edna sat   window which looked out over  housetops  across  river the window frame  filled  pots  flowers  she sat  picked  dry leaves   rose geranium the day  warm   breeze which blew   river  very pleasant she removed her hat  laid    piano she went  picking  leaves  digging around  plants  her hat pin once she thought she heard mademoiselle reisz approaching but    young black girl who came in bringing  small bundle  laundry which she deposited   adjoining room  went away edna seated herself   piano  softly picked out  one hand  bars   piece  music which lay open before her a halfhour went by there   occasional sound  people going  coming   lower hall she  growing interested  her occupation  picking out  aria when there   second rap   door she vaguely wondered what these people did when they found mademoiselle’s door locked “come in” she called turning her face toward  door and this time   robert lebrun who presented himself she attempted  rise she could not have done so without betraying  agitation which mastered her  sight  him so she fell back upon  stool only exclaiming “why robert” he came  clasped her hand seemingly without knowing what   saying or doing “mrs pontellier how do you happen—oh how well you look is mademoiselle reisz not here i never expected  see you” “when did you come back” asked edna   unsteady voice wiping her face  her handkerchief she seemed ill  ease   piano stool   begged her  take  chair   window she did so mechanically while  seated himself   stool “i returned day before yesterday”  answered while  leaned his arm   keys bringing forth  crash  discordant sound “day before yesterday” she repeated aloud  went  thinking  herself “day before yesterday”   sort   uncomprehending way she had pictured him seeking her   very first hour   had lived under  same sky since day before yesterday while only  accident had  stumbled upon her mademoiselle must have lied when she said “poor fool  loves you” “day before yesterday” she repeated breaking off  spray  mademoiselle’s geranium “then if you had not met me here today you wouldn’t—when—that is didn’t you mean  come  see me” “of course i should have gone  see you there have been so many things—”  turned  leaves  mademoiselle’s music nervously “i started   once yesterday   old firm after all there   much chance  me here  there  there—that is i might find  profitable some day the mexicans  not very congenial” so  had come back because  mexicans  not congenial because business   profitable here  there because  any reason  not because  cared   near her she remembered  day she sat   floor turning  pages  his letter seeking  reason which  left untold she had not noticed how  looked—only feeling his presence but she turned deliberately  observed him after all  had been absent but  few months   not changed his hair—the color  hers—waved back  his temples   same way  before his skin  not more burned than  had been  grand isle she found  his eyes when  looked  her  one silent moment  same tender caress   added warmth  entreaty which had not been there before—the same glance which had penetrated   sleeping places  her soul  awakened them a hundred times edna had pictured robert’s return  imagined their first meeting it  usually  her home whither  had sought her out  once she always fancied him expressing or betraying  some way his love  her and here  reality   they sat ten feet apart she   window crushing geranium leaves  her hand  smelling them  twirling around   piano stool saying “i  very much surprised  hear  mr pontellier’s absence it’s  wonder mademoiselle reisz did not tell me  your moving—mother told me yesterday i should think you would have gone  new york  him or  iberville   children rather than  bothered here  housekeeping and you  going abroad too i hear we shan’t have you  grand isle next summer  won’t seem—do you see much  mademoiselle reisz she often spoke  you   few letters she wrote” “do you remember  you promised  write  me when you went away” a flush overspread his whole face “i couldn’t believe  my letters would   any interest  you” “that   excuse  isn’t  truth” edna reached  her hat   piano she adjusted it sticking  hat pin through  heavy coil  hair  some deliberation “are you not going  wait  mademoiselle reisz” asked robert “no i have found when she  absent this long she  liable not  come back till late” she drew  her gloves  robert picked up his hat “won’t you wait  her” asked edna “not if you think she  not  back till late” adding  if suddenly aware  some discourtesy  his speech “and i should miss  pleasure  walking home  you” edna locked  door  put  key back   hidingplace they went together picking their way across muddy streets  sidewalks encumbered   cheap display  small tradesmen part   distance they rode   car  after disembarking passed  pontellier mansion which looked broken  half torn asunder robert had never known  house  looked    interest “i never knew you  your home”  remarked “i am glad you did not” “why” she did not answer they went  around  corner   seemed  if her dreams  coming true after all when  followed her into  little house “you must stay  dine  me robert you see i am all alone    so long since i have seen you there  so much i want  ask you” she took off her hat  gloves he stood irresolute making some excuse about his mother who expected him  even muttered something about  engagement she struck  match  lit  lamp   table   growing dusk when  saw her face   lamplight looking pained  all  soft lines gone out  it  threw his hat aside  seated himself “oh you know i want  stay if you  let me”  exclaimed all  softness came back she laughed  went  put her hand  his shoulder “this   first moment you have seemed like  old robert i’ll go tell celestine” she hurried away  tell celestine  set  extra place she even sent her off  search  some added delicacy which she had not thought   herself and she recommended great care  dripping  coffee  having  omelet done   proper turn when she reentered robert  turning over magazines sketches  things  lay upon  table  great disorder he picked up  photograph  exclaimed “alcée arobin what  earth  his picture doing here” “i tried  make  sketch  his head one day” answered edna “and  thought  photograph might help me it    other house i thought  had been left there i must have packed  up  my drawing materials” “i should think you would give  back  him if you have finished  it” “oh i have  great many such photographs i never think  returning them they don’t amount  anything” robert kept  looking   picture “it seems  me—do you think his head worth drawing is   friend  mr pontellier’s you never said you knew him” “he isn’t  friend  mr pontellier’s he’s  friend  mine i always knew him—that is   only  late  i know him pretty well but i’d rather talk about you  know what you have been seeing  doing  feeling out there  mexico” robert threw aside  picture “i’ve been seeing  waves   white beach  grand isle  quiet grassy street   chênière  old fort  grande terre i’ve been working like  machine  feeling like  lost soul there  nothing interesting” she leaned her head upon her hand  shade her eyes   light “and what have you been seeing  doing  feeling all these days”  asked “i’ve been seeing  waves   white beach  grand isle  quiet grassy street   chênière caminada  old sunny fort  grande terre i’ve been working   little more comprehension than  machine  still feeling like  lost soul there  nothing interesting” “mrs pontellier you  cruel”  said  feeling closing his eyes  resting his head back  his chair they remained  silence till old celestine announced dinner xxxiv the diningroom  very small edna’s round mahogany would have almost filled it as   there  but

looking  her but rolling  cigarette his tobacco pouch which  laid upon  table   fantastic embroidered silk affair evidently  handiwork   woman “you used  carry your tobacco   rubber pouch” said edna picking up  pouch  examining  needlework “yes   lost” “where did you buy this one in mexico” “it  given  me   vera cruz girl they  very generous”  replied striking  match  lighting his cigarette “they  very handsome i suppose those mexican women very picturesque  their black eyes  their lace scarfs” “some are others  hideous just  you find women everywhere” “what  she like—the one who gave you  pouch you must have known her very well” “she  very ordinary she wasn’t   slightest importance i knew her well enough” “did you visit  her house was  interesting i should like  know  hear about  people you met   impressions they made  you” “there  some people who leave impressions not so lasting   imprint   oar upon  water” “was she such  one” “it would  ungenerous  me  admit  she    order

confidences” “i’ve been imposing myself long enough” said robert rising  shaking hands  edna “please convey my regards  mr pontellier when you write” he shook hands  arobin  went away “fine fellow  lebrun” said arobin when robert had gone “i never heard you speak  him” “i knew him last summer  grand isle” she replied “here   photograph  yours don’t you want it” “what do i want  it throw  away” she threw  back   table “i’m not going  mrs merriman’s” she said “if you see her tell her so but perhaps i had better write i think i shall write now  say  i am sorry her child  sick  tell her not

they had been  her hungry heart a vision—a transcendently seductive vision   mexican girl arose before her she writhed   jealous pang she wondered when  would come back he had not said  would come back she had been  him had heard his voice  touched his hand but some way  had seemed nearer  her off there  mexico xxxv the morning  full  sunlight  hope edna could see before her no denial—only  promise  excessive joy she lay  bed awake  bright eyes full  speculation “he loves you poor fool” if she could but get  conviction firmly fixed  her mind what mattered about  rest she felt she had been childish  unwise  night before  giving herself over  despondency she recapitulated  motives which no doubt explained robert’s reserve they  not insurmountable they would not hold if  really loved her they could not hold against her own passion which  must come  realize  time she pictured him going  his business  morning she even saw how   dressed how  walked down one street  turned  corner  another saw him bending over his desk talking  people who entered  office going  his lunch  perhaps watching  her   street he would come  her   afternoon or evening sit  roll his cigarette talk  little  go away   had done  night before but how delicious  would   have him there  her she would have no regrets nor seek  penetrate his reserve if  still chose  wear it edna ate her breakfast only half dressed the maid brought her  delicious printed scrawl  raoul expressing his love asking her  send him some bonbons  telling her they had found  morning ten tiny white pigs all lying   row beside lidie’s big white pig a letter also came  her husband saying  hoped   back early  march  then they would get ready   journey abroad which  had promised her so long which  felt now fully able  afford

promising them bonbons  congratulating them upon their happy find   little pigs she answered her husband  friendly evasiveness—not  any fixed design  mislead him only because all sense  reality had gone out  her life she had abandoned herself  fate  awaited  consequences  indifference to arobin’s note she made no reply she put  under celestine’s stovelid edna worked several hours  much spirit she saw no one but  picture dealer who asked her if   true  she  going abroad  study  paris she said possibly she might   negotiated  her  some parisian studies  reach him  time   holiday trade  december robert did not come  day she  keenly disappointed he did not come  following day nor  next each morning she awoke  hope  each night she   prey  despondency she  tempted  seek him out but far  yielding   impulse she avoided any occasion which might throw her  his way she did not go  mademoiselle reisz’s nor pass  madame lebrun’s  she might have done if  had still been  mexico when arobin one night urged her  drive  him she went—out   lake   shell road his horses  full  mettle  even  little unmanageable she liked  rapid gait  which they spun along   quick sharp sound   horses’ hoofs   hard road they did not stop anywhere  eat or  drink arobin  not needlessly imprudent but they ate  they drank when they regained edna’s little diningroom—which  comparatively early   evening it  late when  left her it  getting   more than  passing whim  arobin  see her    her he had detected  latent sensuality which unfolded under his delicate sense  her nature’s requirements like  torpid torrid sensitive blossom there  no despondency when she fell asleep  night nor  there hope when she awoke   morning xxxvi there   garden out   suburbs  small leafy corner   few green tables under  orange

handkerchief tight  her hand   nervous clutch her face  drawn  pinched her sweet blue eyes haggard  unnatural all her beautiful hair had been drawn back  plaited it lay   long braid   sofa pillow coiled like  golden serpent the nurse  comfortable looking griffe woman  white apron  cap  urging her  return  her bedroom “there  no use there  no use” she said  once  edna “we must get rid  mandelet   getting too old  careless he said  would  here  halfpast seven now  must  eight see what time  is joséphine” the woman  possessed   cheerful nature  refused  take any situation too seriously especially  situation  which she  so familiar she urged madame  have courage  patience but madame only set her teeth hard into her under lip  edna saw  sweat gather  beads  her white forehead after  moment or two she uttered  profound sigh  wiped her face   handkerchief rolled   ball she appeared exhausted the nurse gave her  fresh handkerchief sprinkled  cologne water “this  too much” she cried “mandelet ought   killed where  alphonse is  possible i am   abandoned like this—neglected  every one” “neglected indeed” exclaimed  nurse wasn’t she there and here  mrs pontellier leaving no doubt  pleasant evening  home  devote  her and wasn’t monsieur ratignolle coming  very instant through  hall and joséphine  quite sure she had heard doctor mandelet’s coupé yes there  was down   door adèle consented  go back  her room she sat   edge   little low couch next  her bed doctor mandelet paid no attention  madame ratignolle’s upbraidings he  accustomed  them  such times   too well convinced  her loyalty  doubt it he  glad  see edna  wanted her  go  him into  salon  entertain him but madame ratignolle would not consent  edna should leave her   instant between agonizing moments she chatted  little  said  took her mind off her sufferings edna began  feel uneasy she  seized   vague dread her own like experiences seemed far away unreal  only half remembered she recalled faintly  ecstasy  pain  heavy odor  chloroform  stupor which had deadened sensation   awakening  find  little new life  which she had given being added   great unnumbered multitude  souls  come  go she began  wish she had not come her presence  not necessary she might have invented  pretext  staying away she might even invent  pretext now  going but edna did not go with  inward agony   flaming outspoken revolt against  ways  nature she witnessed  scene  torture she  still stunned  speechless  emotion when later she leaned over her friend  kiss her  softly say goodby adèle pressing her cheek whispered   exhausted voice “think   children edna oh think   children remember them” xxxviii edna still felt dazed when she got outside   open air the doctor’s coupé had returned  him  stood before  porte cochère she did not wish  enter  coupé  told doctor mandelet she would walk she  not afraid  would go alone he directed his carriage  meet him  mrs pontellier’s   started  walk home  her up—away up over  narrow street between  tall houses  stars  blazing the air  mild  caressing but cool   breath  spring   night they walked slowly  doctor   heavy measured tread  his hands behind him edna   absentminded way  she had walked one night  grand isle  if her thoughts had gone ahead  her  she  striving  overtake them “you shouldn’t have been there mrs pontellier”  said “that  no place  you adèle  full  whims  such times there   dozen women she might have had  her unimpressionable women i felt    cruel cruel you shouldn’t have gone” “oh well” she answered indifferently “i don’t know   matters after all one   think   children some time or other  sooner  better” “when  léonce coming back” “quite soon some time  march” “and you  going abroad” “perhaps—no i am not going i’m not going   forced into doing things i don’t want  go abroad i want   let alone nobody  any right—except children perhaps—and even then  seems  me—or  did seem—” she felt  her speech  voicing  incoherency  her thoughts  stopped abruptly “the trouble is” sighed  doctor grasping her meaning intuitively “that youth  given up  illusions it seems    provision  nature  decoy  secure mothers   race and nature takes no account  moral consequences  arbitrary conditions which we create  which we feel obliged  maintain  any cost” “yes” she said “the years   gone seem like dreams—if one might go  sleeping  dreaming—but  wake up  find—oh well perhaps   better  wake up after all even  suffer rather than  remain  dupe  illusions all one’s life” “it seems  me my dear child” said  doctor  parting holding her hand “you seem  me    trouble i am not going  ask  your confidence i  only say  if ever you feel moved  give   me perhaps i might help you i know i would understand and i tell you there  not many who would—not many my dear” “some way i don’t feel moved  speak  things  trouble me don’t think i am ungrateful or  i don’t appreciate your sympathy there  periods  despondency  suffering which take possession  me but i don’t want anything but my own way that  wanting  good deal  course when you have  trample upon  lives  hearts  prejudices  others—but no matter—still i shouldn’t want  trample upon  little lives oh i don’t know what i’m saying doctor good night don’t blame me  anything” “yes i  blame you if you don’t come  see me soon we  talk  things you never have dreamt  talking about before it  do us both good i don’t want you  blame yourself whatever comes good night my child” she let herself    gate but instead  entering she sat upon  step   porch the night  quiet  soothing all  tearing emotion   last few hours seemed  fall away  her like  somber uncomfortable garment which she had but  loosen   rid of she went back   hour before adèle had sent  her  her senses kindled afresh

dinner   allurements  city life when mrs pontellier herself slipped around  corner   house the two youngsters stayed dumb  amazement before what they considered    apparition but   really she  flesh  blood looking tired   little travelstained “i walked up   wharf” she said “and heard  hammering i supposed   you mending  porch it’s  good thing i  always tripping over those loose planks last summer how dreary  deserted everything looks” it took victor some little time  comprehend  she had come  beaudelet’s lugger  she had come alone   no purpose but  rest “there’s nothing fixed up yet you see

but victor’s astonishment  so genuine  mrs pontellier’s indifference so apparent   disturbing notion did not lodge long  her brain she contemplated   greatest interest this woman who gave  most sumptuous dinners  america  who had all  men  new orleans  her feet “what time  you have dinner” asked edna “i’m very hungry but don’t get anything extra” “i’ll have  ready  little or no time”  said

what i can do by gimminy women have no consideration she might have sent me word” edna walked  down   beach rather mechanically not noticing anything special except   sun  hot she  not dwelling upon any particular train  thought she had done all  thinking which  necessary after robert went away when she lay awake upon  sofa till morning she had said over  over  herself “today   arobin tomorrow    some one else it makes no difference  me  doesn’t matter about léonce pontellier—but raoul  etienne” she understood now clearly what she had meant long ago when she said  adèle ratignolle  she would give up  unessential but she would never sacrifice herself  her children despondency had come upon her there   wakeful night  had never lifted there  no one thing   world  she desired there  no human being whom she wanted near her except robert  she even realized   day would come when he too   thought  him would melt out  her existence leaving her alone the children appeared before her like antagonists who had overcome her who had overpowered  sought  drag her into  soul’s slavery   rest  her days but she knew  way  elude them she  not thinking  these things when she walked down   beach the water   gulf stretched out before her gleaming   million lights   sun the voice   sea  seductive never ceasing whispering clamoring murmuring inviting  soul  wander  abysses  solitude all along  white beach up  down there  no living thing  sight a bird   broken wing  beating  air above reeling fluttering circling disabled down down   water edna had found her old bathing suit still hanging faded upon  accustomed peg she put  on leaving her clothing   bathhouse but when she  there beside  sea absolutely alone she cast  unpleasant pricking garments  her    first time  her life she stood naked   open air   mercy   sun  breeze  beat upon her   waves  invited her how strange  awful  seemed  stand naked under  sky how delicious she felt like some newborn creature opening  eyes   familiar world   had never known the foamy wavelets curled up  her white feet  coiled like serpents about her ankles she walked out the water  chill but she walked on the water  deep but she lifted her white body  reached out   long sweeping stroke the touch   sea  sensuous enfolding  body   soft close embrace she went   on she remembered  night she swam far out  recalled  terror  seized her   fear  being unable  regain  shore she did not look back now but went   on thinking   bluegrass meadow  she had traversed when  little child believing   had no beginning  no end her arms  legs  growing tired she thought  léonce   children they   part  her life but they need not have thought  they could possess her body  soul how mademoiselle reisz would have laughed perhaps sneered if she knew “and you call yourself  artist what pretensions madame the artist must possess  courageous soul  dares  defies” exhaustion  pressing upon  overpowering her “goodby—because i love you” he did not know  did not understand he would never understand perhaps doctor mandelet would have understood if she had seen him—but   too late  shore  far behind her  her strength  gone she looked into  distance   old terror flamed up   instant then sank again edna heard her father’s voice  her sister margaret’s she heard  barking   old dog   chained   sycamore tree the spurs   cavalry officer clanged   walked across  porch there   hum  bees   musky odor  pinks filled  air beyond the bayou the bayou curved like  crescent around  point  land  which la folle’s cabin stood between  stream   hut lay  big abandoned field where cattle  pastured when  bayou supplied them  water enough through  woods  spread back into unknown regions  woman had drawn  imaginary line  past this circle she never stepped this   form  her only mania she  now  large gaunt black woman past thirtyfive her real name  jacqueline but every one   plantation called her la folle because  childhood she had been frightened literally “out  her senses”  had never wholly regained them it  when there had been skirmishing  sharpshooting all day   woods evening  near when p’tit maître black  powder  crimson  blood had staggered into  cabin  jacqueline’s mother his pursuers close  his heels the sight had stunned her childish reason she dwelt alone  her solitary cabin   rest   quarters had long since been removed beyond her sight  knowledge she had more physical strength than most men  made her patch  cotton  corn  tobacco like  best  them but   world beyond  bayou she had long known nothing save what her morbid fancy conceived people  bellissime had grown used  her  her way  they thought nothing  it even when “old mis’” died they did not wonder  la folle had not crossed  bayou but had stood upon her side  it wailing  lamenting p’tit maître  now  owner  bellissime he   middleaged man   family  beautiful daughters about him   little son whom la folle loved  if  had been her own she called him chéri  so did every one else because she did none   girls had ever been  her what chéri was they had each  all loved    her   listen  her wondrous stories  things  always happened “yonda beyon’ de bayou” but none  them had stroked her black hand quite  chéri did nor rested their heads against her knee so confidingly nor fallen asleep  her arms   used  do for chéri hardly did such things now since  had become  proud possessor   gun  had had his black curls cut off that summer—the summer chéri gave la folle two black curls tied   knot  red ribbon—the water ran so low   bayou  even  little children  bellissime  able  cross   foot   cattle  sent  pasture down   river la folle  sorry when they  gone  she loved these dumb companions well  liked  feel  they  there   hear them browsing  night up  her own enclosure it  saturday afternoon when  fields  deserted the men had flocked   neighboring village  do their week’s trading   women  occupied  household affairs—la folle  well   others it  then she mended  washed her handful  clothes scoured her house  did her baking in this last employment she never forgot chéri today she had fashioned croquignoles   most fantastic  alluring shapes  him so when she saw  boy come trudging across  old field  his gleaming little new rifle  his shoulder she called out gayly  him “chéri chéri” but chéri did not need  summons    coming straight  her his pockets all bulged out  almonds  raisins   orange   had secured  her   very fine dinner which had been given  day up  his father’s house he   sunnyfaced youngster  ten when  had emptied his pockets la folle patted his round red cheek wiped his soiled hands  her apron  smoothed his hair then she watched him as  his cakes  his hand  crossed her strip  cotton back   cabin  disappeared into  wood he had boasted   things   going  do  his gun out there “you think they got plenty deer   wood la folle”  had inquired   calculating air   experienced hunter “non non”  woman laughed “don’t you look fo’ no deer chéri dat’s too big but you bring la folle one good fat squirrel fo’ her dinner tomorrow an’ she goin’  satisfi’” “one squirrel ain’t  bite i’ll bring you mo’ ’an one la folle”  had boasted pompously   went away when  woman  hour later heard  report   boy’s rifle close   wood’s edge she would have thought nothing   if  sharp cry  distress had not followed  sound she withdrew her arms   tub  suds  which they had been plunged dried them upon her apron   quickly  her trembling limbs would bear her hurried   spot whence  ominous report had come it   she feared there she found chéri stretched upon  ground  his rifle beside him he moaned piteously— “i’m dead la folle i’m dead i’m gone” “non non” she exclaimed resolutely  she knelt beside him “put you’ arm ’roun’ la folle’s nake chéri dat’s nuttin’ dat goin’  nuttin’” she lifted him  her powerful arms chéri had carried his gun muzzledownward he had stumbled—he did not know how he only knew   had  ball lodged somewhere  his leg   thought  his end   hand now  his head upon  woman’s shoulder  moaned  wept  pain  fright “oh la folle la folle  hurt so bad i can’ stan’ it la folle” “don’t cry mon bébé mon bébé mon chéri”  woman spoke soothingly  she covered  ground  long strides “la folle goin’ mine you doctor bonfils goin’ come make mon chéri well agin” she had reached  abandoned field as she crossed   her precious burden she looked constantly  restlessly  side  side a terrible fear  upon her—the fear   world beyond  bayou  morbid  insane dread she had been under since childhood when she    bayou’s edge she stood there  shouted  help  if  life depended upon it— “oh p’tit maître p’tit maître venez donc au secours au secours” no voice responded chéri’s hot tears  scalding her neck she called  each  every one upon  place  still no answer came she shouted she wailed but whether her voice remained unheard or unheeded no reply came  her frenzied cries and all  while chéri moaned  wept  entreated   taken home  his mother la folle gave  last despairing look around her extreme terror  upon her she clasped  child close against her breast where  could feel her heart beat like  muffled hammer then shutting her eyes she ran suddenly down  shallow bank   bayou  never stopped till she had climbed  opposite shore she stood there quivering  instant  she opened her eyes then she plunged into  footpath through  trees she spoke no more  chéri but muttered constantly “bon dieu ayez pitié la folle bon dieu ayez pitié moi” instinct seemed  guide her when  pathway spread clear  smooth enough before her she again closed her eyes tightly against  sight   unknown  terrifying world a child playing  some weeds caught sight  her  she neared  quarters the little one uttered  cry  dismay “la folle” she screamed  her piercing treble “la folle done cross de bayer” quickly  cry passed down  line  cabins “yonda la folle done cross de bayou” children old men old women young ones  infants  their arms flocked  doors  windows  see this aweinspiring spectacle most  them shuddered  superstitious dread  what  might portend “she totin’ chéri” some  them shouted some   more daring gathered about her  followed  her heels only  fall back  new terror when she turned her distorted face upon them her eyes  bloodshot   saliva had gathered   white foam  her black lips some one had run ahead  her  where p’tit maître sat  his family  guests upon  gallery “p’tit maître la folle done cross de bayou look her look her yonda totin’ chéri” this startling intimation   first which they had   woman’s approach she  now near  hand she walked  long strides her eyes  fixed desperately before her  she breathed heavily   tired ox at  foot   stairway which she could not have mounted she laid  boy  his father’s arms then  world  had looked red  la folle suddenly turned black—like  day she had seen powder  blood she reeled   instant before  sustaining arm could reach her she fell heavily   ground when la folle regained consciousness she   home again  her own cabin  upon her own bed the moon rays streaming  through  open door  windows gave what light  needed   old black mammy who stood   table concocting  tisane  fragrant herbs it  very late others who had come  found   stupor clung  her had gone again p’tit maître had been there   him doctor bonfils who said  la folle might die but death had passed her by the voice  very clear  steady  which she spoke  tante lizette brewing her tisane there   corner “ef you  give me one good drink tisane tante lizette i b’lieve i’m goin’ sleep me” and she did sleep so soundly so healthfully  old lizette without compunction stole softly away  creep back through  moonlit fields  her own cabin   new quarters the first touch   cool gray morning awoke la folle she arose calmly  if no tempest had shaken  threatened her existence but yesterday she donned her new blue cottonade  white apron  she remembered  this  sunday when she had made  herself  cup  strong black coffee  drunk   relish she quitted  cabin  walked across  old familiar field   bayou’s edge again she did not stop there  she had always done before but crossed   long steady stride  if she had done this all her life when she had made her way through  brush  scrub cottonwoodtrees  lined  opposite bank she found herself upon  border   field where  white bursting cotton   dew upon it gleamed  acres  acres like frosted silver   early dawn la folle drew  long deep breath  she gazed across  country she walked slowly  uncertainly like one who hardly knows how looking about her  she went the cabins  yesterday had sent  clamor  voices  pursue her  quiet now no one  yet astir  bellissime only  birds  darted here  there  hedges  awake  singing their matins when la folle came   broad stretch  velvety lawn  surrounded  house she moved slowly   delight over  springy turf   delicious beneath her tread she stopped  find whence came those perfumes   assailing her senses  memories   time far gone there they were stealing up  her   thousand blue violets  peeped out  green luxuriant beds there they were showering down   big waxen bells   magnolias far above her head    jessamine clumps around her there  roses too without number to right  left palms spread  broad  graceful curves it all looked like enchantment beneath  sparkling sheen  dew when la folle had slowly  cautiously mounted  many steps  led up   veranda she turned  look back   perilous ascent she had made then she caught sight   river bending like  silver bow   foot  bellissime exultation possessed her soul la folle rapped softly upon  door near  hand chéri’s mother soon cautiously opened it quickly  cleverly she dissembled  astonishment she felt  seeing la folle “ah la folle is  you so early” “oui madame i come ax how my po’ li’le chéri do ’s mo’nin’” “he  feeling easier thank you la folle dr bonfils says    nothing serious he’s sleeping now will you come back when  awakes” “non madame i’m goin’ wait yair tell chéri wake up” la folle seated herself upon  topmost step   veranda a look  wonder  deep content crept into her face  she watched   first time  sun rise upon  new  beautiful world beyond  bayou ma’ame pÉlagie i when  war began there stood  côte joyeuse  imposing mansion  red brick shaped like  pantheon a grove  majestic liveoaks surrounded it thirty years later only  thick walls  standing   dull red brick showing here  there through  matted growth  clinging vines the huge round pillars  intact so  some extent   stone flagging  hall  portico there had been no home so stately along  whole stretch  côte joyeuse every one knew that  they knew  had cost philippe valmêt sixty thousand dollars  build away back   no one   danger  forgetting  fact so long  his daughter pélagie survived she   queenly whitehaired woman  fifty “ma’ame pélagie” they called her though she  unmarried   her sister pauline  child  ma’ame pélagie’s eyes  child  thirtyfive the two lived alone   threeroomed cabin almost within  shadow   ruin they lived   dream  ma’ame pélagie’s dream which   rebuild  old home it would  pitiful  tell how their days  spent  accomplish this end how  dollars had been saved  thirty years   picayunes hoarded  yet not half enough gathered but ma’ame pélagie felt sure  twenty years  life before her  counted upon  many more  her sister and what could not come  pass  twenty—in forty—years often  pleasant afternoons  two would drink their black coffee seated upon  stoneflagged portico whose canopy   blue sky  louisiana they loved  sit there   silence  only each other   sheeny prying lizards  company talking   old times  planning   new while light breezes stirred  tattered vines high up among  columns where owls nested “we can never hope  have all just   was pauline” ma’ame pélagie would say “perhaps  marble pillars   salon  have   replaced  wooden ones   crystal candelabra left out should you  willing pauline” “oh yes sesoeur i shall  willing” it  always “yes sesoeur” or “no sesoeur” “just  you please sesoeur”  poor little mam’selle pauline for what did she remember   old life   old spendor only  faint gleam here  there  halfconsciousness   young uneventful existence  then  great crash that meant  nearness  war  revolt  slaves confusion ending  fire  flame through which she  borne safely   strong arms  pélagie  carried   log cabin which  still their home their brother léandre had known more   all than pauline  not so much  pélagie he had left  management   big plantation  all  memories  traditions  his older sister  had gone away  dwell  cities that  many years ago now léandre’s business called him frequently  upon long journeys  home  his motherless daughter  coming  stay  her aunts  côte joyeuse they talked about it sipping their coffee   ruined portico mam’selle pauline  terribly excited  flush  throbbed into her pale nervous face showed it  she locked her thin fingers   out incessantly “but what shall we do  la petite sesoeur where shall we put her how shall we amuse her ah seigneur” “she  sleep upon  cot   room next  ours” responded ma’ame pélagie “and live  we do she knows how we live  why we live her father  told her she knows we have money  could squander  if we chose do not fret pauline let us hope la petite   true valmêt” then ma’ame pélagie rose  stately deliberation  went  saddle her horse  she had yet  make her last daily round through  fields  mam’selle pauline threaded her way slowly among  tangled grasses toward  cabin the coming  la petite bringing  her  she did  pungent atmosphere   outside  dimly known world   shock  these two living their dreamlife the girl  quite  tall  her aunt pélagie  dark eyes  reflected joy   still pool reflects  light  stars  her rounded cheek  tinged like  pink crèpe myrtle mam’selle pauline kissed her  trembled ma’ame pélagie looked into her eyes   searching gaze which seemed  seek  likeness   past   living present and they made room between them  this young life ii la petite had determined upon trying  fit herself   strange narrow existence which she knew awaited her  côte joyeuse it went well enough  first sometimes she followed ma’ame pélagie into  fields  note how  cotton  opening ripe  white or  count  ears  corn upon  hardy stalks but oftener she   her aunt pauline assisting  household offices chattering  her brief past or walking   older woman arminarm under  trailing moss   giant oaks mam’selle pauline’s steps grew very buoyant  summer  her eyes  sometimes  bright   bird’s unless la petite  away  her side when they would lose all other light but one  uneasy expectancy the girl seemed  love her well  return  called her endearingly tan’tante but   time went by la petite became very quiet—not listless but thoughtful  slow  her movements then her cheeks began  pale till they  tinged like  creamy plumes   white crèpe myrtle  grew   ruin one day when she sat within  shadow between her aunts holding  hand  each she said “tante pélagie i must tell you something you  tan’tante” she spoke low but clearly  firmly “i love you both—please remember  i love you both but i must go away  you i can’t live any longer here  côte joyeuse” a spasm passed through mam’selle pauline’s delicate frame la petite could feel  twitch     wiry fingers   intertwined  her own ma’ame pélagie remained unchanged  motionless no human eye could penetrate so deep   see  satisfaction which her soul felt she said “what do you mean petite your father  sent you  us  i am sure   his wish  you remain” “my father loves me tante pélagie  such  not  his wish when  knows oh” she continued   restless movement “it   though  weight  pressing me backward here i must live another life  life i lived before i want  know things   happening  day  day over  world  hear them talked about i want my music my books my companions if i had known no other life but this one  privation i suppose  would  different if i had  live this life i should make  best  it but i do not have to  you know tante pélagie you do not need to it seems  me” she added   whisper “that    sin against myself ah tan’tante—what   matter  tan’tante” it  nothing only  slight feeling  faintness  would soon pass she entreated them  take no notice but they brought her some water  fanned her   palmetto leaf but  night   stillness   room mam’selle pauline sobbed  would not  comforted ma’ame pélagie took her  her arms “pauline my little sister pauline” she entreated “i never have seen you like this before do you no longer love me have we not been happy together you  i” “oh yes sesoeur” “is  because la petite  going away” “yes sesoeur” “then she  dearer  you than i” spoke ma’ame pélagie  sharp resentment “than i who held you  warmed you  my arms  day you  born than i your mother father sister everything  could cherish you pauline don’t tell me that” mam’selle pauline tried  talk through her sobs “i can’t explain   you sesoeur i don’t understand  myself i love you  i have always loved you next  god but if la petite goes away i shall die i can’t understand—help me sesoeur she seems—she seems like  saviour like one who had come  taken me   hand   leading me somewhere—somewhere i want  go” ma’ame pélagie had been sitting beside  bed  her peignoir  slippers she held  hand  her sister who lay there  smoothed down  woman’s soft brown hair she said not  word   silence  broken only  mam’selle pauline’s continued sobs once ma’ame pélagie arose  mix  drink  orangeflower water which she gave  her sister  she would have offered    nervous fretful child almost  hour passed before ma’ame pélagie spoke again then she said— “pauline you must cease  sobbing now  sleep you  make yourself ill la petite  not go away do you hear me do you understand she  stay i promise you” mam’selle pauline could not clearly comprehend but she had great faith   word  her sister  soothed   promise   touch  ma’ame pélagie’s strong gentle hand she fell asleep iii ma’ame pélagie when she saw  her sister slept arose noiselessly  stepped outside upon  lowroofed narrow gallery she did not linger there but   step   hurried  agitated she crossed  distance  divided her cabin   ruin the night  not  dark one   sky  clear   moon resplendent but light or dark would have made no difference  ma’ame pélagie it  not  first time she had stolen away   ruin  nighttime when  whole plantation slept but she never before had been there   heart so nearly broken she  going there   last time  dream her dreams  see  visions  hitherto had crowded her days  nights   bid them farewell there   first  them awaiting her upon  very portal  robust old whitehaired man chiding her  returning home so late there  guests   entertained does she not know it guests   city    near

ma’ame pélagie had sunk upon  bench where she  her sister so often came  sit turning she gazed  through  gaping chasm   window  her side the interior   ruin  ablaze not   moonlight    faint beside  other one—the sparkle   crystal candelabra which negroes moving noiselessly  respectfully about  lighting one after  other how  gleam  them reflects  glances   polished marble pillars the room holds  number  guests there  old monsieur lucien santien leaning against one   pillars  laughing  something which monsieur lafirme  telling him till his fat shoulders shake his son jules   him—jules who wants  marry her she laughs she wonders if félix  told her father yet there  young jérôme lafirme playing  checkers upon  sofa  léandre little pauline stands annoying them  disturbing  game léandre reproves her she begins  cry  old black clementine her nurse who  not far off limps across  room  pick her up  carry her away how sensitive  little one is but she trots about  takes care  herself better than she did  year or two ago when she fell upon  stone hall floor  raised  great “bobo”  her forehead pélagie  hurt  angry enough about it  she ordered rugs  buffalo robes   brought  laid thick upon  tiles till  little one’s steps  surer “il ne faut pas faire mal à pauline” she  saying  aloud—“faire mal  pauline” but she gazes beyond  salon back into  big dining hall where  white crèpe myrtle grows ha how low  bat  circled it  struck ma’ame pélagie full   breast she does not know it she  beyond there   dining hall where her father sits   group  friends over their wine as usual they  talking politics how tiresome she  heard them say “la guerre” oftener than once la guerre bah she  félix have something pleasanter  talk about out under  oaks or back   shadow   oleanders but they  right the sound   cannon shot  sumter  rolled across  southern states   echo  heard along  whole stretch  côte joyeuse yet pélagie does not believe it not till la ricaneuse stands before her  bare black arms akimbo uttering  volley  vile abuse   brazen impudence pélagie wants  kill her but yet she  not believe not till félix comes  her   chamber above  dining hall—there where  trumpet vine hangs—comes  say goodby  her the hurt which  big brass buttons  his new gray uniform pressed into  tender flesh  her bosom  never left it she sits upon  sofa   beside her both speechless  pain that room would not have been altered even  sofa would have been there   same spot  ma’ame pélagie had meant all along  thirty years all along  lie there upon  some day when  time came  die but there  no time  weep   enemy   door the door  been no barrier they  clattering through  halls now drinking  wines shattering  crystal  glass slashing  portraits one  them stands before her  tells her  leave

louisiana can perish before her conquerors but little pauline clings  her knees   agony  terror little pauline must  saved “il ne faut pas faire mal à pauline” again she  saying  aloud—“faire mal à pauline” the night  nearly spent ma’ame pélagie had glided   bench upon which she had rested   hours lay prone upon  stone flagging motionless when she dragged herself  her feet    walk like one   dream about  great solemn pillars one after  other she reached her arms  pressed her cheek  her lips upon  senseless brick “adieu adieu” whispered ma’ame pélagie there  no longer  moon  guide her steps across  familiar pathway   cabin the brightest light   sky  venus  swung low   east the bats had ceased  beat their wings about  ruin even  mockingbird  had warbled  hours   old mulberrytree had sung himself asleep that darkest hour before  day  mantling  earth ma’ame pélagie hurried through  wet clinging grass beating aside  heavy moss  swept across her face walking  toward  cabin—toward pauline not once did she look back upon  ruin  brooded like  huge monster—a black spot   darkness  enveloped it iv little more than  year later  transformation which  old valmêt place had undergone

little more than  baby herself when monsieur  riding through  gateway  valmondé had found her lying asleep   shadow   big stone pillar the little one awoke  his arms  began  cry  “dada” that   much  she could do or say some people thought she might have strayed there  her own accord  she    toddling age the prevailing belief   she had been purposely left   party  texans whose canvascovered wagon late   day had crossed  ferry  coton maïs kept just below  plantation in time madame valmondé abandoned every speculation but  one  désirée had been sent  her   beneficent providence    child  her affection seeing  she  without child   flesh for  girl grew   beautiful  gentle affectionate  sincere—the idol  valmondé it  no wonder when she stood one day against  stone pillar  whose shadow she had lain asleep eighteen years before  armand aubigny riding   seeing her there had fallen  love  her that   way all  aubignys fell  love  if struck   pistol shot the wonder    had not loved her before   had known her since his father brought him home  paris  boy  eight after his mother died there the passion  awoke  him  day when  saw her   gate swept along like  avalanche or like  prairie fire or like anything  drives headlong over all obstacles monsieur valmondé grew practical  wanted things well considered  is  girl’s obscure origin armand looked into her eyes  did not care he  reminded  she  nameless what did  matter about  name when  could give her one   oldest  proudest  louisiana he ordered  corbeille  paris  contained himself  what patience  could until  arrived then they  married madame valmondé had not seen désirée   baby  four weeks when she reached l’abri she shuddered   first sight  it  she always did it   sad looking place which  many years had not known  gentle presence   mistress old monsieur aubigny having married  buried his wife  france  she having loved her own land too well ever  leave it the roof came down steep  black like  cowl reaching out beyond  wide galleries  encircled  yellow stuccoed house big solemn oaks grew close  it  their thickleaved farreaching branches shadowed  like  pall young aubigny’s rule   strict one too  under  his negroes had forgotten how   gay  they had been during  old master’s easygoing  indulgent lifetime the young mother  recovering slowly  lay full length  her soft white muslins  laces upon  couch the baby  beside her upon her arm where  had fallen asleep  her breast the yellow nurse woman sat beside  window fanning herself madame valmondé bent her portly figure over désirée  kissed her holding her  instant tenderly  her arms then she turned   child “this  not  baby” she exclaimed  startled tones french   language spoken  valmondé  those days “i knew you would  astonished” laughed désirée “at  way   grown the little cochon de lait look  his legs mamma  his hands  fingernails—real fingernails zandrine had  cut them this morning isn’t  true zandrine” the woman bowed her turbaned head majestically “mais si madame” “and  way  cries” went  désirée “is deafening armand heard him  other day  far away  la blanche’s cabin” madame valmondé had never removed her eyes   child she lifted   walked   over   window   lightest she scanned  baby narrowly then looked  searchingly  zandrine whose face  turned  gaze across  fields “yes  child  grown  changed” said madame valmondé slowly  she replaced  beside  mother “what does armand say” désirée’s face became suffused   glow   happiness itself “oh armand   proudest father   parish i believe chiefly because    boy  bear his name though  says not—that  would have loved  girl  well but i know  isn’t true i know  says   please me and mamma” she added drawing madame valmondé’s head down  her  speaking   whisper “he hasn’t punished one  them—not one  them—since baby  born even négrillon who pretended  have burnt his leg   might rest  work—he only laughed  said négrillon   great scamp oh mamma i’m so happy  frightens me” what désirée said  true marriage  later  birth  his son had softened armand aubigny’s imperious  exacting nature greatly this  what made  gentle désirée so happy  she loved him desperately when  frowned she trembled but loved him when  smiled she asked no greater blessing  god but armand’s dark handsome face had not often been disfigured  frowns since  day  fell  love  her when  baby  about three months old désirée awoke one day   conviction  there  something   air menacing her peace it   first too subtle  grasp it had only been  disquieting suggestion  air  mystery among  blacks unexpected visits  faroff neighbors who could hardly account  their coming then  strange  awful change  her husband’s manner which she dared not ask him  explain when  spoke  her    averted eyes  which  old lovelight seemed  have gone out he absented himself  home  when there avoided her presence    her child without excuse and  very spirit  satan seemed suddenly  take hold  him  his dealings   slaves désirée  miserable enough  die she sat  her room one hot afternoon  her peignoir listlessly drawing through her fingers  strands  her long silky brown hair  hung about her shoulders the baby half naked lay asleep upon her own great mahogany bed   like  sumptuous throne   satinlined halfcanopy one  la blanche’s little quadroon boys—half naked too—stood fanning  child slowly   fan  peacock feathers désirée’s eyes had been fixed absently  sadly upon  baby while she  striving  penetrate  threatening mist  she felt closing about her she looked  her child   boy who stood beside him  back again over  over “ah” it   cry  she could not help which she  not conscious  having uttered the blood turned like ice  her veins   clammy moisture gathered upon her face she tried  speak   little quadroon boy but no sound would come  first when  heard his name uttered  looked up  his mistress  pointing   door he laid aside  great soft fan  obediently stole away over  polished floor  his bare tiptoes she stayed motionless  gaze riveted upon her child  her face  picture  fright presently her husband entered  room  without noticing her went   table  began  search among some papers which covered it “armand” she called  him   voice which must have stabbed him if   human but  did not notice “armand” she said again then she rose  tottered towards him “armand” she panted once more clutching his arm “look  our child what does  mean tell me” he coldly but gently loosened her fingers  about his arm  thrust  hand away  him “tell me what  means” she cried despairingly “it means”  answered lightly “that  child  not white  means  you  not white” a quick conception  all  this accusation meant  her nerved her  unwonted courage  deny it “it   lie   not true i am white look  my hair   brown  my eyes  gray armand you know they  gray and my skin  fair” seizing his wrist “look  my hand whiter than yours armand” she laughed hysterically “as white  la blanche’s”  returned cruelly  went away leaving her alone  their child when she could hold  pen  her hand she sent  despairing letter  madame valmondé “my mother they tell me i am not white armand  told me i am not white for god’s sake tell them   not true you must know   not true i shall die i must die i cannot  so unhappy  live” the answer  came  brief “my own désirée come home  valmondé back  your mother who loves you come  your child” when  letter reached désirée she went    her husband’s study  laid  open upon  desk before which  sat she  like  stone image silent white motionless after she placed  there in silence  ran his cold eyes over  written words he said nothing “shall i go armand” she asked  tones sharp  agonized suspense “yes go” “do you want me  go” “yes i want you  go” he thought almighty god had dealt cruelly  unjustly  him  felt somehow    paying him back  kind when  stabbed thus into his wife’s soul moreover  no longer loved her because   unconscious injury she had brought upon his home  his name she turned away like one stunned   blow  walked slowly towards  door hoping  would call her back “goodby armand” she moaned he did not answer her that  his last blow  fate désirée went  search  her child zandrine  pacing  sombre gallery  it she took  little one   nurse’s arms  no word  explanation  descending  steps walked away under  liveoak branches it   october afternoon  sun  just sinking out   still fields  negroes  picking cotton désirée had not changed  thin white garment nor  slippers which she wore her hair  uncovered   sun’s rays brought  golden gleam   brown meshes she did not take  broad beaten road which led   faroff plantation  valmondé she walked across  deserted field where  stubble bruised her tender feet so delicately shod  tore her thin gown  shreds she disappeared among  reeds

never know  his mother who adores him belongs   race   cursed   brand  slavery” a respectable woman mrs baroda   little provoked  learn  her husband expected his friend gouvernail up  spend  week or two   plantation they had entertained  good deal during  winter much   time had also been passed  new orleans  various forms  mild dissipation she  looking forward   period  unbroken rest now  undisturbed têteàtête  her husband when  informed her  gouvernail  coming up  stay  week or two this   man she had heard much  but never seen he had been her husband’s college friend  now  journalist   no sense  society man or “a man about town” which were perhaps some   reasons she had never met him but she had unconsciously formed  image  him  her mind she pictured him tall slim cynical  eyeglasses  his hands  his pockets  she did not like him gouvernail  slim enough but  wasn’t very tall nor very cynical neither did  wear eyeglasses nor carry his hands  his pockets and she rather liked him when  first presented himself but why she liked him she could not explain satisfactorily  herself when she partly attempted  do so she could discover  him none  those brilliant  promising traits which gaston her husband had often assured her   possessed on  contrary  sat rather mute  receptive before her chatty eagerness  make him feel  home   face  gaston’s frank  wordy hospitality his manner   courteous toward her   most exacting woman could require but  made no direct appeal  her approval or even esteem once settled   plantation  seemed  like  sit upon  wide portico   shade  one   big corinthian pillars smoking his cigar lazily  listening attentively  gaston’s experience   sugar planter “this  what i call living”  would utter  deep satisfaction   air  swept across  sugar field caressed him   warm  scented velvety touch it pleased him also  get  familiar terms   big dogs  came about him rubbing themselves sociably against his legs he did not care  fish  displayed no eagerness  go out  kill grosbecs when gaston proposed doing so gouvernail’s personality puzzled mrs baroda but she liked him indeed    lovable inoffensive fellow after  few days when she could understand him no better than  first she gave over being puzzled  remained piqued in this mood she left her husband  her guest   most part alone together then finding  gouvernail took no manner  exception  her action she imposed her society upon him accompanying him  his idle strolls   mill  walks along  batture she persistently sought  penetrate  reserve  which  had unconsciously enveloped himself “when   going—your friend” she one day asked her husband “for my part  tires me frightfully” “not   week yet dear i can’t understand  gives you no trouble” “no i should like him better if  did if   more like others  i had  plan somewhat  his comfort  enjoyment” gaston took his wife’s pretty face between his hands  looked tenderly  laughingly into her troubled eyes they  making  bit  toilet sociably together  mrs baroda’s dressingroom “you  full  surprises ma belle”  said  her “even i can never count upon how you  going  act under given conditions” he kissed her  turned  fasten his cravat before  mirror “here you are”  went on “taking poor gouvernail seriously  making  commotion over him  last thing  would desire or expect” “commotion” she hotly resented “nonsense how can you say such  thing commotion indeed but you know you said   clever” “so  is but  poor fellow  run down  overwork now that’s why i asked him here  take  rest” “you used  say    man  ideas” she retorted unconciliated “i expected him   interesting  least i’m going   city   morning  have my spring gowns fitted let me know when mr gouvernail  gone i shall   my aunt octavie’s” that night she went  sat alone upon  bench  stood beneath  live oak tree   edge   gravel walk she had never known her thoughts or her intentions   so confused she could gather nothing  them but  feeling   distinct necessity  quit her home   morning mrs baroda heard footsteps crunching  gravel but could discern   darkness only  approaching red point   lighted cigar she knew   gouvernail  her husband did not smoke she hoped  remain unnoticed but her white gown revealed her  him he threw away his cigar  seated himself upon  bench beside her without  suspicion  she might object  his presence “your husband told me  bring this  you mrs baroda”  said handing her  filmy white scarf  which she sometimes enveloped her head  shoulders she accepted  scarf  him   murmur  thanks  let  lie  her lap he made some commonplace observation upon  baneful effect   night air   season then  his gaze reached out into  darkness  murmured half  himself “‘night  south winds—night   large few stars still nodding night—’” she made no reply  this apostrophe   night which indeed  not addressed  her gouvernail   no sense  diffident man    not  selfconscious one his periods  reserve  not constitutional but  result  moods sitting there beside mrs baroda his silence melted   time he talked freely  intimately   low hesitating drawl   not unpleasant  hear he talked   old college days when   gaston had been  good deal  each other   days  keen  blind ambitions  large intentions now there  left  him  least  philosophic acquiescence   existing order—only  desire   permitted  exist  now  then  little whiff  genuine life such    breathing now her mind only vaguely grasped what   saying her physical being    moment predominant she  not thinking  his words only drinking   tones  his voice she wanted  reach out her hand   darkness  touch him   sensitive tips  her fingers upon  face or  lips she wanted  draw close  him  whisper against his cheek—she did not care what—as she might have done if she had not been  respectable woman the stronger  impulse grew  bring herself near him  further  fact did she draw away  him as soon  she could do so without  appearance  too great rudeness she rose  left him there alone before she reached  house gouvernail had lighted  fresh cigar  ended his apostrophe   night mrs baroda  greatly tempted  night  tell her husband—who  also her friend—of this folly  had seized her but she did not yield   temptation beside being  respectable woman she   very sensible one  she knew there  some battles  life which  human being must fight alone when gaston arose   morning his wife had already departed she had taken  early morning train   city she did not return till gouvernail  gone  under her roof there  some talk  having him back during  summer  followed that is gaston greatly desired it but this desire yielded  his wife’s strenuous opposition however before  year ended she proposed wholly  herself  have gouvernail visit them again her husband  surprised  delighted   suggestion coming  her “i am glad chère amie  know  you have finally overcome your dislike  him truly  did not deserve it” “oh” she told him laughingly after pressing  long tender kiss upon his lips “i have overcome everything you  see this time i shall  very nice  him” the kiss it  still quite light out  doors but inside   curtains drawn   smouldering fire sending out  dim uncertain glow  room  full  deep shadows brantain

talking low  indifferent things which plainly  not  things  occupied their thoughts she knew   loved her—a frank blustering fellow without guile enough  conceal his feelings  no desire  do so for two weeks past  had sought her society eagerly  persistently she  confidently waiting  him  declare himself  she meant  accept him the rather insignificant  unattractive brantain  enormously rich  she liked  required  entourage which wealth could give her during one   pauses between their talk   last tea   next reception  door opened   young man entered whom brantain knew quite well the girl turned her face toward him a stride or two brought him  her side  bending over her chair—before she could suspect his intention  she did not realize   had not seen her visitor—he pressed  ardent lingering kiss upon her lips brantain slowly arose so did  girl arise but quickly   newcomer stood between them  little amusement  some defiance struggling   confusion  his face “i believe” stammered brantain “i see  i have stayed too long i—i had no idea—that is i must wish you goodby” he  clutching his hat  both hands  probably did not perceive  she  extending her hand  him her presence  mind had not completely deserted her but she could not have trusted herself  speak “hang me if i saw him sitting there nattie i know it’s deuced awkward  you but i hope you’ll forgive me this once—this very first break why what’s  matter” “don’t touch me don’t come near me” she returned angrily “what do you mean  entering  house without ringing” “i came   your brother  i often do”  answered coldly  selfjustification “we came   side way he went upstairs  i came  here hoping  find you the explanation  simple enough  ought  satisfy you   misadventure  unavoidable but do say  you forgive me nathalie”  entreated softening “forgive you you don’t know what you  talking about let me pass it depends upon—a good deal whether i ever forgive you” at  next reception which she  brantain had been talking about she approached  young man   delicious frankness  manner when she saw him there “will you let me speak  you  moment or two mr brantain” she asked   engaging but perturbed smile he seemed extremely unhappy but when she took his arm  walked away  him seeking  retired corner  ray  hope mingled   almost comical misery  his expression she  apparently very outspoken “perhaps i should not have sought this interview mr brantain but—but oh i have been very uncomfortable almost miserable since  little encounter  other afternoon when i thought how you might have misinterpreted it  believed things”—hope  plainly gaining  ascendancy over misery  brantain’s round guileless face—“of course i know   nothing  you but  my own sake i do want you  understand  mr harvy   intimate friend  long standing why we have always been like cousins—like brother  sister i may say he  my brother’s most intimate associate  often fancies    entitled   same privileges   family oh i know   absurd uncalled for  tell you this undignified even” she  almost weeping “but  makes so much difference  me what you think of—of me” her voice had grown very low  agitated the misery had all disappeared  brantain’s face “then you do really care what i think miss nathalie may i call you miss nathalie” they turned into  long dim corridor   lined  either side  tall graceful plants they walked slowly   very end  it when they turned  retrace their steps brantain’s face  radiant  hers  triumphant harvy  among  guests   wedding   sought her out   rare moment when she stood alone “your husband”  said smiling “has sent me over  kiss you” a quick blush suffused her face  round polished throat “i suppose it’s natural   man  feel  act generously   occasion  this kind he tells me  doesn’t want his marriage  interrupt wholly  pleasant intimacy which  existed between you  me i don’t know what you’ve been telling him”   insolent smile “but   sent me here  kiss you” she felt like  chess player who   clever handling  his pieces sees  game taking  course intended her eyes  bright  tender   smile  they glanced up into his  her lips looked hungry   kiss which they invited “but you know”  went  quietly “i didn’t tell him so  would have seemed ungrateful but i can tell you i’ve stopped kissing women it’s dangerous” well she had brantain  his million left a person can’t have everything  this world

precious  material things sometimes   being forever identified   significant moment  one’s existence a hundred times she had read over  letter  which  locket had come back  her no later than  morning she had again pored over it as she sat beside  window smoothing  letter out upon her knee heavy  spiced odors stole   her   songs  birds   humming  insects   air she  so young   world  so beautiful  there came over her  sense  unreality  she read again  again  priest’s letter he told   autumn day drawing   close   gold   red fading out   west   night gathering  shadows  cover  faces   dead oh she could not believe  one  those dead  her own  visage uplifted   gray sky   agony  supplication a spasm  resistance  rebellion seized  swept over her why   spring here   flowers   seductive breath if

enveloped her “i shall grow old  quiet  sad like poor aunt tavie” she murmured  herself  she folded  letter  replaced    secretary already she gave herself  little demure air like her aunt tavie she walked   slow glide  unconscious imitation  mademoiselle tavie whom some youthful affliction had robbed  earthly compensation while leaving her  possession  youth’s illusions as she sat   old cabriolet beside  father  her dead lover again there came  octavie  terrible sense  loss which had assailed her so often before the soul  her youth clamored   rights   share   world’s glory  exultation she leaned back  drew her veil  little closer about her face it   old black veil  her aunt tavie’s a whiff  dust   road had blown   she wiped her cheeks  her eyes  her soft white handkerchief  homemade handkerchief fabricated  one  her old fine muslin petticoats “will you do me  favor octavie” requested  judge   courteous tone which  never abandoned “to remove  veil which you wear it seems out  harmony someway   beauty  promise   day” the young girl obediently yielded  her old companion’s wish  unpinning  cumbersome sombre drapery  her bonnet folded  neatly  laid  upon  seat  front  her “ah   better far better”  said   tone expressing unbounded relief “never put   again dear” octavie felt  little hurt  if  wished  debar her  share  parcel   burden  affliction which

scent   heavy blossoms met them like  soft  tender embrace  welcome as they neared  house  old gentleman placed  arm around  girl’s shoulders  turning her face up  him  said “do you not think    day like this miracles might happen when  whole earth  vibrant  life does  not seem  you octavie  heaven might  once relent  give us back our dead” he spoke very low advisedly  impressively in his voice
