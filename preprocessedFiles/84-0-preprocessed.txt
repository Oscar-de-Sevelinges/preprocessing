possession last monday july st we  nearly surrounded  ice which closed   ship  all sides scarcely leaving her  searoom  which she floated our situation  somewhat dangerous especially  we  compassed round   very thick fog we accordingly lay to hoping  some change would take place   atmosphere  weather about two o’clock  mist cleared away  we beheld stretched out  every direction vast  irregular plains  ice which seemed  have no end some  my comrades groaned  my own mind began  grow watchful  anxious thoughts when  strange sight suddenly attracted our attention  diverted our solicitude  our own situation we perceived  low carriage fixed   sledge  drawn  dogs pass  towards  north   distance  half  mile  being which had  shape   man but apparently  gigantic stature sat   sledge  guided  dogs we watched  rapid progress   traveller  our telescopes until   lost among  distant inequalities   ice this appearance excited our unqualified wonder we were  we believed many hundred miles  any

this occurrence we heard  ground sea  before night  ice broke  freed our ship we however lay  until  morning fearing  encounter   dark those large loose masses which float about after  breaking up   ice i profited  this time  rest   few hours in  morning however  soon    light i went upon deck  found all  sailors busy  one side   vessel apparently talking  someone   sea it was  fact  sledge like  we had seen before which had drifted towards us   night   large fragment  ice only one dog remained alive but there   human being within  whom  sailors  persuading  enter  vessel he  not   other traveller seemed  be  savage inhabitant  some undiscovered island but  european when i appeared  deck  master said “here  our captain    not allow you  perish   open sea” on perceiving me  stranger addressed me  english although   foreign accent “before i come  board your vessel” said he “will you have  kindness  inform me whither you  bound” you may conceive my astonishment  hearing such  question addressed  me   man   brink  destruction   whom i should have supposed  my vessel would have been  resource which  would not have exchanged   most precious wealth  earth can afford i replied however  we    voyage  discovery towards  northern pole upon hearing this  appeared satisfied  consented  come  board good god margaret if you had seen  man who thus capitulated  his safety your surprise would have been boundless his limbs  nearly frozen  his body dreadfully emaciated  fatigue  suffering i never saw  man  so wretched  condition we attempted  carry him into  cabin but  soon   had quitted  fresh air  fainted we accordingly brought him back   deck  restored him  animation  rubbing him  brandy  forcing him  swallow  small quantity as soon   showed signs  life we wrapped him up  blankets  placed him near  chimney   kitchen stove by slow degrees  recovered  ate  little soup which restored him wonderfully two days passed  this manner before   able  speak  i often feared  his sufferings had deprived him  understanding when  had  some measure recovered i removed him  my own cabin  attended  him  much  my duty would permit i never saw  more interesting creature his eyes have generally  expression  wildness  even madness but there  moments when if anyone performs  act  kindness towards him or does him any  most trifling service his whole countenance  lighted up   were   beam  benevolence  sweetness  i never saw equalled but   generally melancholy  despairing  sometimes  gnashes his teeth  if impatient   weight  woes  oppresses him when my guest   little recovered i had great trouble  keep off  men who wished  ask him  thousand questions but i would not allow him   tormented  their idle curiosity   state  body  mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose once however  lieutenant asked why  had come so far upon  ice  so strange  vehicle his countenance instantly assumed  aspect   deepest gloom   replied “to seek one who fled  me” “and did  man whom you pursued travel   same fashion” “yes” “then i fancy we have seen him   day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing  sledge   man  it across  ice” this aroused  stranger’s attention   asked  multitude  questions concerning  route which  dæmon   called him had pursued soon after when   alone  me  said “i have doubtless excited your curiosity  well    these good people but you  too considerate  make inquiries” “certainly  would indeed  very impertinent  inhuman  me  trouble you  any inquisitiveness  mine” “and yet you rescued me   strange  perilous situation you have benevolently restored me  life” soon after this  inquired if i thought   breaking up   ice had destroyed  other sledge i replied  i could not answer  any degree  certainty   ice had not broken until near midnight   traveller might have arrived   place  safety before  time but  this i could not judge from this time  new spirit  life animated  decaying frame   stranger he manifested  greatest

my madness have you drunk also   intoxicating draught hear me let me reveal my tale  you  dash  cup  your lips” such words you may imagine strongly excited my curiosity but  paroxysm  grief  had seized  stranger overcame his weakened powers  many hours  repose  tranquil conversation  necessary  restore his composure having conquered  violence  his feelings  appeared  despise himself  being

enjoy this blessing “i agree  you” replied  stranger “we  unfashioned creatures but half made up if one wiser better dearer than ourselves—such  friend ought  be—do not lend his aid  perfectionate our

entirely exploded    modern system  science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than  ancient because  powers   latter  chimerical while those   former  real  practical under such

ineffectual destiny  too potent  her immutable laws had decreed my utter  terrible destruction chapter  when i had attained  age  seventeen my parents resolved  i should become  student   university  ingolstadt i had hitherto attended  schools  geneva but my father thought  necessary   completion  my education  i should  made acquainted  other customs than those  my native country my departure  therefore fixed   early date but before  day resolved upon could arrive  first misfortune  my life occurred—an omen   were  my future misery elizabeth had caught  scarlet fever her illness  severe  she    greatest danger during her illness many arguments had been urged  persuade my mother  refrain  attending upon her she had  first yielded  our entreaties but when she heard   life  her favourite  menaced she could no longer control her anxiety she attended her sickbed her watchful attentions triumphed over  malignity   distemper—elizabeth  saved but  consequences  this imprudence  fatal  her preserver on  third day my mother sickened her fever  accompanied   most alarming symptoms   looks  her medical attendants prognosticated  worst event on her deathbed  fortitude  benignity  this best  women did not desert her she joined  hands  elizabeth  myself “my children” she said “my firmest hopes  future happiness  placed   prospect  your union this expectation  now   consolation  your father elizabeth my love you must supply my place  my younger children alas i regret  i am taken  you and happy  beloved  i have been   not hard  quit you all but these  not thoughts befitting me i  endeavour  resign myself cheerfully  death   indulge  hope  meeting you  another world” she died calmly  her countenance expressed affection even  death i need not describe  feelings  those whose dearest ties  rent   most irreparable evil  void  presents itself   soul   despair   exhibited   countenance it  so long before  mind can persuade itself  she whom we saw every day  whose very existence appeared  part  our own can have departed  ever—that  brightness   beloved eye can have been extinguished   sound   voice so familiar  dear   ear can  hushed never more   heard these   reflections   first days but when  lapse  time proves  reality   evil then  actual bitterness  grief commences yet  whom  not  rude hand rent away some dear connection and why should i describe  sorrow which all have felt  must feel the time  length arrives when grief  rather  indulgence than  necessity   smile  plays upon  lips although  may  deemed  sacrilege  not banished my mother  dead but we had still duties which we ought  perform we must continue our course   rest  learn  think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom  spoiler  not seized my departure  ingolstadt which had been deferred  these events  now again determined upon i obtained  my father  respite  some weeks it appeared  me sacrilege so soon  leave  repose akin  death   house  mourning   rush into  thick  life i  new  sorrow but  did not  less alarm me i  unwilling  quit  sight  those  remained  me  above all i desired  see my sweet elizabeth  some degree consoled she indeed veiled her grief  strove  act  comforter  us all she looked steadily  life  assumed  duties  courage  zeal she devoted herself  those whom she had been taught  call her uncle  cousins never  she so enchanting   this time when she recalled  sunshine  her smiles  spent them upon us she forgot even her own regret  her endeavours  make us forget the day  my departure  length arrived clerval spent  last evening  us he had endeavoured  persuade his father  permit him  accompany me   become my fellow student but  vain his father   narrowminded trader  saw idleness  ruin   aspirations  ambition  his son henry deeply felt  misfortune  being debarred   liberal education he said little but when  spoke i read  his kindling eye   his animated glance  restrained but firm resolve not   chained   miserable details  commerce we sat late we could not tear ourselves away  each other nor persuade ourselves  say  word “farewell” it  said  we retired under  pretence  seeking repose each fancying   other  deceived but when  morning’s dawn i descended   carriage which   convey me away they  all there—my father again  bless me clerval  press my hand once more my elizabeth  renew her entreaties  i would write often   bestow  last feminine attentions  her playmate  friend i threw myself into  chaise    convey me away  indulged   most melancholy reflections i who had ever been surrounded  amiable companions continually engaged  endeavouring  bestow mutual pleasure—i  now alone in  university whither i  going i must form my own friends   my own protector my life had hitherto been remarkably secluded  domestic  this had given me invincible repugnance  new countenances i loved my brothers elizabeth  clerval these  “old familiar faces” but i believed myself totally unfitted   company  strangers such  my reflections  i commenced my journey but  i proceeded my spirits  hopes rose i ardently desired  acquisition  knowledge i had often when  home thought  hard  remain during my youth cooped up  one place  had longed  enter  world  take my station among other human beings now my desires  complied with   would indeed have been folly  repent i had sufficient leisure  these  many other reflections during my journey  ingolstadt which  long  fatiguing at length  high white steeple   town met my eyes i alighted   conducted  my solitary apartment  spend  evening  i pleased the next morning i delivered my letters  introduction  paid  visit  some   principal professors chance—or rather  evil influence  angel  destruction which asserted omnipotent sway over me   moment i turned my reluctant steps  my father’s door—led me first  m krempe professor  natural philosophy he   uncouth man but deeply imbued   secrets  his science he asked me several questions concerning my progress   different branches  science appertaining  natural philosophy i replied carelessly  partly  contempt mentioned  names  my alchemists   principal authors i had studied the professor stared “have you”  said “really spent your time  studying such nonsense” i replied   affirmative “every minute” continued m krempe  warmth “every instant  you have wasted  those books  utterly  entirely lost you have burdened your memory  exploded systems  useless names good god in what desert land have you lived where no one  kind enough  inform you  these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed   thousand years old   musty  they  ancient i little expected  this enlightened  scientific age  find  disciple  albertus magnus  paracelsus my dear sir you must begin your studies entirely anew” so saying  stepped aside  wrote down  list  several books treating  natural philosophy which  desired me  procure  dismissed me after mentioning    beginning   following week  intended  commence  course  lectures upon natural philosophy   general relations   m waldman  fellow professor would lecture upon chemistry  alternate days   omitted i returned home not disappointed  i have said  i had long considered those authors useless whom  professor reprobated but i returned not  all  more inclined  recur  these studies  any shape m krempe   little squat man   gruff voice   repulsive countenance  teacher therefore did not prepossess me  favour  his pursuits in rather  too philosophical  connected  strain perhaps i have given  account   conclusions i had come  concerning them  my early years as  child i had not been content   results promised   modern professors  natural science with  confusion  ideas only   accounted   my extreme youth  my want   guide  such matters i had retrod  steps  knowledge along  paths  time  exchanged  discoveries  recent inquirers   dreams  forgotten alchemists besides i had  contempt   uses  modern natural philosophy it  very different when  masters   science sought immortality  power such views although futile  grand but now  scene  changed the ambition   inquirer seemed  limit itself   annihilation  those visions  which my interest  science  chiefly founded i  required  exchange chimeras  boundless grandeur  realities  little worth such  my reflections during  first two or three days  my residence  ingolstadt which  chiefly spent  becoming acquainted   localities   principal residents  my new abode but   ensuing week commenced i thought   information which m krempe had given me concerning  lectures and although i could not consent  go  hear  little conceited fellow deliver sentences out   pulpit i recollected what  had said  m waldman whom i had never seen   had hitherto been out  town partly  curiosity  partly  idleness i went into  lecturing room which m waldman entered shortly after this professor  very unlike his colleague he appeared about fifty years  age but   aspect expressive   greatest benevolence  few grey hairs covered his temples but those   back  his head  nearly black his person  short but remarkably erect  his voice  sweetest i had ever heard he began his lecture   recapitulation   history  chemistry   various improvements made  different men  learning pronouncing  fervour  names   most distinguished discoverers he then took  cursory view   present state   science  explained many   elementary terms after having made  few preparatory experiments  concluded   panegyric upon modern chemistry  terms  which i shall never forget “the ancient teachers  this science” said he “promised impossibilities  performed nothing the modern masters promise very little they know  metals cannot  transmuted    elixir  life   chimera but these philosophers whose hands seem only made  dabble  dirt  their eyes  pore over  microscope or crucible have indeed performed miracles they penetrate into  recesses  nature  show how she works  her hidingplaces they ascend into  heavens they have discovered how  blood circulates   nature   air we breathe they have acquired new  almost unlimited powers they can command  thunders  heaven mimic  earthquake  even mock  invisible world   own shadows” such   professor’s words—rather let me say such  words   fate—enounced  destroy me as  went  i felt  if my soul  grappling   palpable enemy one  one  various keys  touched which formed  mechanism  my being chord after chord  sounded  soon my mind  filled  one thought one conception one purpose so much  been done exclaimed  soul  frankenstein—more far more  i achieve treading   steps already marked i  pioneer  new way explore unknown powers  unfold   world  deepest mysteries  creation i closed not my eyes  night my internal being    state  insurrection  turmoil i felt  order would thence arise but i had no power  produce it by degrees after  morning’s dawn sleep came i awoke  my yesternight’s thoughts    dream there only remained  resolution  return  my ancient studies   devote myself   science  which i believed myself  possess  natural talent on  same day i paid m waldman  visit his manners  private  even more mild  attractive than  public  there   certain dignity  his mien during his lecture which  his own house  replaced   greatest affability  kindness i gave him pretty nearly  same account  my former pursuits  i had given  his fellow professor he heard  attention  little narration concerning my studies  smiled   names  cornelius agrippa  paracelsus but without  contempt  m krempe had exhibited he said  “these  men  whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers  indebted  most   foundations  their knowledge they had left  us   easier task  give new names  arrange  connected classifications  facts which they   great degree had been  instruments  bringing  light the labours  men  genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail  ultimately turning   solid advantage  mankind” i listened  his statement which  delivered without any presumption or affectation  then added  his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists i expressed myself  measured terms   modesty  deference due   youth  his instructor without letting escape inexperience  life would have made me ashamed any   enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours i requested his advice concerning  books i ought  procure “i am happy” said m waldman “to have gained  disciple  if your application equals your ability i have no doubt  your success chemistry   branch  natural philosophy  which  greatest improvements have been  may  made     account  i have made  my peculiar study but   same time i have not neglected  other branches  science a man would make but  very sorry chemist if  attended   department  human knowledge alone if your wish   become really  man  science  not merely  petty experimentalist i should advise you  apply  every branch  natural philosophy including mathematics” he then took me into his laboratory  explained  me  uses  his various machines instructing me   what i ought  procure  promising me  use  his own when i should have advanced far enough   science not  derange their mechanism he also gave me  list  books which i had requested  i took my leave thus ended  day memorable  me  decided my future destiny chapter  from this day natural philosophy  particularly chemistry   most comprehensive sense   term became nearly my sole occupation i read  ardour those works so full  genius  discrimination which modern inquirers have written  these subjects i attended  lectures  cultivated  acquaintance   men  science   university  i found even  m krempe  great deal  sound sense  real information combined   true   repulsive physiognomy  manners but not   account  less valuable in m waldman i found  true friend his gentleness  never tinged  dogmatism  his instructions  given   air  frankness  good nature  banished every idea  pedantry in  thousand ways  smoothed  me  path  knowledge  made  most abstruse inquiries clear  facile  my apprehension my application   first fluctuating  uncertain  gained strength  i proceeded  soon became so ardent  eager   stars often disappeared   light  morning whilst i  yet engaged  my laboratory as i applied so closely  may  easily conceived  my progress  rapid my ardour  indeed  astonishment   students  my proficiency    masters professor krempe often asked me   sly smile how cornelius agrippa went on whilst m waldman expressed  most heartfelt exultation  my progress two years passed  this manner during which i paid no visit  geneva but  engaged heart  soul   pursuit  some discoveries which i hoped  make none but those who have experienced them can conceive   enticements  science in other studies you go  far  others have gone before you  there  nothing more  know but   scientific pursuit there  continual food  discovery  wonder a mind  moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive  great proficiency   study  i who continually sought  attainment  one object  pursuit   solely wrapped up  this improved so rapidly    end  two years i made some discoveries   improvement  some chemical instruments which procured me great esteem  admiration   university when i had arrived  this point  had become  well acquainted   theory  practice  natural philosophy  depended   lessons  any   professors  ingolstadt my residence there being no longer conducive  my improvements i thought  returning  my friends  my native town when  incident happened  protracted my stay one   phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention   structure   human frame and indeed any animal endued  life whence i often asked myself did  principle  life proceed it   bold question  one which  ever been considered   mystery yet  how many things  we upon  brink  becoming acquainted if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries i revolved these circumstances  my mind  determined thenceforth  apply myself more particularly  those branches  natural philosophy which relate  physiology unless i had been animated   almost supernatural enthusiasm my application  this study would have been irksome  almost intolerable to examine  causes  life we must first have recourse  death i became acquainted   science  anatomy but this  not sufficient i must also observe  natural decay  corruption   human body in my education my father had taken  greatest precautions  my mind should  impressed  no supernatural horrors i do not ever remember  have trembled   tale  superstition or  have feared  apparition   spirit darkness had no effect upon my fancy   churchyard   me merely  receptacle  bodies deprived  life which  being  seat  beauty  strength had become food   worm now i  led  examine  cause  progress  this decay  forced  spend days  nights  vaults  charnelhouses my attention  fixed upon

wondrous yet so simple  while i became dizzy   immensity   prospect which  illustrated i  surprised  among so many men  genius who had directed their inquiries towards  same science  i alone should  reserved  discover so astonishing  secret remember i am not recording  vision   madman the sun does not more certainly shine   heavens than  which i now affirm  true some miracle might have produced it yet  stages   discovery  distinct  probable after days  nights  incredible labour  fatigue i succeeded  discovering  cause  generation  life nay more i became myself capable  bestowing animation

most gratifying consummation  my toils but this discovery  so great  overwhelming  all  steps  which i had been progressively led    obliterated  i beheld only  result what had been  study  desire   wisest men since  creation   world  now within my grasp not that like  magic scene  all opened upon me  once  information i had obtained    nature rather  direct my endeavours so soon  i should point them towards  object  my search than  exhibit  object already accomplished i  like  arabian who had been buried   dead  found  passage  life aided only  one glimmering  seemingly ineffectual light i see  your eagerness   wonder  hope which your eyes express my friend  you expect   informed   secret  which i am acquainted  cannot be listen patiently until  end  my story  you  easily perceive why i

how much happier  man  who believes his native town    world than  who aspires  become greater than his nature  allow when i found so astonishing  power placed within my hands i hesitated  long time concerning  manner  which i should employ it although i possessed  capacity  bestowing animation yet  prepare  frame   reception  it  all  intricacies  fibres muscles  veins still remained  work  inconceivable difficulty  labour i doubted  first whether i should attempt  creation   being like myself or one  simpler organization but my imagination  too much exalted  my first success  permit me  doubt  my ability  give life   animal  complex  wonderful  man the materials  present within my command hardly appeared adequate  so arduous  undertaking but i doubted not  i should ultimately succeed i prepared myself   multitude  reverses my operations might  incessantly baffled   last my work  imperfect yet when i considered  improvement which every day takes place  science  mechanics i  encouraged  hope my present attempts would  least lay  foundations  future success nor could i consider  magnitude  complexity  my plan  any argument   impracticability it   these feelings  i began  creation   human being as  minuteness   parts formed  great hindrance  my speed i resolved contrary  my first intention  make  being   gigantic stature    say about eight feet  height  proportionably large after having formed this determination  having spent some months  successfully collecting  arranging my materials i began no one can conceive  variety  feelings which bore me onwards like  hurricane   first enthusiasm  success life  death appeared  me ideal bounds which i should first break through  pour  torrent  light into our dark world a new species would bless me   creator  source many happy  excellent natures would owe their being  me no father could claim  gratitude  his child so completely  i should deserve theirs pursuing these reflections i thought  if i could bestow animation upon lifeless matter i might  process  time although i now found  impossible renew life where death had apparently devoted  body  corruption these thoughts supported my spirits while i pursued my undertaking  unremitting ardour my cheek had grown pale  study  my person had become emaciated  confinement sometimes   very brink  certainty i failed yet still i clung   hope which  next day or  next hour might realise one secret which i alone possessed   hope  which i had dedicated myself   moon gazed  my midnight labours while  unrelaxed  breathless eagerness i pursued nature  her hidingplaces who shall conceive  horrors  my secret toil  i dabbled among  unhallowed damps   grave or tortured  living animal  animate  lifeless clay my limbs now tremble  my eyes swim   remembrance but then  resistless  almost frantic impulse urged me forward i seemed  have lost all soul or sensation but  this one pursuit it  indeed but  passing trance  only made me feel  renewed acuteness so soon as  unnatural stimulus ceasing  operate i had returned  my old habits i collected bones  charnelhouses  disturbed  profane fingers  tremendous secrets   human frame in  solitary chamber or rather cell   top   house  separated  all  other apartments   gallery  staircase i kept my workshop  filthy creation my eyeballs  starting  their sockets  attending   details  my employment the dissecting room   slaughterhouse furnished many  my materials  often did my human nature turn  loathing  my occupation whilst still urged    eagerness which perpetually increased i brought my work near   conclusion the summer months passed while i  thus engaged heart  soul  one pursuit it   most beautiful season never did  fields bestow  more plentiful harvest or  vines yield  more luxuriant vintage but my eyes  insensible   charms  nature and  same feelings which made me neglect  scenes around me caused me also  forget those friends who  so many miles absent  whom i had not seen  so long  time i knew my silence disquieted them  i well remembered  words  my father “i know  while you  pleased  yourself you  think  us  affection  we shall hear regularly  you you must pardon me if i regard any interruption  your correspondence   proof  your other duties  equally neglected” i knew well therefore what would  my father’s feelings but i could not tear my thoughts  my employment loathsome  itself but which had taken  irresistible hold  my imagination i wished   were  procrastinate all  related  my feelings  affection until  great object which swallowed up every habit  my nature should  completed i then thought  my father would  unjust if  ascribed my neglect  vice or faultiness  my part but i am now convinced    justified  conceiving  i should not  altogether free  blame a human being  perfection ought always  preserve  calm  peaceful mind  never  allow passion or  transitory desire  disturb his tranquillity i do not think   pursuit  knowledge   exception  this rule if  study

would have been discovered more gradually   empires  mexico  peru had not been destroyed but i forget  i am moralizing   most interesting part  my tale  your looks remind me  proceed my father made no reproach  his letters  only took notice  my silence  inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before winter spring  summer passed away during my labours but i did not watch  blossom or

infinite pains  care i had endeavoured  form his limbs   proportion  i had selected his features  beautiful beautiful great god his yellow skin scarcely covered  work  muscles  arteries beneath his

his shrivelled complexion  straight black lips the different accidents  life  not so changeable   feelings  human nature i had worked hard  nearly two years   sole purpose  infusing life into  inanimate body for this i had deprived myself  rest  health i had desired    ardour  far exceeded moderation but now  i had finished  beauty   dream vanished  breathless horror  disgust filled my heart unable  endure  aspect   being i had created i rushed out   room  continued  long time traversing my bedchamber unable  compose my mind  sleep at length lassitude succeeded   tumult i had before endured  i threw myself   bed  my clothes endeavouring  seek  few moments  forgetfulness but    vain i slept indeed but i  disturbed   wildest dreams i thought i saw elizabeth   bloom  health walking   streets  ingolstadt delighted  surprised i embraced her but  i imprinted  first kiss  her lips they became livid   hue  death her features appeared  change  i thought  i held  corpse  my dead mother  my arms  shroud enveloped her form  i saw  graveworms crawling   folds   flannel i started  my sleep  horror  cold dew covered my forehead my teeth chattered  every limb became convulsed when   dim  yellow light   moon   forced  way through  window shutters i beheld  wretch—the miserable monster whom i had created he held up  curtain   bed  his eyes if eyes they may  called  fixed  me his jaws opened   muttered some inarticulate sounds while  grin wrinkled his cheeks he might have spoken but i did not hear one hand  stretched out seemingly  detain me but i escaped  rushed downstairs i took refuge   courtyard belonging   house which i inhabited where i remained during  rest   night walking up  down   greatest agitation listening attentively catching  fearing each sound  if    announce  approach   demoniacal corpse  which i had so miserably given life oh no mortal could support  horror   countenance a mummy again endued  animation could not  so hideous   wretch i had gazed  him while unfinished   ugly then but when those muscles  joints  rendered capable  motion  became  thing such  even dante could not have conceived i passed  night wretchedly sometimes my pulse beat so quickly  hardly  i felt  palpitation  every artery  others i nearly sank   ground through languor  extreme weakness mingled  this horror i felt  bitterness  disappointment dreams  had been my food  pleasant rest  so long  space  now become  hell  me   change  so rapid  overthrow so complete morning dismal  wet  length dawned  discovered  my sleepless  aching eyes  church  ingolstadt  white steeple  clock which indicated  sixth hour the porter opened  gates   court which had  night been my asylum  i issued into  streets pacing them  quick steps  if i sought  avoid  wretch whom i feared every turning   street would present  my view i did not dare return   apartment which i inhabited but felt impelled  hurry on although drenched   rain which poured   black  comfortless sky i continued walking  this manner  some time endeavouring  bodily exercise  ease  load  weighed upon my mind i traversed  streets without any clear conception  where i  or what i  doing my heart palpitated   sickness  fear  i hurried   irregular steps not daring  look about me like one who   lonely road doth walk  fear  dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because  knows  frightful fiend doth close behind him tread coleridge’s “ancient mariner” continuing thus i came  length opposite   inn  which  various diligences  carriages usually stopped here i paused i knew not why but i remained some minutes  my eyes fixed   coach   coming towards me   other end   street as  drew nearer i observed     swiss diligence  stopped just where i  standing    door being opened i perceived henry clerval who  seeing me instantly sprung out “my dear frankenstein” exclaimed he “how glad i am  see you how fortunate  you should  here   very moment  my alighting” nothing could equal my delight  seeing clerval his presence brought back  my thoughts my father elizabeth  all those scenes  home so dear  my recollection i grasped his hand    moment forgot my horror  misfortune i felt suddenly    first time during many months calm  serene joy i welcomed my friend therefore   most cordial manner  we walked towards my college clerval continued talking  some time about our mutual friends  his own good fortune  being permitted  come  ingolstadt “you may easily believe” said he “how great   difficulty  persuade my father  all necessary knowledge  not comprised   noble art  bookkeeping and indeed i believe i left him incredulous   last  his constant answer  my unwearied entreaties   same     dutch schoolmaster  the vicar  wakefield ‘i have ten thousand florins  year without greek i eat heartily without greek’ but his affection  me  length overcame his dislike  learning    permitted me  undertake  voyage  discovery   land  knowledge” “it gives me  greatest delight  see you but tell me how you left my father brothers  elizabeth” “very well  very happy only  little uneasy  they hear  you so seldom by  by i mean  lecture you  little upon their account myself but my dear frankenstein” continued he stopping short  gazing full  my face “i did not before remark how very ill you appear so thin  pale you look  if you had been watching  several nights” “you have guessed right i have lately been so deeply engaged  one occupation  i have not allowed myself sufficient rest  you see but i hope i sincerely hope  all these employments  now   end   i am  length free” i trembled excessively i could not endure  think of  far less  allude to  occurrences   preceding night i walked   quick pace  we soon arrived  my college i then reflected   thought made me shiver   creature whom i had left  my apartment might still  there alive  walking about i dreaded  behold this monster but i feared still more  henry should see him entreating him therefore  remain  few minutes   bottom   stairs i darted up towards my own room my hand  already   lock   door before i recollected myself i then paused   cold shivering came over me i threw  door forcibly open  children  accustomed  do when they expect  spectre  stand  waiting  them   other side but nothing appeared i stepped fearfully in  apartment  empty  my bedroom  also freed   hideous guest i could hardly believe  so great  good fortune could have befallen me but when i became assured  my enemy had indeed fled i clapped my hands  joy  ran down  clerval we ascended into my room   servant presently brought breakfast but i  unable  contain myself it  not joy only  possessed me i felt my flesh tingle  excess  sensitiveness  my pulse beat rapidly i  unable  remain   single instant   same place i jumped over  chairs clapped my hands  laughed aloud clerval  first attributed my unusual spirits  joy  his arrival but when  observed me more attentively  saw  wildness  my eyes  which  could not account  my loud unrestrained heartless laughter frightened  astonished him “my dear victor” cried he “what  god’s sake   matter do not laugh   manner how ill you are what   cause  all this” “do not ask me” cried i putting my hands before my eyes  i thought i saw  dreaded spectre glide into  room “he can tell oh save me save me” i imagined   monster seized me i struggled furiously  fell down   fit poor clerval what must have been his feelings a meeting which  anticipated  such joy so strangely turned  bitterness but i  not  witness  his grief  i  lifeless  did not recover my senses   long long time this   commencement   nervous fever which confined me  several months during all  time henry  my only nurse i afterwards learned that knowing my father’s advanced age  unfitness  so long  journey  how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth  spared them this grief  concealing  extent  my disorder he knew  i could not have  more kind  attentive nurse than himself and firm   hope  felt  my recovery  did not doubt that instead  doing harm  performed  kindest action   could towards them but i   reality very ill  surely nothing but  unbounded  unremitting attentions  my friend could have restored me  life the form   monster  whom i had bestowed existence   ever before my eyes  i raved incessantly concerning him doubtless my words surprised henry   first believed them    wanderings  my disturbed imagination but  pertinacity  which i continually recurred   same subject persuaded him  my disorder indeed owed  origin  some uncommon  terrible event by very slow degrees   frequent relapses  alarmed  grieved my friend i recovered i remember  first time i became capable  observing outward objects  any kind  pleasure i perceived   fallen leaves had disappeared    young buds  shooting forth   trees  shaded my window it   divine spring   season contributed greatly  my convalescence i felt also sentiments  joy  affection revive  my bosom my gloom disappeared    short time i became  cheerful  before i  attacked   fatal passion “dearest clerval” exclaimed i “how kind how very good you   me this whole winter instead  being spent  study  you promised yourself  been consumed  my sick room how shall i ever repay you i feel  greatest remorse   disappointment  which i have been  occasion but you  forgive me” “you  repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself but get well  fast  you can  since you appear  such good spirits i may speak  you  one subject may i not” i trembled one subject what could  be could  allude   object  whom i dared not even think “compose yourself” said clerval who observed my change  colour “i  not mention  if  agitates you but your father  cousin would  very happy if they received  letter  you  your own handwriting they hardly know how ill you have been   uneasy  your long silence” “is  all my dear henry how could you suppose  my first thought would not fly towards those dear dear friends whom i love  who  so deserving  my love” “if this  your present temper my friend you  perhaps  glad  see  letter   been lying here some days  you    your cousin i believe” chapter  clerval then put  following letter into my hands it   my own elizabeth “my dearest cousin “you have been ill very ill  even  constant letters  dear kind henry  not sufficient  reassure me  your account you  forbidden  write—to hold  pen yet

now done nearly   light  my own vampire my own spirit let loose   grave  forced  destroy all   dear  me day dawned  i directed my steps towards  town the gates  open  i hastened  my father’s house my first thought   discover what i knew   murderer  cause instant pursuit   made but i paused when i reflected   story  i had  tell a being whom i myself had formed  endued  life had met me  midnight among  precipices   inaccessible mountain i remembered also  nervous fever  which i had been seized just   time  i dated my creation  which would give  air  delirium   tale otherwise so utterly improbable i well knew  if any other had communicated such  relation  me i should have looked upon    ravings  insanity besides  strange nature   animal would elude all pursuit even if i  so far credited   persuade my relatives  commence it and then  what use would  pursuit who could arrest  creature capable  scaling  overhanging sides  mont salêve these reflections determined me  i resolved  remain silent it  about five   morning when i entered my father’s house i told  servants not  disturb  family  went into  library  attend their usual hour  rising six years had elapsed passed   dream but  one indelible trace  i stood   same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure  ingolstadt beloved  venerable parent he still remained  me i gazed   picture  my mother which stood over  mantelpiece it   historical subject painted  my father’s desire  represented caroline beaufort   agony  despair kneeling   coffin  her dead father her garb  rustic  her cheek pale but there   air  dignity  beauty  hardly permitted  sentiment  pity below this picture   miniature  william  my tears flowed when i looked upon it while i  thus engaged ernest entered  had heard me arrive  hastened  welcome me “welcome my dearest victor” said he “ah i wish you had come three months ago  then you would have found us all joyous  delighted you come  us now  share  misery which nothing can alleviate yet your presence will i hope revive our father who seems sinking under his misfortune  your persuasions  induce poor elizabeth  cease her vain  tormenting selfaccusations—poor william   our darling  our pride” tears unrestrained fell  my brother’s eyes  sense  mortal agony crept over my frame before i had only imagined  wretchedness  my desolated home  reality came  me   new   not less terrible disaster i tried  calm ernest i enquired more minutely concerning my father  here i named my cousin “she most  all” said ernest “requires consolation she accused herself  having caused  death  my brother   made her very wretched but since  murderer  been discovered—” “the murderer discovered good god how can  be who could attempt  pursue him it  impossible one might  well try  overtake  winds or confine  mountainstream   straw i saw him too   free last night” “i do not know what you mean” replied my brother  accents  wonder “but  us  discovery we have made completes our misery no one would believe   first  even now elizabeth  not  convinced notwithstanding all  evidence indeed who would credit  justine moritz who  so amiable  fond  all  family could suddenly become so capable  so frightful so appalling  crime” “justine moritz poor poor girl  she  accused but   wrongfully every one knows that no one believes it surely ernest” “no one did  first but several circumstances came out  have almost forced conviction upon us  her own behaviour  been so confused   add   evidence  facts  weight that i fear leaves no hope  doubt but she   tried today  you  then hear all” he then related that  morning  which  murder  poor william had been discovered justine had been taken ill  confined  her bed  several days during this interval one   servants happening  examine  apparel she had worn   night   murder had discovered  her pocket  picture  my mother which had been judged    temptation   murderer the servant instantly showed   one   others who without saying  word  any   family went   magistrate and upon their deposition justine  apprehended on being charged   fact  poor girl confirmed  suspicion   great measure  her extreme confusion  manner this   strange tale but  did not shake my faith  i replied earnestly “you  all mistaken i know  murderer justine poor good justine  innocent” at  instant my father entered i saw unhappiness deeply impressed  his countenance but  endeavoured  welcome me cheerfully and after we had exchanged our mournful greeting would have introduced some other topic than   our disaster had not ernest exclaimed “good god papa victor says   knows who   murderer  poor william” “we do also unfortunately” replied my father “for indeed i had rather have been  ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity  ungratitude  one i valued so highly” “my dear father you  mistaken justine  innocent” “if she is god forbid  she should suffer  guilty she    tried today  i hope i sincerely hope  she   acquitted” this speech calmed me i  firmly convinced  my own mind  justine  indeed every human being  guiltless  this murder i had no fear therefore  any circumstantial evidence could  brought forward strong enough  convict her my tale  not one  announce publicly  astounding horror would  looked upon  madness   vulgar did any one indeed exist except i  creator who would believe unless his senses convinced him   existence   living monument  presumption  rash ignorance which i had let loose upon  world we  soon joined  elizabeth time had altered her since i last beheld her  had endowed her  loveliness surpassing  beauty  her childish years there   same candour  same vivacity but   allied   expression more full  sensibility  intellect she welcomed me   greatest affection “your arrival my dear cousin” said she “fills me  hope you perhaps  find some means  justify my poor guiltless justine alas who  safe if she  convicted  crime i rely  her innocence  certainly  i do upon my own our misfortune  doubly hard  us we have not only lost  lovely darling boy but this poor girl whom i sincerely love    torn away  even  worse fate if she  condemned i never shall know joy more but she  not i am sure she  not  then i shall  happy again even after  sad death  my little william” “she  innocent my elizabeth” said i “and  shall  proved fear nothing but let your spirits  cheered   assurance  her acquittal” “how kind  generous you are every one else believes  her guilt   made me wretched  i knew    impossible   see every one else prejudiced  so deadly  manner rendered me hopeless  despairing” she wept “dearest niece” said my father “dry your tears if she is  you believe innocent rely   justice  our laws   activity  which i shall prevent  slightest shadow  partiality” chapter  we passed  few sad hours until eleven o’clock when  trial   commence my father   rest   family being obliged  attend  witnesses i accompanied them   court during  whole  this wretched mockery  justice i suffered living torture it    decided whether  result  my curiosity  lawless devices would cause  death  two  my fellow beings one  smiling babe full  innocence  joy  other far more dreadfully murdered  every aggravation  infamy

suffered through me the appearance  justine  calm she  dressed  mourning  her countenance always engaging  rendered   solemnity  her feelings exquisitely beautiful yet she appeared confident  innocence  did not tremble although gazed   execrated  thousands  all  kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited  obliterated   minds   spectators   imagination   enormity she  supposed  have committed she  tranquil yet her tranquillity  evidently constrained   her confusion had before been adduced   proof  her guilt she worked up her mind   appearance  courage when she entered  court she threw her eyes round   quickly discovered where we  seated a tear seemed  dim her eye when she saw us but she quickly recovered herself   look  sorrowful affection seemed  attest her utter guiltlessness the trial began  after  advocate against her had stated  charge several witnesses  called several strange facts combined against her which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof  her innocence  i had she had been out  whole   night  which  murder had been committed  towards morning had been perceived   marketwoman not far   spot where  body   murdered child had been afterwards found the woman asked her what she did there but she looked very strangely  only returned  confused  unintelligible answer she returned   house about eight o’clock  when one inquired where she had passed  night she replied  she had been looking   child  demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him when shown  body she fell into violent hysterics  kept her bed  several days the picture  then produced which  servant had found  her pocket  when elizabeth   faltering voice proved     same which  hour before  child had been missed she had placed round his neck  murmur  horror  indignation filled  court justine  called   her defence as  trial had proceeded her countenance had altered surprise horror  misery  strongly expressed sometimes she struggled  her tears but when she  desired  plead she collected her powers  spoke   audible although variable voice “god knows” she said “how entirely i am innocent but i do not pretend  my protestations should acquit me i rest my innocence   plain  simple explanation   facts which have been adduced against me  i hope  character i have always borne  incline my judges   favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious” she then related that   permission  elizabeth she had passed  evening   night  which  murder had been committed   house   aunt  chêne  village situated  about  league  geneva on her return  about nine o’clock she met  man who asked her if she had seen anything   child who  lost she  alarmed  this account  passed several hours  looking  him when  gates  geneva  shut  she  forced  remain several hours   night   barn belonging   cottage being unwilling  call up  inhabitants  whom she  well known most   night she spent here watching towards morning she believed  she slept   few minutes some steps disturbed her  she awoke it  dawn  she quitted her asylum  she might again endeavour  find my brother if she had gone near  spot where his body lay   without her knowledge that she had been bewildered when questioned   marketwoman  not surprising since she had passed  sleepless night   fate  poor william  yet uncertain concerning  picture she could give no account “i know” continued  unhappy victim “how heavily  fatally this one circumstance weighs against me but i have no power  explaining it  when i have expressed my utter ignorance i am only left  conjecture concerning  probabilities  which  might have been placed  my pocket but here also i am checked i believe  i have no enemy  earth  none surely would have been so wicked   destroy me wantonly did  murderer place  there i know  no opportunity afforded him  so doing or if i had why should  have stolen  jewel  part   again so soon “i commit my cause   justice  my judges yet i see no room  hope i beg permission  have  few witnesses examined concerning my character  if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt i must  condemned although i would pledge my salvation  my innocence” several witnesses  called who had known her  many years  they spoke well  her but fear  hatred   crime  which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous  unwilling  come forward elizabeth saw even this last resource her excellent dispositions  irreproachable conduct about  fail  accused when although violently agitated she desired permission  address  court “i am” said she “the cousin   unhappy child who  murdered or rather his sister  i  educated   have lived  his parents ever since  even long before his birth it may therefore  judged indecent  me  come forward  this occasion but when i see  fellow creature about  perish through  cowardice  her pretended friends i wish   allowed  speak  i may say what i know  her character i am well acquainted   accused i have lived   same house  her  one time  five   another  nearly two years during all  period she appeared  me  most amiable  benevolent  human creatures she nursed madame frankenstein my aunt  her last illness   greatest affection  care  afterwards attended her own mother during  tedious illness   manner  excited  admiration  all who knew her after which she again lived  my uncle’s house where she  beloved  all  family she  warmly attached   child who  now dead  acted towards him like  most affectionate mother for my own part i do not hesitate  say that notwithstanding all  evidence produced against her i believe  rely  her perfect innocence she had no temptation  such  action    bauble  which  chief proof rests if she had earnestly desired it i should have willingly given   her so much do i esteem  value her” a murmur  approbation followed elizabeth’s simple  powerful appeal but   excited  her generous interference  not  favour  poor justine  whom  public indignation  turned  renewed violence charging her   blackest ingratitude she herself wept  elizabeth spoke but she did not answer my own agitation  anguish  extreme during  whole trial i believed  her innocence i knew it could  dæmon who had i did not   minute doubt murdered my brother also  his hellish sport have betrayed  innocent  death  ignominy i could not sustain  horror  my situation  when i perceived   popular voice   countenances   judges had already condemned my unhappy victim i rushed out   court  agony the tortures   accused did not equal mine she  sustained  innocence but  fangs  remorse tore my bosom  would not forgo their hold i passed  night  unmingled wretchedness in  morning i went   court my lips  throat  parched i dared not ask  fatal question but i  known   officer guessed  cause  my visit the ballots had been thrown they  all black  justine  condemned i cannot pretend  describe what i then felt i had before experienced sensations  horror  i have endeavoured  bestow upon them adequate expressions but words cannot convey  idea   heartsickening despair  i then endured the person  whom i addressed myself added  justine had already confessed her guilt “that evidence”  observed “was hardly required  so glaring  case but i am glad  it and indeed none  our judges like  condemn  criminal upon circumstantial evidence   ever so decisive” this  strange  unexpected intelligence what could  mean had my eyes deceived me and  i really  mad   whole world would believe me   if i disclosed  object  my suspicions i hastened  return home  elizabeth eagerly demanded  result “my cousin” replied i “it  decided  you may have expected all judges had rather  ten innocent should suffer than  one guilty should escape but she  confessed” this   dire blow  poor elizabeth who had relied  firmness upon justine’s innocence “alas” said she “how shall i ever again believe  human goodness justine whom i loved  esteemed  my sister how could she put  those smiles  innocence only  betray her mild eyes seemed incapable  any severity or guile  yet she  committed  murder” soon after we heard   poor victim had expressed  desire  see my cousin my father wished her not  go but said   left   her own judgment  feelings  decide “yes” said elizabeth “i  go although she  guilty  you victor shall accompany me i cannot go alone” the idea  this visit  torture  me yet i could not refuse we entered  gloomy prison chamber  beheld justine sitting  some straw   farther end her hands  manacled  her head rested  her knees she rose  seeing us enter  when we  left alone  her she threw herself   feet  elizabeth weeping bitterly my cousin wept also “oh justine” said she “why did you rob me  my last consolation i relied  your innocence  although i  then very wretched i  not so miserable  i am now” “and do you also believe  i am so very very wicked do you also join  my enemies  crush me  condemn me   murderer” her voice  suffocated  sobs “rise my poor girl” said elizabeth “why do you kneel if you  innocent i am not one  your enemies i believed you guiltless notwithstanding every evidence until i heard  you had yourself declared your guilt that report you say  false   assured dear justine  nothing can shake my confidence  you   moment but your own confession” “i did confess but i confessed  lie i confessed  i might obtain absolution but now  falsehood lies heavier  my heart than all my other sins the god  heaven forgive me ever since i  condemned my confessor  besieged me  threatened  menaced until i almost began  think  i   monster   said i was he threatened excommunication  hell fire  my last moments if i continued obdurate dear lady i had none  support me all looked  me   wretch doomed  ignominy  perdition what could i do in  evil hour i subscribed   lie  now only am i truly miserable” she paused weeping  then continued “i thought  horror my sweet lady  you should believe your justine whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured  whom you loved   creature capable   crime which none but  devil himself could have perpetrated dear william dearest blessed child i soon shall see you again  heaven where we shall all  happy   consoles me going  i am  suffer ignominy  death” “oh justine forgive me  having  one moment distrusted you why did you confess but do not mourn dear girl do not fear i  proclaim i  prove your innocence i  melt  stony hearts  your enemies  my tears  prayers you shall not die you my playfellow my companion my sister perish   scaffold no no i never could survive so horrible  misfortune” justine shook her head mournfully “i do not fear  die” she said “that pang  past god raises my weakness  gives me courage  endure  worst i leave  sad  bitter world  if you remember me  think  me   one unjustly condemned i am resigned   fate awaiting me learn  me dear lady  submit  patience     heaven” during this conversation i had retired   corner   prison room where i could conceal  horrid anguish  possessed me despair who dared talk  that the poor victim who   morrow   pass  awful boundary between life  death felt not  i did such deep  bitter agony i gnashed my teeth  ground them together uttering  groan  came  my inmost soul justine started when she saw who  was she approached me  said “dear sir you  very kind  visit me you i hope do not believe  i am guilty” i could not answer “no justine” said elizabeth “he  more convinced  your innocence than i was  even when  heard  you had confessed  did not credit it” “i truly thank him in these last moments i feel  sincerest gratitude towards those who think  me  kindness how sweet   affection  others  such  wretch  i am it removes more than half my misfortune  i feel  if i could die  peace now  my innocence  acknowledged  you dear lady  your cousin” thus  poor sufferer tried  comfort others  herself she indeed gained  resignation she desired but i  true murderer felt  neverdying worm alive  my bosom which allowed  no hope or consolation elizabeth also wept   unhappy but hers also   misery  innocence which like  cloud  passes over  fair moon   while hides but cannot tarnish  brightness anguish  despair had penetrated into  core  my heart i bore  hell within me which nothing could extinguish we stayed several hours  justine     great difficulty  elizabeth could tear herself away “i wish” cried she “that i   die  you i cannot live  this world  misery” justine assumed  air  cheerfulness while she  difficulty repressed her bitter tears she embraced elizabeth  said   voice  halfsuppressed emotion “farewell sweet lady dearest elizabeth my beloved  only friend may heaven   bounty bless  preserve you may this   last misfortune  you  ever suffer live   happy  make others so” and   morrow justine died elizabeth’s heartrending eloquence failed  move  judges  their settled conviction   criminality   saintly sufferer my passionate  indignant appeals  lost upon them and when i received their cold answers  heard  harsh unfeeling reasoning  these men my purposed avowal died away  my lips thus i might proclaim myself  madman but not revoke  sentence passed upon my wretched victim she perished   scaffold   murderess from  tortures  my own heart i

unearthly ugliness rendered  almost too horrible  human eyes but i scarcely observed this rage  hatred had  first deprived me  utterance  i recovered only  overwhelm him  words expressive  furious

my eyes  i now suppose  light poured  upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found  great alteration  my sensations before dark  opaque bodies had surrounded me impervious  my touch or sight but i now found  i could wander   liberty  no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid the light became more  more oppressive  me   heat wearying me  i walked i sought  place where i could receive shade this   forest near ingolstadt  here i lay   side   brook resting  my fatigue until i felt tormented  hunger  thirst this roused me  my nearly dormant state  i ate

among  trees the moon i gazed   kind  wonder it moved slowly but  enlightened my path  i again went out  search  berries i  still cold when under one   trees i found  huge cloak  which i covered myself  sat down upon  ground no distinct ideas occupied my mind all  confused i felt light  hunger  thirst  darkness innumerable sounds rang  my ears   all sides various scents saluted me  only object  i could distinguish   bright moon  i fixed my eyes    pleasure “several changes  day  night passed   orb  night had greatly lessened when i began  distinguish my sensations  each other i gradually saw plainly  clear stream  supplied me  drink   trees  shaded me  their foliage i  delighted when i first discovered   pleasant sound which often saluted my ears proceeded   throats   little

but quickly drew  out again   cry  pain how strange i thought   same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined  materials   fire   my joy found    composed  wood i quickly collected some branches but they  wet  would not burn i  pained  this  sat still watching  operation   fire the wet wood which i had placed near  heat dried  itself became inflamed i reflected  this   touching  various branches i discovered  cause  busied myself  collecting  great quantity  wood  i might dry   have  plentiful supply  fire when night came   brought sleep  it i    greatest fear lest my fire should  extinguished i covered  carefully  dry wood  leaves  placed wet branches upon it  then spreading my cloak i lay   ground  sank into sleep “it  morning when i awoke  my first care   visit  fire i uncovered it   gentle breeze quickly fanned  into  flame i observed this also  contrived  fan  branches which roused  embers when they  nearly extinguished when night came again i found  pleasure   fire gave light  well  heat    discovery  this element  useful  me  my food  i found some   offals   travellers had left had been roasted  tasted much more savoury than  berries i gathered   trees i tried therefore  dress my food   same manner placing    live embers i found   berries  spoiled  this operation   nuts  roots much improved “food however became scarce  i often spent  whole day searching  vain   few acorns  assuage  pangs  hunger when i found this i resolved  quit  place  i had hitherto inhabited  seek  one where  few wants i experienced would  more easily satisfied in this emigration i exceedingly lamented  loss   fire which i had obtained through accident  knew not how  reproduce it i gave several hours   serious consideration  this difficulty but i  obliged  relinquish all attempt  supply it  wrapping myself up  my cloak i struck across  wood towards  setting sun i passed three days  these rambles   length discovered  open country a great fall  snow had taken place  night before   fields   one uniform white  appearance  disconsolate  i found my feet chilled   cold damp substance  covered  ground “it  about seven   morning  i longed  obtain food  shelter  length i perceived  small hut   rising ground which had doubtless been built   convenience  some shepherd this   new sight  me  i examined  structure  great curiosity finding  door open i entered an old man sat  it near  fire over which   preparing his breakfast he turned  hearing  noise  perceiving me shrieked loudly  quitting  hut ran across  fields   speed  which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable his appearance different  any i had ever before seen  his flight somewhat surprised me but i  enchanted   appearance   hut here  snow  rain could not penetrate  ground

bread cheese milk  wine  latter however i did not like then overcome  fatigue i lay down among some straw  fell asleep “it  noon when i awoke  allured   warmth   sun which shone brightly   white ground i determined  recommence my travels and depositing  remains   peasant’s breakfast   wallet i found i proceeded across  fields  several hours until  sunset i arrived   village how miraculous did this appear the huts  neater cottages  stately houses engaged my admiration  turns the vegetables   gardens  milk  cheese  i saw placed   windows  some   cottages allured my appetite one   best  these i entered but i had hardly placed my foot within  door before  children shrieked  one   women fainted the whole village  roused some fled some attacked me until grievously bruised  stones  many other kinds  missile weapons i escaped   open country  fearfully took refuge   low hovel quite bare  making  wretched appearance after  palaces i had beheld   village this hovel however joined  cottage   neat  pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it my place  refuge  constructed  wood but so low  i could  difficulty sit upright  it no wood however  placed   earth which formed  floor but   dry  although  wind entered   innumerable chinks i found   agreeable asylum   snow  rain “here then i retreated  lay down happy  have found  shelter however miserable   inclemency   season  still more   barbarity  man as soon  morning dawned i crept  my kennel  i might view  adjacent cottage  discover if i could remain   habitation i had found it  situated against  back   cottage  surrounded   sides which  exposed   pig sty   clear pool  water one part  open    i had crept in but now i covered every crevice  which i might  perceived  stones  wood yet  such  manner  i might move them  occasion  pass out all  light i enjoyed came through  sty    sufficient  me “having thus arranged my dwelling  carpeted   clean straw i retired  i saw  figure   man   distance  i remembered too well my treatment  night before  trust myself  his power i had first however provided  my sustenance   day   loaf  coarse bread which i purloined   cup  which i could drink more conveniently than  my hand   pure water which flowed  my retreat the floor   little raised so    kept perfectly dry    vicinity   chimney   cottage   tolerably warm “being thus provided i resolved  reside  this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination it  indeed  paradise compared   bleak forest my former residence  raindropping branches  dank earth i ate my breakfast  pleasure   about  remove  plank  procure myself  little water when i heard  step  looking through  small chink i beheld  young creature   pail  her head passing before my hovel the girl  young   gentle demeanour unlike what i have since found cottagers  farmhouse servants  be yet she  meanly dressed  coarse blue petticoat   linen jacket being her only garb her fair hair  plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad i lost sight  her   about  quarter   hour she returned bearing  pail which  now partly filled  milk as she walked along seemingly incommoded   burden  young man met her whose countenance expressed  deeper despondence uttering  few sounds   air  melancholy  took  pail  her head  bore    cottage himself she followed  they disappeared presently i saw  young man again  some tools  his hand cross  field behind  cottage   girl  also busied sometimes   house  sometimes   yard “on examining my dwelling i found  one   windows   cottage had formerly occupied  part  it but  panes had been filled up  wood in one  these   small  almost imperceptible chink through which  eye could just penetrate through this crevice  small room  visible whitewashed  clean but very bare  furniture in one corner near  small fire sat  old man leaning his head  his hands   disconsolate attitude the young girl  occupied  arranging  cottage but presently she took something out   drawer which employed her hands  she sat down beside  old man who taking up  instrument began  play   produce sounds sweeter than  voice   thrush or  nightingale it   lovely sight even  me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before the silver hair  benevolent countenance   aged cottager won my reverence while  gentle manners   girl enticed my love he played  sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears   eyes  his amiable companion  which  old man took no notice until she sobbed audibly  then pronounced  few sounds   fair creature leaving her work knelt  his feet he raised her  smiled  such kindness  affection  i felt sensations   peculiar  overpowering nature they   mixture  pain  pleasure such  i had never before experienced either  hunger or cold warmth or food  i withdrew   window unable  bear these emotions “soon after this  young man returned bearing  his shoulders  load  wood the girl met him   door helped  relieve him  his burden  taking some   fuel into  cottage placed    fire then she   youth went apart into  nook   cottage   showed her  large loaf   piece  cheese she seemed pleased  went into  garden  some roots  plants which she placed  water  then upon  fire she afterwards continued her work whilst  young man went into  garden  appeared busily employed  digging  pulling up roots after  had been employed thus about  hour  young woman joined him  they entered  cottage together “the old man had   meantime been pensive but   appearance  his companions  assumed  more cheerful air  they sat down  eat the meal  quickly dispatched the young woman  again occupied  arranging  cottage  old man walked before  cottage   sun   few minutes leaning   arm   youth nothing could exceed  beauty  contrast between these two excellent creatures one  old  silver hairs   countenance beaming  benevolence  love  younger  slight  graceful  his figure  his features  moulded   finest symmetry yet his eyes  attitude expressed  utmost sadness  despondency the old man returned   cottage   youth  tools different  those  had used   morning directed his steps across  fields “night quickly shut in but  my extreme wonder i found   cottagers had  means  prolonging light   use  tapers   delighted  find   setting   sun did not put  end   pleasure i experienced  watching my human neighbours in  evening  young girl  her companion  employed  various occupations which i did not understand   old man again took up  instrument which produced  divine sounds  had enchanted me   morning so soon   had finished  youth began not  play but  utter sounds   monotonous  neither resembling  harmony   old man’s instrument nor  songs   birds i since found   read aloud but   time i knew nothing   science  words or letters “the family after having been thus occupied   short time extinguished their lights  retired  i conjectured  rest” chapter  “i lay  my straw but i could not sleep i thought   occurrences   day what chiefly struck me   gentle manners  these people  i longed  join them but dared not i remembered too well  treatment i had suffered  night before   barbarous villagers  resolved whatever course  conduct i might hereafter think  right  pursue    present i would remain quietly  my hovel watching  endeavouring  discover  motives which influenced their actions “the cottagers arose  next morning before  sun the young woman arranged  cottage  prepared  food   youth departed after  first meal “this day  passed   same routine   which preceded it the young man  constantly employed out  doors   girl  various laborious occupations within the old man whom i soon perceived   blind employed his leisure hours  his instrument or  contemplation nothing could exceed  love  respect which  younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion they performed towards him every little office  affection  duty  gentleness   rewarded them  his benevolent smiles “they  not entirely happy the young man  his companion often went apart  appeared  weep i saw no cause  their unhappiness but i  deeply affected  it if such lovely creatures  miserable   less strange  i  imperfect  solitary being should  wretched yet why  these gentle beings unhappy they possessed  delightful house for such    my eyes  every luxury they had  fire  warm them when chill  delicious viands when hungry they  dressed  excellent clothes and still more they enjoyed one another’s company  speech interchanging each day looks  affection  kindness what did their tears imply did they really express pain i   first unable  solve these questions but perpetual attention  time explained  me many appearances which   first enigmatic “a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one   causes   uneasiness  this amiable family   poverty  they suffered  evil   very distressing degree their nourishment consisted entirely   vegetables  their garden   milk  one cow which gave very little during  winter when  masters could scarcely procure food  support it they often i believe suffered  pangs  hunger very poignantly especially  two younger cottagers  several times they placed food before  old man when they reserved none  themselves “this trait  kindness moved me sensibly i had been accustomed during  night  steal  part  their store  my own consumption but when i found   doing this i inflicted pain   cottagers i abstained  satisfied myself  berries nuts  roots which i gathered   neighbouring wood “i discovered also another means through which i  enabled  assist their labours i found   youth spent  great part  each day  collecting wood   family fire  during  night i often took his tools  use  which i quickly discovered  brought home firing sufficient   consumption  several days “i remember  first time  i did this  young woman when she opened  door   morning appeared greatly astonished  seeing  great pile  wood   outside she uttered some words   loud voice   youth joined her who also expressed surprise i observed  pleasure   did not go   forest  day but spent   repairing  cottage  cultivating  garden “by degrees i made  discovery  still greater moment i found  these people possessed  method  communicating their experience  feelings  one another  articulate sounds i perceived   words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness   minds  countenances   hearers this  indeed  godlike science  i ardently desired  become acquainted  it but i  baffled  every attempt i made  this purpose their pronunciation  quick   words they uttered not having any apparent connection  visible objects i  unable  discover any clue  which i could unravel  mystery  their reference by great application however  after having remained during  space  several revolutions   moon  my hovel i discovered  names   given  some   most familiar objects  discourse i learned  applied  words fire milk bread  wood i learned also  names   cottagers themselves the youth  his companion had each  them several names but  old man had only one which  father the girl  called sister or agatha   youth felix brother or son i cannot describe  delight i felt when i learned  ideas appropriated  each  these sounds   able  pronounce them i distinguished several other words without being able  yet  understand or apply them such  good dearest unhappy “i spent  winter  this manner the gentle manners  beauty   cottagers greatly endeared them  me when they  unhappy i felt depressed when they rejoiced i sympathised  their joys i saw few human beings besides them  if any other happened  enter  cottage their harsh manners  rude gait only enhanced  me  superior accomplishments  my friends the old man i could perceive often endeavoured  encourage his children  sometimes i found   called them  cast off their melancholy he would talk   cheerful accent   expression  goodness  bestowed pleasure even upon me agatha listened  respect her eyes sometimes filled  tears which she endeavoured  wipe away unperceived but i generally found  her countenance  tone  more cheerful after having listened   exhortations  her father it  not thus  felix he  always  saddest   group  even  my unpractised senses  appeared  have suffered more deeply than his friends but if his countenance  more sorrowful his voice  more cheerful than   his sister especially when  addressed  old man “i could mention innumerable instances which although slight marked  dispositions  these amiable cottagers in  midst  poverty  want felix carried  pleasure  his sister  first little white flower  peeped out  beneath  snowy ground early

little  do   frosty season  read   old man  agatha “this reading had puzzled me extremely  first but  degrees i discovered   uttered many   same sounds when  read  when  talked i conjectured therefore   found   paper signs  speech which  understood  i ardently longed  comprehend these also but how   possible when i did not even understand  sounds  which they stood  signs i improved however sensibly  this science but not sufficiently  follow up any kind  conversation although i applied my whole mind   endeavour  i easily perceived that although i eagerly longed  discover myself   cottagers i ought not  make  attempt until i had first become master  their language which knowledge might enable me  make them overlook  deformity  my figure   this also  contrast perpetually presented  my eyes had made me acquainted “i had admired  perfect forms  my cottagers—their grace beauty  delicate complexions but how  i terrified when i viewed myself   transparent pool at first i started back unable  believe    indeed i who  reflected   mirror  when i became fully convinced  i   reality  monster  i am i  filled   bitterest sensations  despondence  mortification alas i did not yet entirely know  fatal effects  this miserable deformity “as  sun became warmer   light  day longer  snow vanished  i beheld  bare trees   black earth from this time felix  more employed   heartmoving indications  impending famine disappeared their food  i afterwards found  coarse but   wholesome  they procured  sufficiency  it several new kinds  plants sprang up   garden which they dressed  these signs  comfort increased daily   season advanced “the old man leaning  his son walked each day  noon when  did not rain  i found   called when  heavens poured forth  waters this frequently took place but  high wind quickly dried  earth   season became far more pleasant than  had been “my mode  life  my hovel  uniform during  morning i attended  motions   cottagers  when they  dispersed  various

but i profited   others “as night came on agatha   arabian retired early when they separated felix kissed  hand   stranger  said ‘good night sweet safie’ he sat up much longer conversing  his father    frequent repetition  her name i conjectured  their lovely guest   subject  their conversation i ardently desired  understand them  bent every faculty towards  purpose but found  utterly impossible “the next morning felix went out  his work  after  usual occupations  agatha  finished  arabian sat   feet   old man  taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful  they  once drew tears  sorrow  delight  my eyes she sang  her voice flowed   rich cadence swelling or dying away like  nightingale   woods “when she had finished she gave  guitar  agatha who  first declined it she played  simple air  her voice accompanied   sweet accents but unlike  wondrous strain   stranger the old man appeared enraptured  said some words which agatha endeavoured  explain  safie   which  appeared  wish  express  she bestowed  him  greatest delight  her music “the days now passed  peaceably  before   sole alteration  joy had taken place  sadness   countenances  my friends safie  always gay  happy she  i improved rapidly   knowledge  language so   two months i began  comprehend most   words uttered  my protectors “in  meanwhile also  black ground  covered  herbage   green banks interspersed  innumerable flowers sweet   scent   eyes stars  pale radiance among  moonlight woods  sun became warmer  nights clear  balmy  my nocturnal rambles   extreme pleasure  me although they  considerably shortened   late setting  early rising   sun  i never ventured abroad during daylight fearful  meeting   same treatment i had formerly endured   first village which i entered “my days  spent  close attention  i might more speedily master  language  i may boast  i improved more rapidly than  arabian who understood very little  conversed  broken accents whilst i comprehended  could imitate almost every word   spoken “while i improved  speech i also learned  science  letters    taught   stranger  this opened before me  wide field  wonder  delight “the book  which felix instructed safie  volney’s ruins  empires i should not have understood  purport  this book had not felix  reading it given very minute explanations he had chosen this work  said because  declamatory style  framed  imitation   eastern authors through this work i obtained  cursory knowledge  history   view   several empires  present existing   world  gave me  insight into  manners governments  religions   different nations   earth i heard   slothful asiatics   stupendous genius  mental activity   grecians   wars  wonderful virtue   early romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of  decline   mighty empire  chivalry christianity  kings i heard   discovery   american hemisphere  wept  safie over  hapless fate   original inhabitants “these wonderful narrations inspired me  strange feelings was man indeed  once so powerful so virtuous  magnificent yet so vicious  base he appeared  one time  mere scion   evil principle   another  all  can  conceived  noble  godlike to   great  virtuous man appeared  highest honour  can befall  sensitive being   base  vicious  many  record have been appeared  lowest degradation  condition more abject than    blind mole or harmless worm for  long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth  murder his fellow or even why there  laws  governments but when i heard details  vice  bloodshed my wonder ceased  i turned away  disgust  loathing “every conversation   cottagers now opened new wonders  me while i listened   instructions which felix bestowed upon  arabian  strange system  human society  explained  me i heard   division  property  immense wealth  squalid poverty  rank descent  noble blood “the words induced me  turn towards myself i learned   possessions most esteemed  your fellow creatures  high  unsullied descent united  riches a man might  respected  only one  these advantages but without either   considered except  very rare instances   vagabond   slave doomed  waste his powers   profits   chosen few and what  i of my creation  creator i  absolutely ignorant but i knew  i possessed no money no friends no kind  property i was besides endued   figure hideously deformed  loathsome i  not even   same nature  man i  more agile than they  could subsist upon coarser diet i bore  extremes  heat  cold  less injury  my frame my stature far exceeded theirs when i looked around i saw  heard  none like me was i then  monster  blot upon  earth  which all men fled  whom all men disowned “i cannot describe  you  agony  these reflections inflicted upon me i tried  dispel them but sorrow only increased  knowledge oh  i had  ever remained  my native wood nor known nor felt beyond  sensations  hunger thirst  heat “of what  strange nature  knowledge it clings   mind when   once seized   like  lichen   rock i wished sometimes  shake off all thought  feeling but i learned  there  but one means  overcome  sensation  pain    death—a state which i feared yet did not understand i admired virtue  good feelings  loved  gentle manners  amiable qualities  my cottagers but i  shut out  intercourse  them except through means which i obtained  stealth when i  unseen  unknown  which rather increased than satisfied  desire i had  becoming one among my fellows the gentle words  agatha   animated smiles   charming arabian  not  me the mild exhortations   old man   lively conversation   loved felix  not  me miserable unhappy wretch “other lessons  impressed upon me even more deeply i heard   difference  sexes   birth  growth  children how  father doted   smiles   infant   lively sallies   older child how all  life  cares   mother  wrapped up   precious charge how  mind  youth expanded  gained knowledge  brother sister  all  various relationships which bind one human being  another  mutual bonds “but where  my friends  relations no father had watched my infant days no mother had blessed me  smiles  caresses or if they had all my past life  now  blot  blind vacancy  which i distinguished nothing from my earliest remembrance i had been  i then   height  proportion i had never yet seen  being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse  me what  i the question again recurred   answered only  groans “i  soon explain  what these feelings tended but allow me now  return   cottagers whose story excited  me such various feelings  indignation delight  wonder but which all terminated  additional love  reverence  my protectors for so i loved   innocent halfpainful selfdeceit  call them” chapter  “some time elapsed before i learned  history  my friends it  one which could not fail  impress itself

mankind “as yet i looked upon crime   distant evil benevolence  generosity  ever present before me inciting within me  desire  become  actor   busy scene where so many admirable qualities  called forth  displayed but  giving  account   progress  my intellect i must not omit  circumstance which occurred   beginning   month  august   same year “one night during my accustomed visit   neighbouring wood where i collected my own food  brought home firing  my protectors i found   ground  leathern portmanteau containing several articles  dress  some books i eagerly seized  prize  returned    my hovel fortunately  books  written   language  elements  which i had acquired   cottage they consisted  paradise lost  volume  plutarch’s lives   sorrows  werter the possession  these treasures gave me extreme delight i now continually studied  exercised my mind upon these histories whilst my friends  employed  their ordinary occupations “i can hardly describe  you  effect  these books they produced  me  infinity  new images  feelings  sometimes raised me  ecstasy but more frequently sunk me into  lowest dejection in  sorrows  werter besides  interest   simple  affecting story so many opinions  canvassed  so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been  me obscure subjects  i found    neverending source  speculation  astonishment the gentle  domestic manners  described combined  lofty sentiments  feelings which had  their object something out  self accorded well  my experience among my protectors    wants which   ever alive  my own bosom but i thought werter himself  more divine being than i had ever beheld or imagined his character contained no pretension but  sank deep the disquisitions upon death  suicide  calculated  fill me  wonder i did not pretend  enter into  merits   case yet i inclined towards  opinions   hero whose extinction i wept without precisely understanding it “as i read however i applied much personally  my own feelings  condition i found myself similar yet   same time strangely unlike   beings concerning whom i read   whose conversation i   listener i sympathised   partly understood them but i  unformed  mind i  dependent  none  related  none ‘the path  my departure  free’  there  none  lament my annihilation my person  hideous  my stature gigantic what did this mean who  i what  i whence did i come what  my destination these questions continually recurred but i  unable  solve them “the volume  plutarch’s lives which i possessed contained  histories   first founders   ancient republics this book had  far different effect upon me   sorrows  werter i learned  werter’s imaginations despondency  gloom but plutarch taught me high thoughts  elevated me above  wretched sphere  my own reflections  admire  love  heroes  past ages many things i read surpassed my understanding  experience i had  very confused knowledge  kingdoms wide extents  country mighty rivers  boundless seas but i  perfectly unacquainted  towns  large assemblages  men the cottage  my protectors had been  only school  which i had studied human nature but this book developed new  mightier scenes  action i read  men concerned  public affairs governing or massacring their species i felt  greatest ardour  virtue rise within me  abhorrence  vice  far  i understood  signification  those terms relative  they were  i applied them  pleasure  pain alone induced  these feelings i   course led  admire peaceable lawgivers numa solon  lycurgus  preference  romulus  theseus the patriarchal lives  my protectors caused these impressions  take  firm hold  my mind perhaps if my first introduction  humanity had been made   young soldier burning  glory  slaughter i should have been imbued  different sensations “but paradise lost excited different  far deeper emotions i read it  i had read  other volumes which had fallen into my hands   true history it moved every feeling  wonder  awe   picture   omnipotent god warring  his creatures  capable  exciting i often referred  several situations  their similarity struck me  my own like adam i  apparently united  no link  any other being  existence but his state  far different  mine  every other respect he had come forth   hands  god  perfect creature happy  prosperous guarded   especial care  his creator   allowed  converse   acquire knowledge  beings   superior nature but i  wretched helpless  alone many times i considered satan   fitter emblem  my condition  often like him when i viewed  bliss  my protectors  bitter gall  envy rose within me “another circumstance strengthened  confirmed these feelings soon after my arrival   hovel i discovered some papers   pocket   dress which i had taken  your laboratory at first i had neglected them but now  i  able  decipher  characters  which they  written i began  study them  diligence it  your journal   four months  preceded my creation you minutely described  these papers every step you took   progress  your work this history  mingled  accounts  domestic occurrences you doubtless recollect these papers here they are everything  related  them which bears reference  my accursed origin  whole detail   series  disgusting circumstances which produced   set  view  minutest description  my odious  loathsome person  given  language which painted your own horrors  rendered mine indelible i sickened  i read ‘hateful day when i received life’ i exclaimed  agony ‘accursed creator why did you form  monster so hideous  even you turned  me  disgust god  pity made man beautiful  alluring after his own image but my form   filthy type  yours more horrid even   very resemblance satan had his companions fellow devils  admire  encourage him but i am solitary  abhorred’ “these   reflections  my hours  despondency  solitude but when i contemplated  virtues   cottagers their amiable  benevolent dispositions i persuaded myself  when they should become acquainted  my admiration  their virtues they would compassionate me  overlook my personal deformity could they turn  their door one however monstrous who solicited their compassion  friendship i resolved  least not  despair but  every way  fit myself   interview  them which would decide my fate i postponed this attempt  some months longer   importance attached   success inspired me   dread lest i should fail besides i found  my understanding improved so much  every day’s experience  i  unwilling  commence this undertaking until  few more months should have added  my sagacity “several changes   meantime took place   cottage the presence  safie diffused happiness among  inhabitants  i also found   greater degree  plenty reigned there felix  agatha spent more time  amusement  conversation   assisted  their labours  servants they did not appear rich but they  contented  happy their feelings  serene  peaceful while mine became every day more tumultuous increase  knowledge only discovered  me more clearly what  wretched outcast i was i cherished hope   true but  vanished when i beheld my person reflected  water or my shadow   moonshine even   frail image   inconstant shade “i endeavoured  crush these fears   fortify myself   trial which   few months i resolved  undergo  sometimes i allowed my thoughts unchecked  reason  ramble   fields  paradise  dared  fancy amiable  lovely creatures sympathising  my feelings  cheering my gloom their angelic countenances breathed smiles  consolation but   all  dream no eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts i  alone i remembered adam’s supplication  his creator but where  mine he had abandoned me    bitterness  my heart i cursed him “autumn passed thus i saw  surprise  grief  leaves decay  fall  nature again assume  barren  bleak appearance  had worn when i first beheld  woods   lovely moon yet i did not heed  bleakness   weather i  better fitted  my conformation   endurance  cold than heat but my chief delights   sight   flowers  birds  all  gay apparel  summer when those deserted me i turned  more attention towards  cottagers their happiness  not decreased   absence  summer they loved  sympathised  one another  their joys depending  each other  not interrupted   casualties  took place around them the more i saw  them  greater became my desire  claim their protection  kindness my heart yearned   known  loved  these amiable creatures  see their sweet looks directed towards me  affection   utmost limit  my ambition i dared not think  they would turn them  me  disdain  horror the poor  stopped  their door  never driven away i asked   true  greater treasures than  little food or rest i required kindness  sympathy but i did not believe myself utterly unworthy  it “the winter advanced   entire revolution   seasons had taken place since i awoke into life my attention  this time  solely directed towards my plan  introducing myself into  cottage  my protectors i revolved many projects but   which i finally fixed   enter  dwelling when  blind old man should  alone i had sagacity enough  discover   unnatural hideousness  my person   chief object  horror  those who had formerly beheld me my voice although harsh had nothing terrible  it i thought therefore  if   absence

denied warmth safie agatha  felix departed   long country walk   old man  his own desire  left alone   cottage when his children had departed  took up his guitar  played several mournful but sweet airs more sweet  mournful than i had ever heard him play before at first his countenance  illuminated  pleasure but   continued thoughtfulness  sadness succeeded  length laying aside  instrument  sat absorbed  reflection “my heart beat quick this   hour  moment  trial which would decide my hopes or realise my fears the servants  gone   neighbouring fair all  silent   around  cottage    excellent opportunity yet when i proceeded  execute my plan my limbs failed me  i sank   ground again i rose  exerting all  firmness  which i  master removed  planks which i had placed before my hovel  conceal my retreat the fresh air revived me   renewed determination i approached  door  their cottage “i knocked ‘who  there’ said  old man ‘come in’ “i entered ‘pardon this intrusion’ said i ‘i am  traveller  want   little rest you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me  remain  few minutes before  fire’ “‘enter’ said de lacey ‘and i  try  what manner i can  relieve your wants but unfortunately my children   home   i am blind i am afraid i shall find  difficult  procure food  you’ “‘do not trouble yourself my kind host i have food   warmth  rest only  i need’ “i sat down   silence ensued i knew  every minute  precious  me yet i remained irresolute  what manner  commence  interview when  old man addressed me ‘by your language stranger i suppose you  my countryman  you french’ “‘no but i  educated   french family  understand  language only i am now going  claim  protection  some friends whom i sincerely love   whose favour i have some hopes’ “‘are they germans’ “‘no they  french but

paused  then continued ‘if you  unreservedly confide  me  particulars  your tale i perhaps may   use  undeceiving them i am blind  cannot judge  your countenance but there  something  your words which

sank   chair  sobbed aloud at  moment i heard  steps  my younger protectors i had not  moment  lose but seizing  hand   old man i cried ‘now   time save  protect me you  your family   friends whom i

you had so wantonly bestowed i know not despair had not yet taken possession  me my feelings  those  rage  revenge i could  pleasure have destroyed  cottage   inhabitants  have glutted myself  their shrieks  misery “when night came i quitted my retreat  wandered   wood  now no longer restrained   fear  discovery i gave vent  my anguish  fearful howlings i  like  wild beast  had broken  toils destroying  objects  obstructed me  ranging through  wood   staglike swiftness oh what  miserable night i passed the cold stars shone  mockery   bare trees waved their branches above me now  then  sweet voice   bird burst forth amidst  universal stillness all save i   rest or  enjoyment i like  archfiend bore  hell within me  finding myself unsympathised with wished  tear up  trees spread havoc

 none among  myriads  men  existed who would pity or assist me  should i feel kindness towards my enemies no   moment i declared everlasting war against  species  more than all against him who had formed me  sent me forth  this insupportable misery “the sun rose i heard  voices  men  knew    impossible  return  my retreat during  day accordingly i hid myself  some thick underwood determining  devote  ensuing hours  reflection  my situation “the pleasant sunshine   pure air  day restored me  some degree  tranquillity  when i considered what had passed   cottage i could not help believing  i had been too hasty  my conclusions i had certainly acted imprudently it  apparent  my conversation had interested  father  my behalf  i   fool  having exposed my person   horror  his children i ought  have familiarised  old de lacey  me   degrees  have discovered myself   rest  his family when they should have been prepared  my approach but i did not believe my errors   irretrievable  after much consideration i resolved  return   cottage seek  old man   my representations win him  my party “these thoughts calmed me    afternoon i sank into  profound sleep but  fever  my blood did not allow me   visited  peaceful dreams the horrible scene   preceding day   ever acting before my eyes  females  flying   enraged felix tearing me  his father’s feet i awoke exhausted  finding    already night i crept forth  my hidingplace  went  search  food “when my hunger  appeased i directed my steps towards  wellknown path  conducted   cottage all there   peace i crept into my hovel  remained  silent expectation   accustomed hour when  family arose that hour passed  sun mounted high   heavens but  cottagers did not appear i trembled violently apprehending some dreadful misfortune the inside   cottage  dark  i heard no motion i cannot describe  agony  this suspense “presently two countrymen passed by but pausing near  cottage they entered into conversation using violent gesticulations but i did not understand what they said  they spoke  language   country which differed    my protectors soon after however felix approached  another man i  surprised  i knew   had not quitted  cottage  morning  waited anxiously  discover  his discourse  meaning  these unusual appearances “‘do you consider’ said his companion  him ‘that you   obliged  pay three months’ rent   lose  produce  your

life  my father    greatest danger owing   dreadful circumstance  i have related my wife  my sister  never recover  their horror i entreat you not  reason  me any more take possession  your tenement  let me fly  this place’ “felix trembled violently   said this he  his companion entered  cottage  which they remained   few minutes  then departed i never saw any   family  de lacey more “i continued   remainder   day  my hovel   state  utter  stupid despair my protectors had departed  had broken  only link  held me   world for  first time  feelings  revenge  hatred filled my bosom  i did not

these thoughts vanished   gush  tears somewhat soothed me but again when i reflected  they had spurned  deserted me anger returned  rage  anger  unable  injure anything human i turned my fury towards inanimate objects as night advanced i placed  variety  combustibles around  cottage  after having destroyed every vestige  cultivation   garden i waited  forced impatience until  moon had sunk

long resided i travelled only  night fearful  encountering  visage   human being nature decayed around me   sun became heatless rain  snow poured around me mighty rivers  frozen  surface   earth  hard  chill  bare  i found no shelter oh earth how often did i imprecate curses   cause  my being the mildness  my nature had fled  all within me  turned  gall  bitterness the nearer i approached  your

wandered wide  my path the agony  my feelings allowed me no respite no incident occurred  which my rage  misery could not extract  food but  circumstance  happened when i arrived   confines

 night   view  man one morning however finding  my path lay through  deep wood i ventured  continue my journey after  sun had risen  day which  one   first  spring cheered even me   loveliness   sunshine   balminess   air i felt emotions  gentleness  pleasure  had long appeared dead revive within me half surprised   novelty  these sensations i allowed myself   borne away  them  forgetting my solitude  deformity dared   happy soft tears again bedewed my cheeks  i even raised my humid eyes  thankfulness towards  blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me “i continued  wind among  paths   wood until i came   boundary which  skirted   deep  rapid river into which many   trees bent their branches now budding   fresh spring here i paused not exactly knowing what path  pursue when i heard  sound  voices  induced me  conceal myself under  shade   cypress i  scarcely hid when  young girl came running towards  spot where i  concealed laughing  if she ran  someone  sport she continued her

tearing  girl  my arms hastened towards  deeper parts   wood i followed speedily i hardly knew why but when  man saw me draw near  aimed  gun which  carried  my body  fired i sank   ground  my injurer  increased swiftness escaped into  wood “this  then  reward  my benevolence i had saved  human being  destruction    recompense i now writhed under  miserable pain   wound which shattered  flesh  bone the feelings  kindness  gentleness which i had entertained but  few moments before gave place  hellish rage  gnashing  teeth inflamed  pain i vowed eternal hatred  vengeance  all mankind but  agony  my wound overcame me my pulses paused  i fainted “for some weeks i led  miserable life   woods endeavouring  cure  wound which i had received the ball had entered my shoulder  i knew not whether  had remained there or passed through  any rate i had no means  extracting it my sufferings  augmented also   oppressive sense   injustice  ingratitude  their infliction my daily vows rose  revenge—a deep  deadly revenge such  would alone compensate   outrages  anguish i had endured “after some weeks my wound healed  i continued my journey the labours i endured  no longer   alleviated   bright sun or gentle breezes  spring all joy  but  mockery which insulted my desolate state  made me feel more painfully  i  not made   enjoyment  pleasure “but my toils now drew near  close   two months  this time i reached  environs  geneva “it  evening when i arrived  i retired   hidingplace among  fields  surround   meditate  what manner i should apply  you i  oppressed  fatigue  hunger  far too unhappy

beheld my form  placed his hands before his eyes  uttered  shrill scream i drew his hand forcibly  his face  said ‘child what   meaning  this i do not intend  hurt you listen  me’ “he struggled violently ‘let me go’  cried ‘monster ugly wretch you wish  eat me  tear me  pieces you   ogre let me go or i  tell my papa’ “‘boy you  never see your father again you must come  me’ “‘hideous monster let me go my papa   syndic—he  m frankenstein—he  punish you you dare not keep me’ “‘frankenstein you belong then  my enemy—to him towards whom i have sworn eternal revenge you shall  my first victim’ “the child still struggled  loaded me  epithets which carried despair  my heart i grasped his throat  silence him    moment  lay dead  my feet “i gazed  my victim  my heart swelled  exultation  hellish triumph clapping my hands i exclaimed ‘i too can create desolation my enemy  not invulnerable this death  carry despair  him   thousand other miseries shall torment  destroy him’ “as i fixed my eyes   child i saw something glittering  his breast i took it    portrait   most lovely woman in spite  my malignity  softened  attracted me for  few moments i gazed  delight  her dark eyes fringed  deep lashes  her lovely lips but presently my rage returned i remembered  i   ever deprived   delights  such beautiful creatures could bestow   she whose resemblance i contemplated would  regarding me have changed  air  divine benignity  one expressive  disgust  affright “can you wonder  such thoughts transported me  rage i only wonder    moment instead  venting my sensations  exclamations  agony i did not rush among mankind  perish   attempt  destroy them “while i  overcome  these feelings i left  spot where i had committed  murder  seeking  more secluded hidingplace i entered  barn which had appeared  me   empty a woman  sleeping  some straw she  young not indeed so beautiful  her whose portrait i held but   agreeable aspect  blooming   loveliness  youth  health here i thought  one  those whose joyimparting smiles  bestowed  all but me and then i bent over her  whispered ‘awake fairest thy lover  near—he who would give his life but  obtain one look  affection  thine eyes my

haunted  spot where these scenes had taken place sometimes wishing  see you sometimes resolved  quit  world   miseries  ever at length i wandered towards these mountains  have ranged through their

expectation   reply but i  bewildered perplexed  unable  arrange my ideas sufficiently  understand  full extent  his proposition he continued “you must create  female  me  whom i can live   interchange  those sympathies necessary  my being this you alone can do  i demand   you   right which you must not refuse  concede” the latter part  his tale had kindled anew  me  anger  had died away while  narrated his peaceful life among  cottagers    said this i could no longer suppress  rage  burned within me “i do refuse it” i replied “and no torture shall ever extort  consent  me you may render me  most miserable  men but you shall never make me base  my own eyes shall i create another like yourself whose joint wickedness might desolate  world begone i have answered you you may torture me but i  never consent” “you    wrong” replied  fiend “and instead  threatening i am content  reason  you i am malicious because i am miserable am i not shunned  hated  all mankind you my

animated him   said this his face  wrinkled into contortions too horrible  human eyes  behold but presently  calmed himself  proceeded— “i intended  reason this passion  detrimental  me  you do not

there  some justice  his argument his tale   feelings  now expressed proved him    creature  fine sensations  did i not  his maker owe him all  portion  happiness     my power  bestow he saw my change

talked my heart sickened  my feelings  altered  those  horror  hatred i tried  stifle these sensations i thought   i could not sympathise  him i had no right  withhold  him  small portion  happiness which  yet  my power  bestow “you swear” i said “to  harmless but have you not already shown  degree  malice  should reasonably make me distrust you may not even this   feint   increase your triumph

concluded   justice due both  him  my fellow creatures demanded  me  i should comply  his request turning  him therefore i said “i consent  your demand  your solemn oath  quit europe  ever  every

here  charles i had collected his forces this city had remained faithful  him after  whole nation had forsaken his cause  join  standard  parliament  liberty the memory   unfortunate king  his companions  amiable falkland  insolent goring his queen  son gave  peculiar interest  every part   city which they might  supposed  have inhabited the spirit  elder days found  dwelling here  we delighted  trace  footsteps if these feelings had not found  imaginary gratification  appearance   city had yet  itself sufficient beauty  obtain our admiration the colleges  ancient  picturesque  streets  almost magnificent   lovely isis which flows beside  through meadows  exquisite verdure  spread forth into  placid expanse  waters which reflects  majestic assemblage  towers  spires  domes embosomed among aged trees i enjoyed this scene  yet my enjoyment  embittered both   memory   past   anticipation   future i  formed  peaceful happiness during my youthful days discontent never

passed  considerable period  oxford rambling among  environs  endeavouring  identify every spot which might relate   most animating epoch  english history our little voyages  discovery  often prolonged   successive objects  presented themselves we visited  tomb   illustrious hampden   field  which  patriot fell for  moment my soul  elevated   debasing  miserable fears  contemplate  divine ideas  liberty  selfsacrifice  which these sights   monuments   remembrancers for  instant i dared  shake off my chains  look around me   free  lofty spirit but  iron had eaten into my flesh  i sank again trembling  hopeless into my miserable self we left oxford  regret  proceeded  matlock which  our next place  rest the country   neighbourhood  this village resembled   greater degree  scenery  switzerland but everything    lower scale   green hills want  crown  distant white alps which always attend   piny mountains  my native country we visited  wondrous cave   little cabinets  natural

associated from derby still journeying northwards we passed two months  cumberland  westmorland i could now almost fancy myself among  swiss mountains the little patches  snow which yet lingered   northern sides   mountains  lakes   dashing   rocky streams  all familiar  dear sights  me here also we made some acquaintances who almost contrived  cheat me into happiness the delight  clerval  proportionably greater than mine his mind expanded   company  men  talent   found  his own nature greater capacities  resources than  could have imagined himself  have possessed while  associated  his inferiors “i could pass my life here” said   me “and among these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland   rhine” but  found   traveller’s life  one  includes much pain amidst  enjoyments his feelings   ever   stretch  when  begins  sink into repose  finds himself obliged  quit   which  rests  pleasure  something new which again engages his attention  which also  forsakes  other novelties we had scarcely visited  various lakes  cumberland  westmorland  conceived  affection  some   inhabitants when  period  our appointment  our scotch friend approached  we left them  travel on for my own part i  not sorry i had now neglected my promise  some time  i feared  effects   dæmon’s disappointment he might remain  switzerland  wreak his vengeance  my relatives this idea pursued me  tormented me  every moment  which i might otherwise have snatched repose  peace i waited  my letters  feverish impatience if they  delayed i  miserable  overcome   thousand fears  when they arrived  i saw  superscription  elizabeth or my father i hardly dared  read  ascertain my fate sometimes i thought   fiend followed me  might expedite my remissness  murdering my companion when these thoughts possessed me i would not quit henry   moment but followed him  his shadow  protect him   fancied rage  his destroyer i felt  if i had committed some great crime  consciousness  which haunted me i  guiltless but i had indeed drawn down  horrible curse upon my head  mortal    crime i visited edinburgh  languid eyes  mind  yet  city might have interested  most unfortunate being clerval did not like  so well  oxford   antiquity   latter city  more pleasing  him but  beauty  regularity   new town  edinburgh  romantic castle   environs  most delightful   world arthur’s seat st bernard’s well   pentland hills compensated him   change  filled him  cheerfulness  admiration but i  impatient  arrive   termination  my journey we left edinburgh   week passing through coupar st andrew’s  along  banks   tay  perth where our friend expected us but i   no mood  laugh  talk  strangers or enter into their feelings or plans   good humour expected   guest  accordingly i told clerval  i wished  make  tour  scotland alone “do you” said i “enjoy yourself  let this  our rendezvous i may  absent  month or two but do not interfere  my motions i entreat you leave me  peace  solitude   short time  when i return i hope      lighter heart more congenial  your own temper” henry wished  dissuade me but seeing me bent  this plan ceased  remonstrate he entreated me  write often “i had rather   you”  said “in your solitary rambles than  these scotch people whom i do not know hasten then my dear friend  return  i may again feel myself somewhat  home which i cannot do  your absence” having parted  my friend i determined  visit some remote spot  scotland  finish my work  solitude i did not doubt but   monster followed me  would discover himself  me when i should have finished   might receive his companion with this resolution i traversed  northern highlands  fixed  one   remotest   orkneys   scene  my labours it   place fitted  such  work being hardly more than  rock whose high sides  continually beaten upon   waves the soil  barren scarcely affording pasture   few miserable cows  oatmeal   inhabitants which consisted  five persons whose gaunt  scraggy limbs gave tokens  their miserable fare vegetables  bread when they indulged  such luxuries  even fresh water    procured   mainland which  about five miles distant on  whole island there  but three miserable huts  one  these  vacant when i arrived this i hired it contained but two rooms  these exhibited all  squalidness   most miserable penury the thatch had fallen in  walls  unplastered   door  off  hinges i ordered    repaired bought some furniture  took possession  incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all  senses   cottagers been benumbed  want  squalid poverty as  was i lived ungazed   unmolested hardly thanked   pittance  food  clothes which i gave so much does suffering blunt even  coarsest sensations  men in this retreat i devoted  morning  labour but   evening when  weather permitted i walked   stony beach   sea  listen   waves  they roared  dashed  my feet it   monotonous yet everchanging scene i thought  switzerland   far different  this desolate  appalling landscape its hills  covered  vines   cottages  scattered thickly   plains its fair lakes reflect  blue  gentle sky  when troubled   winds their tumult  but   play   lively infant when compared   roarings   giant ocean in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived but  i proceeded  my labour  became every day more horrible  irksome  me sometimes i could not prevail  myself  enter my laboratory  several days   other times i toiled day  night  order  complete my work it was indeed  filthy process  which i  engaged during my first experiment  kind  enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me   horror  my employment my mind  intently fixed   consummation  my labour  my eyes  shut   horror  my proceedings but now i went    cold blood  my heart often sickened   work  my hands thus situated employed   most detestable occupation immersed   solitude where nothing could   instant call my attention   actual scene  which i  engaged my spirits became unequal i grew restless  nervous every moment i feared  meet my persecutor sometimes i sat  my eyes fixed   ground fearing  raise them lest they should encounter  object which i so much dreaded  behold i feared  wander   sight  my fellow creatures lest when alone  should come  claim his companion in  mean time i worked on  my labour  already considerably advanced i looked towards  completion   tremulous  eager hope which i dared not trust myself  question but which  intermixed  obscure forebodings  evil  made my heart sicken  my bosom chapter  i sat one evening  my laboratory  sun had set   moon  just rising   sea i had not sufficient light  my employment  i remained idle   pause  consideration  whether i should leave my labour   night or hasten  conclusion   unremitting attention  it as i sat  train  reflection

trembled  my heart failed within me when  looking up i saw   light   moon  dæmon   casement a ghastly grin wrinkled his lips   gazed  me where i sat fulfilling  task which  had allotted  me yes  had

steps i sought my own apartment i  alone none  near me  dissipate  gloom  relieve me   sickening oppression   most terrible reveries several hours passed  i remained near my window gazing   sea   almost motionless   winds  hushed  all nature reposed under  eye   quiet moon a few fishing vessels alone specked  water  now  then  gentle breeze wafted  sound  voices   fishermen called  one another i felt  silence although i  hardly conscious   extreme profundity until my ear  suddenly arrested   paddling  oars near  shore   person landed close  my house in  few minutes after i heard  creaking  my door  if some one endeavoured  open  softly i trembled  head  foot i felt  presentiment  who    wished  rouse one   peasants who dwelt   cottage not far  mine but i  overcome   sensation  helplessness so often felt  frightful dreams when you  vain endeavour  fly   impending danger   rooted   spot presently i heard  sound  footsteps along  passage  door opened   wretch whom i dreaded appeared shutting  door  approached me  said   smothered voice “you have destroyed  work which you began what    you intend do you dare  break your promise i have endured toil  misery i left switzerland  you i crept along  shores   rhine among  willow islands  over  summits   hills i have dwelt many months   heaths  england  among  deserts  scotland i have endured incalculable fatigue  cold  hunger do you dare destroy my hopes” “begone i do break my promise never  i create another like yourself equal  deformity  wickedness” “slave i before reasoned  you but you have proved yourself

go but remember i shall   you  your weddingnight” i started forward  exclaimed “villain before you sign my deathwarrant  sure  you  yourself safe” i would have seized him but  eluded me  quitted  house  precipitation in  few moments i saw him  his boat which shot across  waters   arrowy swiftness   soon lost amidst  waves all  again silent but his words rang  my ears i burned  rage  pursue  murderer  my peace  precipitate him into  ocean i walked up  down my room hastily  perturbed while my imagination conjured up  thousand images  torment  sting me why had i not followed him  closed  him  mortal strife but i had suffered him  depart   had directed his course towards  mainland i shuddered  think who might   next victim sacrificed  his insatiate revenge and then i thought again  his words—“i    you  your weddingnight” that then   period fixed   fulfilment  my destiny in  hour i should die   once satisfy  extinguish his malice the prospect did not move me  fear yet when i thought  my beloved elizabeth  her tears  endless sorrow when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched  her tears  first i had shed  many months streamed  my eyes  i resolved not  fall before my enemy without  bitter struggle the night passed away   sun rose   ocean my feelings became calmer if  may  called calmness when  violence  rage sinks into  depths  despair i left  house  horrid scene   last night’s contention  walked   beach   sea which i almost regarded   insuperable barrier between me  my fellow creatures nay  wish  such should prove  fact stole across me i desired  i might pass my life   barren rock wearily   true but uninterrupted  any sudden shock  misery if i returned     sacrificed or  see those whom i most loved die under  grasp   dæmon whom i had myself created i walked about  isle like  restless spectre separated  all  loved  miserable   separation when  became noon   sun rose higher i lay down   grass   overpowered   deep sleep i had been awake  whole   preceding night my nerves  agitated  my eyes inflamed  watching  misery the sleep into which i now sank refreshed me  when i awoke i again felt  if i belonged   race  human beings like myself  i began  reflect upon what had passed  greater composure yet still  words   fiend rang  my ears like  deathknell they appeared like  dream yet distinct  oppressive   reality the sun had far descended  i still sat   shore satisfying my appetite which had become ravenous   oaten cake when i saw  fishingboat land close  me  one   men brought me  packet  contained letters  geneva  one  clerval entreating me  join him he said    wearing away his time fruitlessly where  was  letters   friends  had formed  london desired his return  complete  negotiation they had entered into  his indian enterprise he could not any longer delay his departure but  his journey  london might  followed even sooner than  now conjectured  his longer voyage  entreated me  bestow  much  my society  him  i could spare he besought me therefore  leave my solitary isle   meet him  perth  we might proceed southwards together this letter   degree recalled me  life  i determined  quit my island   expiration  two days yet before i departed there   task  perform  which i shuddered  reflect i must pack up my chemical instruments    purpose i must enter  room which had been  scene  my odious work  i must handle those utensils  sight  which  sickening  me the next morning  daybreak i summoned sufficient courage  unlocked  door  my laboratory the remains   halffinished creature whom i had destroyed lay scattered   floor  i almost felt  if i had mangled  living flesh   human being i paused  collect myself  then entered  chamber with trembling hand i conveyed  instruments out   room but i reflected  i ought not  leave  relics  my work  excite  horror  suspicion   peasants  i accordingly put them into  basket   great quantity  stones  laying them up determined  throw them into  sea  very night    meantime i sat upon  beach employed  cleaning  arranging my chemical apparatus nothing could  more complete than  alteration  had taken place  my feelings since  night   appearance   dæmon i had before regarded my promise   gloomy despair   thing that  whatever consequences must  fulfilled but i now felt  if  film had been taken  before my eyes   i   first time saw clearly the idea  renewing my labours did not  one instant occur  me  threat i had heard weighed  my thoughts but i did not reflect   voluntary act  mine could avert it i had resolved  my own mind   create another like  fiend i had first made would   act   basest  most atrocious selfishness  i banished  my mind every thought  could lead   different conclusion between two  three   morning  moon rose  i then putting my basket aboard  little skiff sailed out about four miles   shore the scene  perfectly solitary  few boats  returning towards land but i sailed away  them i felt  if i  about  commission   dreadful crime  avoided  shuddering anxiety any encounter  my fellow creatures at one time  moon which had before been clear  suddenly overspread   thick cloud  i took advantage   moment  darkness  cast my basket into  sea i listened   gurgling sound   sank  then sailed away   spot the sky became clouded but  air  pure although chilled   northeast breeze   then rising but  refreshed me  filled me  such agreeable sensations  i resolved  prolong my stay   water  fixing  rudder   direct position stretched myself   bottom   boat clouds hid  moon everything  obscure  i heard only  sound   boat   keel cut through  waves  murmur lulled me    short time i slept soundly i do not know how long i remained  this situation but when i awoke i found   sun had already mounted considerably the wind  high   waves continually threatened  safety  my little skiff i found   wind  northeast  must have driven me far   coast  which i had embarked i endeavoured  change my course but quickly found  if i again made  attempt  boat would  instantly filled  water thus situated my only resource   drive before  wind i confess  i felt  few sensations  terror i had no compass  me   so slenderly acquainted   geography  this part   world   sun   little benefit  me i might  driven into  wide atlantic  feel all  tortures  starvation or  swallowed up   immeasurable waters  roared  buffeted around me i had already been out many hours  felt  torment   burning thirst  prelude  my other sufferings i looked   heavens which  covered  clouds  flew before  wind only   replaced  others i looked upon  sea     my grave “fiend” i exclaimed “your task  already fulfilled” i thought  elizabeth  my father   clerval—all left behind  whom  monster might satisfy his sanguinary  merciless passions this idea plunged me into  reverie so despairing  frightful  even now when  scene    point  closing before me  ever i shudder  reflect  it some hours passed thus but  degrees   sun declined towards  horizon  wind died away into  gentle breeze   sea became free  breakers but these gave place   heavy swell i felt sick  hardly able  hold  rudder when suddenly i saw  line  high land towards  south almost spent  i was  fatigue   dreadful suspense i endured  several hours this sudden certainty  life rushed like  flood  warm joy  my heart  tears gushed  my eyes how mutable  our feelings  how strange   clinging love we have  life even   excess  misery i constructed another sail   part  my dress  eagerly steered my course towards  land it had  wild  rocky appearance but  i approached nearer i easily perceived  traces  cultivation i saw vessels near  shore  found myself suddenly transported back   neighbourhood  civilised man i carefully traced  windings   land  hailed  steeple which i  length saw issuing  behind  small promontory as i    state  extreme debility i resolved  sail directly towards  town   place where i could most easily procure nourishment fortunately i had money  me as i turned  promontory i perceived  small neat town   good harbour which i entered my heart bounding  joy  my unexpected escape as i  occupied  fixing  boat  arranging  sails several people crowded towards  spot they seemed much surprised  my appearance but instead  offering me any assistance whispered together  gestures   any other time might have produced  me  slight sensation  alarm as  was i merely remarked  they spoke english  i therefore addressed them   language “my good friends” said i “will you  so kind   tell me  name  this town  inform me where i am” “you  know  soon enough” replied  man   hoarse voice “maybe you  come   place   not prove much  your taste but you  not  consulted   your quarters i promise you” i  exceedingly surprised  receiving so rude  answer   stranger  i  also disconcerted  perceiving  frowning  angry countenances  his companions “why do you answer me so roughly” i replied “surely   not  custom  englishmen  receive strangers so inhospitably” “i do not know” said  man “what  custom   english may be but    custom   irish  hate villains” while this strange dialogue continued i perceived  crowd rapidly increase their faces expressed  mixture  curiosity  anger which annoyed   some degree alarmed me i inquired  way   inn but no one replied i then moved forward   murmuring sound arose   crowd  they followed  surrounded me when  illlooking man approaching tapped me   shoulder  said “come sir you must follow me  mr kirwin’s  give  account  yourself” “who  mr kirwin why am i  give  account  myself is not this  free country” “ay sir free enough  honest folks mr kirwin   magistrate  you   give  account   death   gentleman who  found murdered here last night” this answer startled me but i presently recovered myself i  innocent  could easily  proved accordingly i followed my conductor  silence   led  one   best houses   town i  ready  sink  fatigue  hunger but being surrounded   crowd i thought  politic  rouse all my strength  no physical debility might  construed into apprehension or conscious guilt little did i then expect  calamity     few moments  overwhelm me  extinguish  horror  despair all fear  ignominy or death i must pause here   requires all my fortitude  recall  memory   frightful events which i am about  relate  proper detail  my recollection chapter  i  soon introduced into  presence   magistrate  old benevolent man  calm  mild manners he looked upon me however  some degree  severity  then turning towards my conductors  asked who appeared  witnesses  this occasion about half  dozen men came forward and one being selected   magistrate  deposed   had been out fishing  night before  his son  brotherinlaw daniel nugent when about ten o’clock they observed  strong northerly blast rising  they accordingly put   port it   very dark night   moon had not yet risen they did not land   harbour but  they had been accustomed   creek about two miles below he walked  first carrying  part   fishing tackle  his companions followed him  some distance as   proceeding along  sands  struck his foot against something  fell  his length   ground his companions came up  assist him    light  their lantern they found   had fallen   body   man who   all appearance dead their first supposition      corpse  some person who had been drowned   thrown  shore   waves but  examination they found   clothes  not wet  even   body  not then cold they instantly carried    cottage   old woman near  spot  endeavoured but  vain  restore   life it appeared    handsome young man about five  twenty years  age he had apparently been strangled  there  no sign  any violence except  black mark  fingers  his neck the first part  this deposition did not   least interest me but when  mark   fingers  mentioned i remembered  murder  my brother  felt myself extremely agitated my limbs trembled   mist came over my eyes which obliged me  lean   chair  support the magistrate observed me   keen eye   course drew  unfavourable augury  my manner the son confirmed his father’s account but when daniel nugent  called  swore positively  just before  fall  his companion  saw  boat   single man  it   short distance   shore   far   could judge   light   few stars    same boat  which i had just landed a woman deposed  she lived near  beach   standing   door  her cottage waiting   return   fishermen about  hour before she heard   discovery   body when she saw  boat  only one man   push off   part   shore where  corpse  afterwards found another woman confirmed  account   fishermen having brought  body into her house   not cold they put  into  bed  rubbed it  daniel went   town   apothecary but life  quite gone several other men  examined concerning my landing  they agreed that   strong north wind  had arisen during  night   very probable  i had beaten about  many hours  had been obliged  return nearly   same spot  which i had departed besides they observed   appeared  i had brought  body  another place    likely   i did not appear  know  shore i might have put into  harbour ignorant   distance   town  ——   place where i had deposited  corpse mr kirwin  hearing this evidence desired  i should  taken into  room where  body lay  interment   might  observed what effect  sight   would produce upon me this idea  probably suggested   extreme agitation i had exhibited when  mode   murder had been described i  accordingly conducted   magistrate  several other persons   inn i could not help being struck   strange coincidences  had taken place during this eventful night but knowing  i had been conversing  several persons   island i had inhabited about  time   body had been found i  perfectly tranquil    consequences   affair i entered  room where  corpse lay   led up   coffin how can i describe my sensations  beholding it i feel yet parched  horror nor can i reflect   terrible moment without shuddering  agony the examination  presence   magistrate  witnesses passed like  dream  my memory when i saw  lifeless form  henry clerval stretched before me i gasped  breath  throwing myself   body i exclaimed “have my murderous machinations deprived you also my dearest henry  life two i have already destroyed other victims await their destiny but you clerval my friend my benefactor—” the human frame could no longer support  agonies  i endured  i  carried out   room  strong convulsions a fever succeeded  this i lay  two months   point  death my ravings  i afterwards heard  frightful i called myself  murderer  william  justine   clerval sometimes i entreated my attendants  assist me   destruction   fiend  whom i  tormented   others i felt  fingers   monster already grasping my neck  screamed aloud  agony  terror fortunately  i spoke my native language mr kirwin alone understood me but my gestures  bitter cries  sufficient  affright  other witnesses why did i not die more miserable than man ever  before why did i not sink into forgetfulness  rest death snatches away many blooming children  only hopes  their doting parents how many brides  youthful lovers have been one day   bloom  health  hope   next  prey  worms   decay   tomb of what materials  i made  i could thus resist so many shocks which like  turning   wheel continually renewed  torture but i  doomed  live   two months found myself  awaking   dream   prison stretched   wretched bed surrounded  gaolers turnkeys bolts  all  miserable apparatus   dungeon it  morning i remember when i thus awoke  understanding i had forgotten  particulars  what had happened  only felt  if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me but when i looked around  saw  barred windows   squalidness   room  which i was all flashed across my memory  i groaned bitterly this sound disturbed  old woman who  sleeping   chair beside me she   hired nurse  wife  one   turnkeys  her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise  class the lines  her face  hard  rude like   persons accustomed  see without sympathising  sights  misery her tone expressed her entire indifference she addressed me  english   voice struck me  one  i had heard during my sufferings “are you better now sir” said she i replied   same language   feeble voice “i believe i am but if   all true if indeed i did not dream i am sorry  i am still alive  feel this misery  horror” “for  matter” replied  old woman “if you mean about  gentleman you murdered i believe    better  you if you  dead  i fancy   go hard  you however that’s none  my business i am sent  nurse you  get you well i do my duty   safe conscience   well if everybody did  same” i turned  loathing   woman who could utter so unfeeling  speech   person just saved   very edge  death but i felt languid  unable  reflect  all  had passed the whole series  my life appeared  me   dream i sometimes doubted if indeed   all true   never presented itself  my mind   force  reality as  images  floated before me became more distinct i grew feverish  darkness pressed around me no one  near me who soothed me   gentle voice  love no dear hand supported me the physician came  prescribed medicines   old woman prepared them  me but utter carelessness  visible   first   expression  brutality  strongly marked   visage   second who could  interested   fate   murderer but  hangman who would gain his fee these  my first reflections but i soon learned  mr kirwin had shown me extreme

 explanation   others  appeared  consider    offspring  delirium  that during my illness some idea  this kind had presented itself  my imagination  remembrance  which i preserved  my convalescence i avoided explanation  maintained  continual silence concerning  wretch i had created i had  persuasion  i should  supposed mad  this  itself would  ever have chained my tongue but besides i could not

instantly changed  subject  our conversation  endeavoured  alter  course  my thoughts he wished  much  possible  obliterate  memory   scenes  had taken place  ireland  never alluded  them or suffered me  speak  my misfortunes as time passed away i became more calm misery had her dwelling  my heart but i no longer talked   same incoherent manner  my own crimes sufficient  me   consciousness  them by  utmost selfviolence i curbed  imperious voice  wretchedness which sometimes desired  declare itself   whole world  my manners  calmer  more composed than they had ever been since my journey   sea  ice a few days before we left paris  our way  switzerland i received  following letter  elizabeth “my dear friend “it gave me  greatest pleasure  receive  letter  my uncle dated  paris you  no longer

made you so miserable  year ago even perhaps augmented  time i would not disturb you  this period when so many misfortunes weigh upon you but  conversation  i had  my uncle previous  his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet explanation you may possibly say what can elizabeth have  explain if you really say this my questions  answered  all my doubts satisfied but you  distant  me    possible  you may dread  yet  pleased  this explanation    probability  this being  case i dare not any longer postpone writing what during your absence i have often wished  express

employ every art  destroy me  tear me   glimpse  happiness which promised partly  console my sufferings on  night  had determined  consummate his crimes  my death well   so  deadly struggle would then assuredly take place  which if   victorious i should   peace  his power over me    end if   vanquished i should   free man alas what freedom such   peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes his cottage burnt his lands laid waste    turned adrift homeless penniless  alone but free such would  my liberty except   my elizabeth i possessed  treasure alas balanced  those horrors  remorse  guilt which would pursue me until death sweet  beloved elizabeth i read  reread her letter  some softened feelings stole into my heart  dared  whisper paradisiacal dreams  love  joy but  apple  already eaten   angel’s arm bared  drive me  all hope yet i would die  make her happy if  monster executed his threat death  inevitable yet again i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate my destruction might indeed arrive  few months sooner but if my torturer should suspect  i postponed it influenced  his menaces  would surely find other  perhaps more dreadful means  revenge he had vowed to   me  my weddingnight yet  did not consider  threat  binding him  peace   meantime   if  show me    not yet satiated  blood  had murdered clerval immediately after  enunciation  his threats i resolved therefore  if my immediate union  my cousin would conduce either  hers or my father’s happiness my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard   single hour in this state  mind i wrote  elizabeth my letter  calm  affectionate “i fear my beloved girl” i said “little happiness remains  us  earth yet all  i may one day enjoy  centred  you chase away your idle fears  you alone do i consecrate my life  my endeavours  contentment i have one secret elizabeth  dreadful one when revealed  you   chill your frame  horror  then far  being surprised  my misery you  only wonder  i survive what i have endured i  confide this tale  misery  terror  you  day after our marriage shall take place for my sweet cousin there must  perfect confidence between us but until then i conjure you do not mention or allude  it this i most earnestly entreat  i know you  comply” in about  week after  arrival  elizabeth’s letter we returned  geneva the sweet girl welcomed me  warm affection yet tears   her eyes  she beheld my emaciated frame  feverish cheeks i saw  change  her also she  thinner  had lost much   heavenly vivacity  had before charmed me but her gentleness  soft looks  compassion made her  more fit companion  one blasted  miserable  i was the tranquillity which i now enjoyed did not endure memory brought madness  it  when i thought  what had passed  real insanity possessed me sometimes i  furious  burnt  rage sometimes low  despondent i neither spoke nor looked  anyone but sat motionless bewildered   multitude  miseries  overcame me elizabeth alone had  power  draw me  these fits her gentle voice would soothe me when transported  passion  inspire me  human feelings when sunk  torpor she wept  me   me when reason returned she would remonstrate  endeavour  inspire me  resignation ah it  well   unfortunate   resigned but   guilty there  no peace the agonies  remorse poison  luxury there  otherwise sometimes found  indulging  excess  grief soon after my arrival my father spoke  my immediate marriage  elizabeth i remained silent “have you then some other attachment” “none  earth i love elizabeth  look forward  our union  delight let  day therefore  fixed    i  consecrate myself  life or death   happiness  my cousin” “my dear victor do not speak thus heavy misfortunes have befallen us but let us only cling closer  what remains  transfer our love  those whom we have lost  those who yet live our circle   small but bound close   ties  affection  mutual misfortune and when time shall have softened your despair new  dear objects  care   born  replace those  whom we have been so cruelly deprived” such   lessons  my father but  me  remembrance   threat returned nor can you wonder that omnipotent   fiend had yet been  his deeds  blood i should almost regard him  invincible   when  had pronounced  words “i shall   you  your weddingnight” i should regard  threatened fate  unavoidable but death  no evil  me if  loss  elizabeth  balanced  it  i therefore   contented  even cheerful countenance agreed  my father  if my cousin would consent  ceremony should take place  ten days  thus put  i imagined  seal  my fate great god if  one instant i had thought what might   hellish intention  my fiendish adversary i would rather have banished myself  ever  my native country  wandered  friendless outcast over  earth than have consented  this miserable marriage but  if possessed  magic powers  monster had blinded me  his real intentions  when i thought  i had prepared only my own death i hastened    far dearer victim as

 anxious  watchful while my right hand grasped  pistol which  hidden  my bosom every sound terrified me but i resolved  i would sell my life dearly  not shrink   conflict until my own life or   my

never deviating into invective or exclamation the magistrate appeared  first perfectly incredulous but  i continued  became more attentive  interested i saw him sometimes shudder  horror  others  lively surprise unmingled  disbelief  painted  his countenance when i had concluded my narration i said “this   being whom i accuse   whose seizure  punishment i call upon you  exert your whole power

possessed me  i concluded  rage choked my utterance i  answered through  stillness  night   loud  fiendish laugh it rang  my ears long  heavily  mountains reechoed it  i felt  if all hell surrounded

abhorred voice apparently close  my ear addressed me   audible whisper “i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined  live  i am satisfied” i darted towards  spot  which  sound proceeded but  devil eluded my grasp suddenly  broad disk   moon arose  shone full upon his ghastly  distorted shape   fled  more than mortal speed i pursued him   many months this  been my task guided   slight clue i followed  windings   rhone but vainly the blue mediterranean appeared    strange chance i saw  fiend enter  night  hide himself   vessel bound   black sea i took my passage   same ship but  escaped i know not how amidst  wilds  tartary  russia although  still evaded me i have ever followed  his track sometimes  peasants scared  this horrid apparition informed me  his path sometimes  himself who feared  if i lost all trace  him i should despair  die left some mark  guide me the snows descended  my head  i saw  print  his huge step   white plain to you first entering  life  whom care  new

cloudless  i  parched  thirst  slight cloud would bedim  sky shed  few drops  revived me  vanish i followed when i could  courses   rivers but  dæmon generally avoided these    here   population   country chiefly collected in other places human beings  seldom seen  i generally subsisted   wild animals  crossed my path i had money  me  gained  friendship   villagers  distributing it or i brought  me some food  i had killed which after taking  small part i always presented  those who had provided me  fire  utensils  cooking my life   passed thus  indeed hateful  me    during sleep alone  i could taste joy o blessed sleep often when most miserable i sank  repose  my dreams lulled me even  rapture the spirits  guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours  happiness  i might

waking hours  persuade myself  they still lived at such moments vengeance  burned within me died  my heart  i pursued my path towards  destruction   dæmon more   task enjoined  heaven   mechanical impulse  some power  which i  unconscious than   ardent desire  my soul what his feelings  whom i pursued i cannot know sometimes indeed  left marks  writing   barks   trees or cut  stone  guided me  instigated my fury “my reign  not yet over”—these words  legible  one  these inscriptions—“you live  my power  complete follow me i seek  everlasting ices   north where you  feel  misery  cold  frost

join my elizabeth  my departed friends who even now prepare  me  reward  my tedious toil  horrible pilgrimage as i still pursued my journey   northward  snows thickened   cold increased   degree almost too severe  support the peasants  shut up  their hovels  only  few   most hardy ventured forth  seize  animals whom starvation had forced  their hidingplaces  seek  prey the rivers  covered

i had procured  sledge  dogs  thus traversed  snows  inconceivable speed i know not whether  fiend possessed  same advantages but i found that  before i had daily lost ground   pursuit i now gained  him so much so  when i first saw  ocean   but one day’s journey  advance  i hoped  intercept him before  should reach  beach with new courage therefore i pressed on   two days arrived   wretched

after  slight repose during which  spirits   dead hovered round  instigated me  toil  revenge i prepared  my journey i exchanged my landsledge  one fashioned   inequalities   frozen ocean  purchasing  plentiful stock  provisions i departed  land i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but  eternal sentiment   just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me  support immense  rugged mountains  ice often barred up my passage  i often heard  thunder   ground sea which threatened my destruction but again  frost came  made  paths   sea secure by  quantity  provision which i had consumed i should guess  i had passed three weeks  this journey   continual protraction  hope returning back upon  heart often wrung bitter drops

dead companion gave them  plentiful portion  food  after  hour’s rest which  absolutely necessary  yet which  bitterly irksome  me i continued my route the sledge  still visible nor did i again lose sight   except   moments when   short time some icerock concealed    intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained  it  when after nearly two days’ journey i beheld my enemy  no more than  mile distant my heart bounded within me but now when i appeared almost within grasp  my foe my hopes  suddenly extinguished  i lost all trace  him more utterly than i had ever done before a ground sea

passed  such uncommon interest that although   highly probable  these papers may never reach you yet i cannot forbear recording it we  still surrounded  mountains  ice still  imminent danger  being crushed  their conflict the cold  excessive  many  my unfortunate comrades have already found  grave amidst this scene  desolation frankenstein  daily declined  health  feverish fire still glimmers  his eyes but   exhausted  when suddenly roused  any exertion  speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness i mentioned  my last letter  fears i entertained   mutiny this morning  i sat watching  wan countenance  my friend—his eyes half closed  his limbs hanging listlessly—i  roused  half  dozen   sailors who demanded admission into  cabin they entered  their leader addressed me he told me    his companions had been chosen   other sailors  come  deputation  me  make me  requisition which  justice i could not refuse we  immured  ice  should probably never escape but they feared  if   possible  ice should dissipate   free passage  opened i should  rash enough  continue my voyage  lead them into fresh dangers after they might happily have surmounted this they insisted therefore  i should engage   solemn promise  if  vessel should  freed i would instantly direct my course southwards this speech troubled me i had not despaired nor had i yet conceived  idea  returning if set free yet could i  justice or even  possibility refuse this demand i hesitated before i answered when frankenstein who had  first been silent  indeed appeared hardly  have force enough  attend now roused himself his eyes sparkled  his cheeks flushed  momentary vigour turning towards  men  said “what do you mean what do you demand  your captain are you then so easily turned  your design did you not call this  glorious expedition “and wherefore   glorious not because  way  smooth  placid   southern sea but because   full  dangers  terror because  every new incident your fortitude    called forth

spoke i told them  retire  consider  what had been said  i would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired  contrary but  i hoped that  reflection their courage would return they retired  i turned towards my friend but   sunk  languor  almost deprived  life how all this  terminate i know not but i had rather die than return shamefully my purpose unfulfilled yet i fear such   my fate

when  sailors saw this   their return  their native country  apparently assured  shout  tumultuous joy broke  them loud  longcontinued frankenstein who  dozing awoke  asked  cause   tumult “they

i  not you may give up your purpose but mine  assigned  me  heaven  i dare not i am weak but surely  spirits who assist my vengeance  endow me  sufficient strength” saying this  endeavoured  spring

gave him  composing draught  ordered us  leave him undisturbed in  meantime  told me  my friend had certainly not many hours  live his sentence  pronounced  i could only grieve   patient i sat  his

incomplete without this final  wonderful catastrophe i entered  cabin where lay  remains  my illfated  admirable friend over him hung  form which i cannot find words  describe—gigantic  stature yet uncouth  distorted   proportions as  hung over  coffin his face  concealed  long locks  ragged hair but one vast hand  extended  colour  apparent texture like    mummy when  heard  sound  my approach  ceased  utter exclamations  grief  horror  sprung towards  window never did i behold  vision so horrible  his face  such loathsome yet appalling hideousness i shut my eyes involuntarily  endeavoured  recollect what  my duties  regard  this destroyer i called  him  stay he paused looking  me  wonder  again turning towards  lifeless form  his creator  seemed  forget my presence  every feature  gesture seemed instigated   wildest rage  some uncontrollable passion “that  also my victim”  exclaimed “in his murder my crimes  consummated  miserable series  my being  wound   close oh frankenstein generous  selfdevoted being what does  avail  i now ask thee  pardon me i who irretrievably destroyed thee  destroying all thou lovedst alas he  cold  cannot answer me” his voice seemed suffocated  my first impulses which had suggested  me  duty  obeying  dying request  my friend  destroying his enemy  now suspended   mixture  curiosity  compassion i approached this tremendous being i dared not again raise my eyes  his face there  something so scaring  unearthly  his ugliness i attempted  speak but  words died away  my lips the monster continued  utter wild  incoherent selfreproaches at

unspeakable torments dared  hope  happiness  while  accumulated wretchedness  despair upon me  sought his own enjoyment  feelings  passions   indulgence  which i   ever barred then impotent envy  bitter indignation filled me   insatiable thirst  vengeance i recollected my threat  resolved   should  accomplished i knew  i  preparing  myself  deadly torture but i   slave not  master   impulse which i detested yet could not disobey yet when she died nay then i  not miserable i had cast off all feeling subdued all anguish  riot   excess  my despair evil thenceforth became my good urged thus far i had no choice but  adapt my nature   element which i had willingly chosen the completion  my demoniacal design became  insatiable passion and now   ended there  my last victim” i   first touched

“wretch” i said “it  well  you come here  whine over  desolation  you have made you throw  torch into  pile  buildings  when they  consumed you sit among  ruins  lament  fall hypocritical fiend if  whom you mourn still lived still would    object again would  become  prey  your accursed vengeance it  not pity  you feel you lament only because  victim  your malignity  withdrawn  your power” “oh

friends  associates  his desolation i am alone “you who call frankenstein your friend seem  have  knowledge  my crimes  his misfortunes but   detail which  gave you  them  could not sum up  hours  months  misery which i endured wasting  impotent passions for while i destroyed his hopes i did not satisfy my own desires they   ever ardent  craving still i desired love  fellowship  i  still spurned was there no injustice  this am i   thought  only criminal when all humankind sinned against me why do you not hate felix who drove his friend  his door  contumely why do you not execrate  rustic who sought  destroy  saviour  his child nay these  virtuous  immaculate beings i  miserable   abandoned am  abortion   spurned at  kicked  trampled on even now my blood boils   recollection

warmth  summer  heard  rustling   leaves   warbling   birds  these  all  me i should have wept  die now   my only consolation polluted  crimes  torn   bitterest remorse where can i find rest but  death “farewell i leave you   you  last  humankind whom these eyes  ever behold farewell frankenstein if thou wert yet alive  yet cherished  desire  revenge against me  would  better satiated  my life than  my destruction but   not so thou didst seek my extinction  i might not cause greater wretchedness  if yet  some mode unknown  me thou hadst not ceased  think  feel thou wouldst not desire against me  vengeance greater than  which i feel blasted  thou wert my agony  still superior  thine   bitter sting  remorse  not cease  rankle  my wounds until death shall close them  ever “but soon”
