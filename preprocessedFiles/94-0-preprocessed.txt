willa cather alexander’s bridge  willa cather chapter i late one brilliant april afternoon professor lucius wilson stood   head  chestnut street looking about him   pleased air   man  taste who does not very often get  boston he had lived there   student but  twenty years  more since  had been professor  philosophy   western university  had seldom come east except  take  steamer  some foreign port wilson  standing quite still contemplating   whimsical smile  slanting street   worn paving  irregular gravely colored houses   row  naked trees  which  thin sunlight  still shining the gleam   river   foot   hill made him blink  little not so much because   too bright  because  found  so pleasant the few passersby glanced  him unconcernedly  even  children who hurried along  their schoolbags under their arms seemed  find  perfectly natural   tall brown gentleman should  standing there looking up through his glasses   gray housetops the sun sank rapidly  silvery light had faded   bare boughs   watery twilight  setting  when wilson  last walked down  hill descending into cooler  cooler depths  grayish shadow his nostril long unused  it  quick  detect  smell  wood smoke   air blended   odor  moist spring earth   saltiness  came up  river   tide he crossed charles street between jangling street cars  shelving lumber drays  after  moment  uncertainty wound into brimmer street the street  quiet deserted  hung   thin bluish haze he had already fixed his sharp eye upon  house which  reasoned should  his objective point when  noticed  woman approaching rapidly   opposite direction always  interested observer  women wilson would have slackened his pace anywhere  follow this one  his impersonal appreciative glance she   person  distinction  saw  once and moreover very handsome she  tall carried her beautiful head proudly  moved  ease  certainty one immediately took  granted  costly privileges  fine spaces  must lie   background  which such  figure could emerge  this rapid  elegant gait wilson noted her dress toofor  his way  had  eye  such thingsparticularly her brown furs  her hat he got  blurred impression  her fine color  violets she wore her white gloves and curiously enough  her veil  she turned up  flight  steps  front  him  disappeared wilson  able  enjoy lovely things  passed him   wing  completely  deliberately  if they had been dugup marvels long anticipated  definitely fixed   end   railway journey for  few pleasurable seconds  quite forgot where   going  only after  door had closed behind her did  realize   young woman had entered  house  which  had directed his trunk   south station  morning he hesitated  moment before mounting  steps “can that”  murmured  amazement“can  possibly have been mrs alexander” when  servant admitted him mrs alexander  still standing   hallway she heard him give his name  came forward holding out her hand “is  you indeed professor wilson i  afraid  you might get here before i did i  detained   concert  bartley telephoned   would  late thomas  show you your room had you rather have your tea brought  you there or  you have  down here  me while we wait  bartley” wilson  pleased  find   had been  cause  her rapid walk   her   even more vastly pleased than before he followed her through  drawingroom into  library where  wide back windows looked out upon  garden   sunset   fine stretch  silvercolored river a harpshaped elm stood stripped against  palecolored evening sky  ragged last year’s birds’ nests   forks  through  bare branches  evening star quivered   misty air the long brown room breathed  peace   rich  amply guarded quiet tea  brought  immediately  placed  front   wood fire mrs alexander sat down   highbacked chair  began  pour it while wilson sank into  low seat opposite her  took his cup   great sense  ease  harmony  comfort “you have had  long journey haven’t you” mrs alexander asked after showing gracious concern about his tea “and i am so sorry bartley  late he’s often tired when he’s late he flatters himself     little  his account  you have come  this congress  psychologists” “it is” wilson assented selecting his muffin carefully “and i hope  won’t  tired tonight but  my own account i’m glad  have  few moments alone  you before bartley comes i  somehow afraid  my knowing him so well would not put me   way  getting  know you” “that’s very nice  you” she nodded  him above her cup  smiled but there   little formal tightness  her tone which had not been there when she greeted him   hall wilson leaned forward “have i said something awkward i live very far out   world you know but i didn’t mean  you would exactly fade dim even if bartley  here” mrs alexander laughed relentingly “oh i’m not so vain how terribly discerning you are” she looked straight  wilson   felt  this quick frank glance brought about  understanding between them he liked everything about her  told himself but  particularly liked her eyes when she looked  one directly   moment they  like  glimpse  fine windy sky  may bring all sorts  weather “since you noticed something” mrs alexander went on “it must have been  flash   distrust i have come  feel whenever i meet any   people who knew bartley when    boy it  always  if they  talking  someone i had never met really professor wilson  would seem   grew up among  strangest people they usually say    turned out very well or remark   always   fine fellow i never know what reply  make” wilson chuckled  leaned back  his chair shaking his left foot gently “i expect  fact   we none  us knew him very well mrs alexander though i  say  myself  i  always confident he’d do something extraordinary” mrs alexander’s shoulders gave  slight movement suggestive  impatience “oh i should think  might have been  safe prediction another cup please” “yes thank you but predicting   case  boys  not so easy  you might imagine mrs alexander some get  bad hurt early  lose their courage  some never get  fair wind bartley”he dropped his chin   back  his long hand  looked  her admiringly“bartley caught  wind early    sung  his sails ever since” mrs alexander sat looking into  fire  intent preoccupation  wilson studied her halfaverted face he liked  suggestion  stormy possibilities   proud curve  her lip  nostril without that  reflected she would  too cold “i should like  know what   really like when    boy i don’t believe  remembers” she said suddenly “won’t you smoke mr wilson” wilson lit  cigarette “no i don’t suppose  does he  never introspective he  simply  most tremendous response  stimuli i have ever known we didn’t know exactly what  do  him” a servant came   noiselessly removed  teatray mrs alexander screened her face   firelight which  beginning  throw wavering bright spots  her dress  hair   dusk deepened “of course” she said “i now  again hear stories about things  happened when    college” “but  isn’t what you want” wilson wrinkled his brows  looked  her   smiling familiarity  had come about so quickly “what you want   picture  him standing back there   other end  twenty years you want  look down through my memory” she dropped her hands  her lap “yes yes that’s exactly what i want” at this moment they heard  front door shut   jar  wilson laughed  mrs alexander rose quickly “there  is away  perspective no past no future  bartley just  fiery moment the only moment  ever  or     world” the door   hall opened  voice called “winifred” hurriedly   big man came through  drawingroom   quick heavy tread bringing  him  smell  cigar smoke  chill outofdoors air when alexander reached  library door  switched   lights  stood six feet  more   archway glowing  strength  cordiality  rugged blond good looks there  other bridgebuilders   world certainly but   always alexander’s picture   sunday supplement men wanted because  looked   tamer  rivers ought  look under his tumbled sandy hair his head seemed  hard  powerful   catapult  his shoulders looked strong enough  themselves  support  span  any one  his ten great bridges  cut  air above  many rivers after dinner alexander took wilson up  his study it   large room over  library  looked out upon  black river   row  white lights along  cambridge embankment the room  not  all what one might expect   engineer’s study wilson felt  once  harmony  beautiful things  have lived long together without obtrusions  ugliness or change it  none  alexander’s doing  course those warm consonances  color had been blending  mellowing before   born but  wonder     not out  place therethat  all seemed  glow like  inevitable background  his vigor  vehemence he sat before  fire his shoulders deep   cushions  his chair his powerful head upright his hair rumpled above his broad forehead he sat heavily  cigar  his large smooth hand  flush  afterdinner color  his face which wind  sun  exposure  all sorts  weather had left fair  clearskinned “you  off  england  saturday bartley mrs alexander tells me” “yes   few weeks only there’s  meeting  british engineers  i’m doing another bridge  canada you know” “oh every one knows about that and    canada  you met your wife wasn’t it” “yes  allway she  visiting her greataunt there a most remarkable old lady i  working  mackeller then  old scotch engineer who had picked me up  london  taken me back  quebec  him he had  contract   allway bridge but before  began work    found out    going  die   advised  committee  turn  job over  me otherwise i’d never have got anything good so early mackeller   old friend  mrs pemberton winifred’s aunt he had mentioned me  her so when i went  allway she asked me  come  see her she   wonderful old lady” “like her niece” wilson queried bartley laughed “she had been very handsome but not  winifred’s way when i knew her she  little  fragile very pink  white   splendid head   face like fine old lace somehowbut perhaps i always think   because she wore  lace scarf  her hair she had such  flavor  life about her she had known gordon  livingstone  beaconsfield when she  youngevery one she   first woman   sort i’d ever known you know how     westold people  poked out   way aunt eleanor fascinated me  few young women have ever done i used  go up   works  have tea  her  sit talking  her  hours it  very stimulating  she couldn’t tolerate stupidity” “it must have been then  your luck began bartley” said wilson flicking his cigar ash  his long finger “it’s curious watching boys”  went  reflectively “i’m sure i did you justice   matter  ability yet i always used  feel  there   weak spot where some day strain would tell even after you began  climb i stood down   crowd  watched you withwell not  confidence the more dazzling  front you presented  higher your facade rose  more i expected  see  big crack zigzagging  top  bottom”he indicated  course   air  his forefinger“then  crash  clouds  dust it  curious i had such  clear picture  it and another curious thing bartley” wilson spoke  deliberateness  settled deeper into his chair “is  i don’t feel  any longer i am sure  you” alexander laughed “nonsense it’s not i you feel sure of it’s winifred people often make  mistake” “no i’m serious alexander you’ve changed you have decided  leave some birds   bushes you used  want them all” alexander’s chair creaked “i still want  good many”  said rather gloomily “after all life doesn’t offer  man much you work like  devil  think you’re getting on  suddenly you discover  you’ve only been getting yourself tied up a million details drink you dry your life keeps going  things you don’t want  all  while you  being built alive into  social structure you don’t care  rap about i sometimes wonder what sort  chap i’d have been if i hadn’t been this sort i want  go  live out his potentialities too i haven’t forgotten  there  birds   bushes” bartley stopped  sat frowning into  fire his shoulders thrust forward  if   about  spring  something wilson watched him wondering his old pupil always stimulated him  first  then vastly wearied him the machinery  always pounding away  this man  wilson preferred companions   more reflective habit  mind he could not help feeling  there  unreasoning  unreasonable activities going   alexander all  while  even after dinner when most men achieve  decent impersonality bartley had merely closed  door   engineroom  come up   airing the machinery itself  still pounding on bartley’s abstraction  wilson’s reflections  cut short   rustle   door  almost before they could rise mrs alexander  standing   hearth alexander brought  chair  her but she shook her head “no dear thank you i only came   see whether you  professor wilson  quite comfortable i am going down   musicroom” “why not practice here wilson  i  growing very dull we  tired  talk” “yes i beg you mrs alexander” wilson began but  got no further “why certainly if you won’t find me too noisy i am working   schumann carnival’ and though i don’t practice  great many hours i am very methodical” mrs alexander explained  she crossed   upright piano  stood   back   room near  windows wilson followed and having seen her seated dropped into  chair behind her she played brilliantly   great musical feeling wilson could not imagine her permitting herself  do anything badly but   surprised   cleanness  her execution he wondered how  woman  so many duties had managed  keep herself up   standard really professional it must take  great deal  time certainly  bartley must take  great deal  time wilson reflected   had never before known  woman who had been able  any considerable while  support both  personal   intellectual passion sitting behind her  watched her  perplexed admiration shading his eyes  his hand in her dinner dress she looked even younger than  street clothes and  all her composure  selfsufficiency she seemed  him strangely alert  vibrating  if  her too there  something never altogether  rest he felt   knew pretty much what she demanded  people  what she demanded  life   wondered how she squared bartley after ten years she must know him  however one took him however much one admired him one had  admit   simply wouldn’t square he   natural force certainly but beyond that wilson felt   not anything very really or  very long   time wilson glanced toward  fire where bartley’s profile  still wreathed  cigar smoke  curled up more  more slowly his shoulders  sunk deep   cushions  one hand hung large  passive over  arm  his chair he had slipped   purple velvet smokingcoat his wife wilson surmised had chosen it she  clearly very proud  his good looks  his fine color but   glow   immediate interest gone out  it  engineer’s face looked tired even  little haggard the three lines  his forehead directly above  nose deepened   sat thinking  his powerful head drooped forward heavily although alexander  only fortythree wilson thought  beneath his vigorous color  detected  dulling weariness  oncoming middle age the next afternoon   hour when  river  beginning  redden under  declining sun wilson again found himself facing mrs alexander   teatable   library “well”  remarked when   bidden  give  account  himself “there   long morning   psychologists luncheon  bartley  his club more psychologists  here i am i’ve looked forward  this hour all day” mrs alexander smiled  him across  vapor   kettle “and do you remember where we stopped yesterday” “perfectly i  going  show you  picture but i doubt whether i have color enough  me bartley makes me feel  faded monochrome you can’t get   young bartley except  means  color” wilson paused  deliberated suddenly  broke out “he wasn’t  remarkable student you know though   always strong  higher mathematics his work  my own department  quite ordinary it    powerfully equipped nature  i found him interesting that   most interesting thing  teacher can find it   fascination   scientific discovery we come across other pleasing  endearing qualities so much oftener than we find force” “and after all” said mrs alexander “that   thing we all live upon it   thing  takes us forward” wilson thought she spoke  little wistfully “exactly”  assented warmly “it builds  bridges into  future over which  feet  every one  us  go” “how interested i am  hear you put    way the bridges into  futurei often say   myself bartley’s bridges always seem  me like that have you ever seen his first suspension bridge  canada  one   doing when i first knew him i hope you  see  sometime we  married  soon    finished  you  laugh when i tell you   always   rather bridal look  me it  over  wildest river  mists  clouds always battling about it     delicate   cobweb hanging   sky it really   bridge into  future you have only  look    feel   meant  beginning   great career but i have  photograph   here” she drew  portfolio  behind  bookcase “and there you see   hill  my aunt’s house” wilson took up  photograph “bartley  telling me something about your aunt last night she must have been  delightful person” winifred laughed “the bridge you see  just   foot   hill   noise   engines annoyed her very much  first but after she met bartley she pretended  like it  said    good thing   reminded  there  things going    world she loved life  bartley brought  great deal     her when  came   house aunt eleanor  very worldly   frank earlyvictorian manner she liked men  action  disliked young men who  careful  themselves  who  she put it  always trimming their wick  if they  afraid  their oil’s giving out mackeller bartley’s first chief   old friend  my aunt   told her  bartley   wild illgoverned youth which really pleased her very much i remember we  sitting alone   dusk after bartley had been there   first time i knew  aunt eleanor had found him much  her taste but she hadn’t said anything presently she came out   chuckle mackeller found him sowing wild oats  london i believe i hope  didn’t stop him too soon life coquets  dashing fellows the coming men  always like that we must have him  dinner my dear’ and we did she grew much fonder  bartley than she   me i had been studying  vienna  she thought  absurd she  interested   army   politics  she had  great contempt  music  art  philosophy she used  declare   prince consort had brought all  stuff over out  germany she always sniffed when bartley asked me  play  him she considered   newfangled way  making  match  it” when alexander came   few moments later  found wilson  his wife still confronting  photograph “oh let us get  out   way”  said laughing “winifred thomas can bring my trunk down i’ve decided  go over  new york tomorrow night  take  fast boat i shall save two days” chapter ii on  night  his arrival  london alexander went immediately   hotel   embankment  which  always stopped    lobby   accosted   old acquaintance maurice mainhall who fell upon him  effusive cordiality  indicated  willingness  dine  him bartley never dined alone if  could help it  mainhall   good gossip who always knew what had been going   town especially  knew everything   not printed   newspapers the nephew  one   standard victorian novelists mainhall bobbed about among  various literary cliques  london   outlying suburbs careful  lose touch  none  them he had written  number  books himself among them  “history  dancing”  “history  costume”  “key  shakespeare’s sonnets”  study  “the poetry  ernest dowson” etc although mainhall’s enthusiasm  often tiresome  although   often unable  distinguish between facts  vivid figments  his imagination his imperturbable good nature overcame even  people whom  bored most so  they ended  becoming   reluctant manner his friends in appearance mainhall  astonishingly like  conventional stageenglishman  american drama tall  thin  high hitching shoulders   small head glistening  closely brushed yellow hair he spoke   extreme oxford accent  when   talking well his face sometimes wore  rapt expression   very emotional man listening  music mainhall liked alexander because    engineer he had preconceived ideas about everything  his idea about americans   they should  engineers or mechanics he hated them when they presumed   anything else while they sat  dinner mainhall acquainted bartley   fortunes  his old friends  london   they left  table  proposed  they should go  see hugh macconnell’s new comedy “bog lights” “it’s really quite  best thing macconnell’s done”  explained  they got into  hansom “it’s tremendously well put on too florence merrill  cyril henderson but hilda burgoyne’s  hit   piece hugh’s written  delightful part  her  she’s quite inexpressible it’s been  only two weeks  i’ve been half  dozen times already i happen  have macconnell’s box  tonight or there’d  no chance  our getting places there’s everything  seeing hilda while she’s fresh   part she’s apt  grow  bit stale after  time the ones who have any imagination do” “hilda burgoyne” alexander exclaimed mildly “why i haven’t heard  her foryears” mainhall laughed “then you can’t have heard much  all my dear alexander it’s only lately since macconnell  his set have got hold  her  she’s come up myself i always knew she had   her if we had one real critic  londonbut what can one expect do you know alexander”mainhall looked  perplexity up into  top   hansom  rubbed his pink cheek  his gloved finger“do you know i sometimes think  taking  criticism seriously myself in  way  would   sacrifice but dear me we do need some one” just then they drove up   duke  york’s so alexander did not commit himself but followed mainhall into  theatre when they entered  stagebox   left  first act  well under way  scene being  interior   cabin   south  ireland as they sat down  burst  applause drew alexander’s attention   stage miss burgoyne  her donkey  thrusting their heads    half door “after all”  reflected “there’s small probability  her recognizing me she doubtless hasn’t thought  me  years” he felt  enthusiasm   house  once    few moments   caught up   current  macconnell’s irresistible comedy the audience had come forewarned evidently  whenever  ragged slip   donkeygirl ran upon  stage there   deep murmur  approbation every one smiled  glowed  mainhall hitched his heavy chair  little nearer  brass railing “you see”  murmured  alexander’s ear   curtain fell   first act “one almost never sees  part like  done without smartness or mawkishness of course hilda  irishthe burgoynes have been stage people  generationsand she   irish voice it’s delightful  hear    london theatre that laugh now when she doubles over   hipswho ever heard  out  galway she saves her hand too she’s  her best   second act she’s really macconnell’s poetic motif you see makes  whole thing  fairy tale” the second act opened before philly doyle’s underground still  peggy  her battered donkey come   smuggle  load  potheen across  bog   bring philly word  what  doing   world without   what  happening along  roadsides  ditches   first gleam  fine weather alexander annoyed  mainhall’s sighs  exclamations watched her  keen halfskeptical interest as mainhall had said she   second act  plot  feeling alike depended upon her lightness  foot her lightness  touch upon  shrewdness  deft fancifulness  played alternately  sometimes together  her mirthful brown eyes when she began  dance  way  showing  gossoons what she had seen   fairy rings  night  house broke into  prolonged uproar after her dance she withdrew   dialogue  retreated   ditch wall back  philly’s burrow where she sat singing “the rising   moon”  making  wreath  primroses  her donkey when  act  over alexander  mainhall strolled out into  corridor they met  good many acquaintances mainhall indeed knew almost every one   babbled  incontinently screwing his small head about over his high collar presently  hailed  tall bearded man grimbrowed  rather batteredlooking who had his opera cloak  his arm  his hat  his hand  who seemed     point  leaving  theatre “macconnell let me introduce mr bartley alexander i say it’s going famously tonight mac and what  audience you’ll never do anything like this again mark me a man writes   top  his bent only once” the playwright gave mainhall  curious look out  his deepset faded eyes  made  wry face “and have i done anything so fool  that now”  asked “that’s what i  saying” mainhall lounged  little nearer  dropped into  tone even more conspicuously confidential “and you’ll never bring hilda out like this again dear me mac  girl couldn’t possibly  better you know” macconnell grunted “she’ll do well enough if she keeps her pace  doesn’t go off  us   middle   season  she’s more than like  do” he nodded curtly  made   door dodging acquaintances   went “poor old hugh” mainhall murmured “he’s hit terribly hard he’s been wanting  marry hilda these three years  more she doesn’t take up  anybody you know irene burgoyne one  her family told me  confidence  there   romance somewhere back   beginning one  your countrymen alexander   way  american student whom she met  paris i believe i dare say it’s quite true  there’s never been any one else” mainhall vouched  her constancy   loftiness  made alexander smile even while  kind  rapid excitement  tingling through him blinking up   lights mainhall added  his luxurious worldly way “she’s  elegant little person  quite capable   extravagant bit  sentiment like that here comes sir harry towne he’s another who’s awfully keen about her let me introduce you sir harry towne mr bartley alexander  american engineer” sir harry towne bowed  said   had met mr alexander  his wife  tokyo mainhall cut  impatiently “i say sir harry  little girl’s going famously tonight isn’t she” sir harry wrinkled his brows judiciously “do you know i thought  dance  bit conscious tonight   first time the fact is she’s feeling rather seedy poor child westmere  i  back after  first act  we thought she seemed quite uncertain  herself a little attack  nerves possibly” he bowed   warning bell rang  mainhall whispered “you know lord westmere  coursethe stooped man   long gray mustache talking  lady dowle lady westmere  very fond  hilda” when they reached their box  house  darkened   orchestra  playing “the cloak  old gaul” in  moment peggy    stage again  alexander applauded vigorously   rest he even leaned forward over  rail  little for some reason  felt pleased  flattered   enthusiasm   audience in  halflight  looked about   stalls  boxes  smiled  little consciously recalling  amusement sir harry’s judicial frown he  beginning  feel  keen interest   slender barefoot donkeygirl who slipped   out   play singing like some one winding through  hilly field he leaned forward  beamed felicitations  warmly  mainhall himself when   end   play she came again  again before  curtain panting  little  flushed her eyes dancing  her eager nervous little mouth tremulous  excitement when alexander returned  his hotelhe shook mainhall   door   theatrehe had some supper brought up  his room    late before  went  bed he had not thought  hilda burgoyne  years indeed  had almost forgotten her he had last written  her  canada after  first met winifred telling her  everything  changed  himthat  had met  woman whom  would marry if  could if  could not then all  more  everything changed  him hilda had never replied  his letter he felt guilty  unhappy about her   time but after winifred promised  marry him  really forgot hilda altogether when  wrote her  everything  changed  him   telling  truth after  met winifred pemberton  seemed  himself like  different man one night when   winifred  sitting together   bridge  told her  things had happened while   studying abroad    sorry forone thing  particularand  asked her whether she thought she ought  know about them she considered  moment  then said “no i think not though i am glad you ask me you see one can’t  jealous about things  general but about particular definite personal things”here she had thrown her hands up  his shoulders   quick impulsive gesture“oh about those i should  very jealous i should torture myselfi couldn’t help it” after    easy  forget actually  forget he wondered tonight   poured his wine how many times  had thought  hilda   last ten years he had been  london more or less but  had never happened  hear  her “all  same”  lifted his glass “here’s  you little hilda you’ve made things come your way  i never thought you’d do it “of course”  reflected “she always had  combination  something homely  sensible  something utterly wild  daft but i never thought she’d do anything she hadn’t much ambition then  she  too fond  trifles she must care about  theatre  great deal more than she used to perhaps she  me  thank  something after all sometimes  little jolt like  does one good she   daft generous little thing i’m glad she’s held her own since after all we  awfully young it  youth  poverty  proximity  everything  young  kindly i shouldn’t wonder if she could laugh about   me now i shouldn’t wonder but they’ve probably spoiled her so  she’d  tiresome if one met her again” bartley smiled  yawned  went  bed chapter iii the next evening alexander dined alone   club   about nine o’clock  dropped    duke  york’s the house  sold out   stood through  second act when  returned  his hotel  examined  new directory  found miss burgoyne’s address still given  off bedford square though   new number he remembered that  so far  she had been brought up  all she had been brought up  bloomsbury her father  mother played   provinces most   year  she  left  great deal   care   old aunt who  crippled  rheumatism  who had had  leave  stage altogether in  days when alexander knew her hilda always managed  have  lodging  some sort about bedford square because she clung tenaciously  such scraps  shreds  memories   connected  it the mummy room   british museum had been one   chief delights  her childhood that forbidding pile   goal  her truant fancy  she  sometimes taken there   treat  other children  taken   theatre it  long since alexander had thought  any  these things but now they came back  him quite fresh  had  significance they did not have when they  first told him  his restless twenties so she  still   old neighborhood near bedford square the new number probably meant increased prosperity he hoped so he would like  know  she  snugly settled he looked  his watch it   quarter past ten she would not  home   good two hours yet   might  well walk over  have  look   place he remembered  shortest way it   warm smoky evening  there   grimy moon he went through covent garden  oxford street    turned into museum street  walked more slowly smiling  his own nervousness   approached  sullen gray mass   end he had not been inside  museum actually since   hilda used  meet there sometimes  set out  gay adventures  twickenham or richmond sometimes  linger about  place   while   ponder  lord elgin’s marbles upon  lastingness  some things or   mummy room upon  awful brevity  others since then bartley had always thought   british museum   ultimate repository  mortality where all  dead things   world  assembled  make one’s hour  youth  more precious one trembled lest before  got out  might somehow escape him lest  might drop  glass  overeagerness  see  shivered   stone floor  his feet how one hid his youth under his coat  hugged it and how good    turn one’s back upon all  vaulted cold  take hilda’s arm  hurry out   great door  down  steps into  sunlight among  pigeonsto know   warm  vital thing within him  still there  had not been snatched away  flush caesar’s lean cheek or  feed  veins  some bearded assyrian king they  their day had carried  flaming liquor but today  his so  song used  run  his head those summer mornings  dozen years ago alexander walked   place very quietly  if   afraid  waking some one he crossed bedford square  found  number   looking for the house  comfortable wellkept place enough  dark except   four front windows   second floor where  low even light  burning behind  white muslin sash curtains outside there  window boxes painted white  full  flowers bartley  making  third round   square when  heard  farflung hoofbeats

docks   farther shore   soft white stars  shining   wide sky above  river the next night   next alexander repeated this same foolish performance it  always miss burgoyne whom  started out  find   got no farther than  temple gardens   embankment it   pleasant kind  loneliness to  man who  so little given  reflection whose dreams always took  form  definite ideas reaching into  future there

british museum  night  who though  had tried  pass so quietly had known him  come down  linked  arm  his it  not until long afterward  alexander learned   him this youth   most dangerous  companions one sunday evening  lady walford’s alexander did  last meet hilda burgoyne mainhall had told him  she would probably  there he looked about  her rather nervously  finally found her   farther end   large drawingroom  centre   circle  men young  old she  apparently telling them  story they  all laughing  bending toward her when she saw alexander she rose quickly  put out her hand the other men drew back  little  let him approach “mr alexander i am delighted have you been  london long” bartley bowed somewhat laboriously over her hand “long enough  have seen you more than once how fine  all is” she laughed  if she  pleased “i’m glad you think so i like it won’t you join us here” “miss burgoyne  just telling us about  donkeyboy she had  galway last summer” sir harry towne explained   circle closed up again lord westmere stroked his long white mustache  his bloodless hand  looked  alexander blankly hilda   good storyteller she  sitting   edge  her chair  if she had alighted there   moment only her primrose satin gown seemed like  soft sheath  her slender supple figure   delicate color suited her white irish skin  brown hair whatever she wore people felt  charm  her active girlish body   slender hips  quick eager shoulders alexander heard little   story but  watched hilda intently she must certainly  reflected  thirty    honestly delighted  see   years had treated her so indulgently if her face had changed  all     slight hardening   mouthstill eager enough   very disconcerting  times  feltand   added air  selfpossession  selfreliance she carried her head too  little more resolutely when  story  finished miss burgoyne turned pointedly  alexander   other men drifted away “i thought i saw you  macconnell’s box  mainhall one evening but i supposed you had left town before this” she looked  him frankly  cordially  if   indeed merely  old friend whom she  glad  meet again “no i’ve been mooning about here” hilda laughed gayly “mooning i see you mooning you must   busiest man   world time  success have done well  you you know you’re handsomer than ever  you’ve gained  grand manner” alexander blushed  bowed “time  success have been good friends  both  us aren’t you tremendously pleased  yourself” she laughed again  shrugged her shoulders “oh soso but i want  hear about you several years ago i read such  lot   papers about  wonderful things you did  japan  how  emperor decorated you what  it commander   order   rising sun that sounds like the mikado’ and what about your new bridgein canada isn’t it  it’s    longest one   world   some queer name i can’t remember” bartley shook his head  smiled drolly “since when have you been interested  bridges or have you learned   interested  everything and    part  success” “why how absurd as if i  not always interested” hilda exclaimed “well i think we won’t talk about bridges here  any rate” bartley looked down   toe  her yellow slipper which  tapping  rug impatiently under  hem  her gown “but i wonder whether you’d think me impertinent if i asked you  let me come  see you sometime  tell you about them” “why should i ever so many people come  sunday afternoons” “i know mainhall offered  take me but you must know  i’ve been  london several times within  last few years  you might very well think  just now   rather inopportune time” she cut him short “nonsense one   pleasantest things about success    makes people want  look one up if that’s what you mean i’m like every one elsemore agreeable  meet when things  going well  me don’t you suppose  gives me any pleasure  do something  people like” “does it oh how fine  all is your coming  like this but i didn’t want you  think   because   i wanted  see you” he spoke very seriously  looked down   floor hilda studied him  wideeyed astonishment   moment  then broke into  low amused laugh “my dear mr alexander you have strange delicacies if you please   exactly why you wish  see me we understand that do we not” bartley looked ruffled  turned  seal ring  his little finger about awkwardly hilda leaned back  her chair watching him indulgently out  her shrewd eyes “come don’t  angry but don’t try  pose  me or   anything but what you are if you care  come it’s yourself i’ll  glad  see  you thinking well  yourself don’t try  wear  cloak  humility  doesn’t become you stalk   you   don’t make excuses i’m not accustomed  inquiring into  motives  my guests that would hardly  safe even  lady walford   great house like this” “sunday afternoon then” said alexander  she rose  join her hostess “how early may i come” she gave him her hand  flushed  laughed he bent over   little stiffly she went away  lady walford’s arm    stood watching her yellow train glide down  long floor  looked rather sullen he felt   had not come out   very brilliantly chapter iv on sunday afternoon alexander remembered miss burgoyne’s invitation  called  her apartment he found   delightful little place   met charming people there hilda lived alone attended   very pretty  competent french servant who answered  door  brought   tea alexander arrived early  some twentyodd people dropped  during  course   afternoon hugh macconnell came  his sister  stood about managing his teacup awkwardly  watching every one out  his deepset faded eyes he seemed  have made  resolute effort  tidiness  attire  his sister  robust florid woman   splendid joviality about her kept eyeing his freshly creased clothes apprehensively it  not very long indeed before his coat hung   discouraged sag  his gaunt shoulders  his hair  beard  rumpled  if  had been out   gale his dry humor went under  cloud  absentminded kindliness which mainhall explained always overtook him here he  never so witty or so sharp here  elsewhere  alexander thought  behaved  if    elderly relative come    young girl’s party the editor   monthly review came  his wife  lady kildare  irish philanthropist brought her young nephew robert owen who had come up  oxford  who  visibly excited  gratified  his first introduction  miss burgoyne hilda  very nice  him   sat   edge  his chair flushed  his conversational efforts  moving his chin about nervously over his high collar sarah frost  novelist came  her husband  very genial  placid old scholar who had become slightly deranged upon  subject   fourth dimension on other matters   perfectly rational    easy  pleasing  conversation he looked very much like agassiz  his wife  her oldfashioned black silk dress overskirted  tightsleeved reminded alexander   early pictures  mrs browning hilda seemed particularly fond  this quaint couple  bartley himself  so pleased  their mild  thoughtful converse   took his leave when they did  walked  them over  oxford street where they waited  their ‘bus they asked him  come  see them  chelsea  they spoke very tenderly  hilda “she’s  dear unworldly little thing” said  philosopher absently “more like  stage people  my young daysfolk  simple manners there aren’t many such left american tours have spoiled them i’m afraid they have all grown very smart lamb wouldn’t care  great deal about many  them i fancy” alexander went back  bedford square  second sunday afternoon he had  long talk  macconnell but  got no word  hilda alone   left   discontented state  mind for  rest   week   nervous  unsettled  kept rushing his work  if   preparing  immediate

writing  her livingroom under  light   tall desk lamp bartley recognized  primrose satin gown she had worn  first evening  lady walford’s “i’m so pleased  you think me worth  yellow dress you know”  said taking her hand  looking her over admiringly   toes  her canary slippers  her smoothly parted brown hair “yes it’s very very pretty every one  lady walford’s  looking  it” hilda curtsied “is  why

season so she keeps house  me  my little galway girl  gone home   visit i should never have asked you if molly had been here  i remember you don’t like english cookery” alexander walked about  room looking  everything “i haven’t had  chance yet  tell you what  jolly little place i think this is where did you get those etchings they’re quite unusual aren’t they” “lady westmere sent them  me  rome last christmas she  very much interested   american artist who did them they  all sketches made about  villa d’este you see he painted  group  cypresses   salon    bought   luxembourg” alexander walked over   bookcases “it’s  air   whole place here  i like you haven’t got anything  doesn’t belong seems  me  looks particularly well tonight and you have so many flowers i like these little yellow irises” “rooms always look better  lamplightin london  least though marie  cleanreally clean   french are why do you look   flowers so critically marie got them all fresh  covent garden market yesterday morning” “i’m glad” said alexander simply “i can’t tell you how glad i am  have you so pretty  comfortable here   hear every one saying such nice things about you you’ve got awfully nice friends”  added humbly picking up  little jade elephant  her desk “those fellows  all very loyal even mainhall they don’t talk  any one else  they do  you” hilda sat down   couch  said seriously “i’ve  neat little sum   bank too now  i own  mite   hut  galway it’s not worth much but i love it i’ve managed  save something every year    helping my three sisters now  then  tiding poor cousin mike over bad seasons he’s  gifted you know but   drink  loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get and i’ve traveled  bit too” marie opened  door  smilingly announced  dinner  served “my diningroom” hilda explained  she led  way “is  tiniest place you have ever seen” it   tiny room hung all round  french prints above which ran  shelf full  china hilda saw alexander look up  it “it’s not particularly rare” she said “but some    my mother’s heaven knows how she managed  keep  whole through all our wanderings or  what baskets  bundles  theatre trunks  hasn’t been stowed away we always had our tea out  those blue cups when i   little girl sometimes   queerest lodgings  sometimes   trunk   theatrequeer theatres   matter” it   wonderful little dinner there  watercress soup  sole   delightful omelette stuffed  mushrooms  truffles  two small rare ducklings  artichokes   dry yellow rhone wine  which bartley had always been very fond he drank  appreciatively  remarked  there  still no other  liked so well “i have some champagne  you too i don’t drink  myself but i like  see  behave when it’s poured there  nothing else  looks so jolly” “thank you but i don’t like  so well  this” bartley held  yellow wine against  light  squinted into    turned  glass slowly about “you have traveled you say have you been  paris much these late years” hilda lowered one   candleshades carefully “oh yes i go over  paris often there  few changes   old quarter dear old madame anger  deadbut perhaps you don’t remember her” “don’t i though i’m so sorry  hear it how did her son turn out i remember how she saved  scraped  him  how  always lay abed till ten o’clock he   laziest fellow   beaux arts  that’s saying  good deal” “well   still clever  lazy they say    good architect when   work he’s  big handsome creature   hates americans  much  ever but angeldo you remember angel” “perfectly did she ever get back  brittany  her bains de mer” “ah no poor angel she got tired  cooking  scouring  coppers  madame anger’s little kitchen so she ran away   soldier  then  another soldier too bad she still lives about  quarter and though there  always  soldat she  become  blanchisseuse de fin she did my blouses beautifully  last time i  there   so delighted  see me again i gave her all my old clothes even my old hats though she always wears her breton headdress her hair  still like flax  her blue eyes  just like  baby’s  she   same three freckles  her little nose  talks about going back  her bains de mer” bartley looked  hilda across  yellow light   candles  broke into  low happy laugh “how jolly   being young hilda do you remember  first walk we took together  paris we walked down   place saintmichel  buy some lilacs do you remember how sweet they smelled” “indeed i do come we’ll have our coffee   other room  you can smoke” hilda rose quickly  if she wished  change  drift  their talk but bartley found  pleasant  continue it “what  warm soft spring evening  was”  went on  they sat down   study   coffee   little table between them “and  sky over  bridges  just  color   lilacs we walked  down   river didn’t we” hilda laughed  looked  him questioningly he saw  gleam  her eyes   remembered even better than  episode   recalling “i think we did” she answered demurely “it    quai we met  woman who  crying so bitterly i gave her  spray  lilac i remember  you gave her  franc i  frightened  your prodigality” “i expect    last franc i had what  strong brown face she had  very tragic she looked  us  such despair  longing out  under her black shawl what she wanted  us  neither our flowers nor our francs but just our youth i remember  touched me so i would have given her some  mine off my back if i could i had enough   spare then” bartley mused  looked thoughtfully  his cigar they  both remembering what  woman had said when she took  money “god give you  happy love” it  not   ingratiating tone   habitual beggar  had come out   depths   poor creature’s sorrow vibrating  pity  their youth  despair   terribleness  human life  had  anguish   voice  prophecy until she spoke bartley had not realized     love the strange woman  her passionate sentence  rang out so sharply had frightened them both they went home sadly   lilacs back   rue saintjacques walking very slowly arm  arm when they reached  house where hilda lodged bartley went across  court  her  up  dark old stairs   third landing  there  had kissed her   first time he had shut his eyes  give him  courage  remembered  she had trembled so bartley started when hilda rang  little bell beside her “dear me why did you do that i had quite forgotteni  back there it  very jolly”  murmured lazily  marie came   take away  coffee hilda laughed  went over   piano “well we  neither  us twenty now you know have i told you about my new play mac  writing one really  me this time you see i’m coming on” “i’ve seen nothing else what kind   part  it shall you wear yellow gowns i hope so” he  looking  her round slender figure  she stood   piano turning over  pile  music   felt  energy  every line  it “no  isn’t  dressup part he doesn’t seem  fancy me  fine feathers he says i ought   minding  pigs  home  i suppose i ought but he’s given me some good irish songs listen” she sat down   piano  sang when she finished alexander shook himself out   reverie “sing the harp that once’ hilda you used  sing  so well” “nonsense of course i can’t really sing except  way my mother  grandmother did before me most actresses nowadays learn  sing properly so i tried  master but  confused me just” alexander laughed “all  same sing it hilda” hilda started up   stool  moved restlessly toward  window “it’s really too warm  this room  sing don’t you feel it” alexander went over  opened  window  her “aren’t you afraid  let  wind low like   your neck can’t i get  scarf or something” “ask  theatre lady if she’s afraid  drafts” hilda laughed “but perhaps  i’m so warmgive me your handkerchief there just  front” he slipped  corners carefully under her shoulderstraps “there   do it looks like  bib” she pushed his hand away quickly  stood looking out into  deserted square “isn’t london  tomb  sunday night” alexander caught  agitation  her voice he stood  little behind her  tried  steady himself   said “it’s soft  misty see how white  stars are” for  long time neither hilda nor bartley spoke they stood close together looking out into  wan watery sky breathing always more quickly  lightly   seemed  if all  clocks   world had stopped suddenly  moved  clenched hand  held behind him  dropped  violently  his side he felt  tremor run through  slender yellow figure  front  him she caught his handkerchief  her throat  thrust   him without turning round “here take it you must go now bartley goodnight” bartley leaned over her shoulder without touching her  whispered  her ear “you  giving me  chance” “yes take   go this isn’t fair you know goodnight” alexander unclenched  two hands  his sides with one  threw down  window    otherstill standing behind herhe drew her back against him she uttered  little cry threw her arms over her head  drew his face down  hers “are you going  let me love you  little bartley” she whispered chapter v it   afternoon   day before christmas mrs alexander had been driving about all  morning leaving presents   houses  her friends she lunched alone   she rose   table she spoke   butler “thomas i am going down   kitchen now  see norah in half  hour you   bring  greens up   cellar  put them   library mr alexander   home

little before three o’clock mrs alexander went into  library  see  everything  ready she pulled  window shades high   weather  dark  stormy  there  little light even   streets a foot  snow had fallen during  morning   wide space over  river  thick  flying flakes  fell  wreathed  masses  floating ice winifred  standing   window when she heard  front door open she hurried   hall  alexander came stamping in covered  snow he kissed her joyfully  brushed away  snow  fell  her hair “i wish i had asked you  meet me   office  walk home  me winifred the common  beautiful the boys have swept  snow off  pond   skating furiously did  cyclamens come” “an hour ago what splendid ones but aren’t you frightfully extravagant” “not  christmastime i’ll go upstairs  change my coat i shall  down   moment tell thomas  get everything ready” when alexander reappeared  took his wife’s arm  went  her into  library “when did  azaleas get here thomas  got  white one  my room” “i told him  put  there” “but i say it’s much  finest   lot” “that’s why i had  put there there  too much color   room   red one you know” bartley began  sort  greens “it looks very splendid there but i feel piggish  have it however we really spend more time there than anywhere else   house will you hand me  holly” he climbed up  stepladder which creaked under his weight  began  twist  tough stems   holly into  framework   chandelier “i forgot  tell you  i had  letter  wilson this morning explaining his telegram he  coming  because  old uncle up  vermont  conveniently died  left wilson  little moneysomething like ten thousand he’s coming   settle up  estate won’t   jolly  have him” “and how fine  he’s come into  little money i can see him posting down state street   steamship offices he  get  good many trips out

you’ve had  busy morning  i don’t want you   tired tonight” after his wife went upstairs alexander worked energetically   greens   few moments then    cutting off  length  string  sighed suddenly  sat down staring out   window   snow the animation died out  his face but  his eyes there   restless light  look  apprehension  suspense he kept clasping  unclasping his big hands  if   trying  realize something the clock ticked through  minutes   halfhour   afternoon outside began  thicken  darken turbidly alexander since  first sat down had not changed his position he leaned forward his hands between his knees scarcely breathing  if   holding himself away  his surroundings   room    very chair  which  sat  everything except  wild eddies  snow above  river  which his eyes  fixed  feverish intentness  if   trying  project himself thither when  last lucius wilson  announced alexander sprang eagerly  his feet  hurried  meet his old instructor “hello wilson what luck come into  library we   have  lot  people  dinner tonight  winifred’s lying down you  excuse her won’t you and now what about yourself sit down  tell me everything” “i think i’d rather move about if you don’t mind i’ve been sitting   train   week  seems  me” wilson stood before  fire  his hands behind him  looked about  room “you have been busy bartley if i’d had my choice  all possible places  which  spend christmas your house would certainly   place i’d have chosen happy people do  great deal  their friends a house like this throws  warmth out i felt  distinctly  i  coming through  berkshires i could scarcely believe  i   see mrs bartley again so soon” “thank you wilson she’ll   glad  see you shall we have tea now i’ll ring  thomas  clear away this litter winifred says i always wreck  house when i try  do anything do you know i am quite tired looks  if i  not used  work doesn’t it” alexander laughed  dropped into  chair “you know i’m sailing  day after new year’s” “again why you’ve been over twice since i  here   spring haven’t you” “oh i   london about ten days   summer went  escape  hot weather more than anything else i shan’t  gone more than  month this time winifred  i have been up  canada  most   autumn that moorlock bridge   my back all  time i never had so much trouble   job before” alexander moved about restlessly  fell  poking  fire “haven’t i seen   papers  there  some trouble about  tidewater bridge  yours  new jersey” “oh  doesn’t amount  anything it’s held up   steel strike a bother  course but  sort  thing one  always having  put up with but  moorlock bridge   continual anxiety you see  truth is we  having  build pretty well   strain limit up there they’ve crowded me too much   cost it’s all very well if everything goes well but these estimates have never been used  anything  such length before however there’s nothing   done they hold me   scale i’ve used  shorter bridges the last thing  bridge commission cares about   kind  bridge you build” when bartley had finished dressing  dinner  went into his study where  found his wife arranging flowers  his writingtable “these pink roses just came  mrs hastings” she said smiling “and i am sure she meant them  you” bartley looked about   air  satisfaction   greens   wreaths   windows “have you  moment winifred i have just now been thinking  this  our twelfth christmas can you realize it” he went up   table  took her hands away   flowers drying them  his pocket handkerchief “they’ve been awfully happy ones all  them haven’t they” he took her  his arms  bent back lifting her  little  giving her  long kiss “you  happy aren’t you winifred more than anything else   world i want you   happy sometimes  late i’ve thought you looked  if you  troubled” “no it’s only when you  troubled  harassed  i feel worried bartley i wish you always seemed  you do tonight but you don’t always” she looked earnestly  inquiringly into his eyes alexander took her two hands  his shoulders  swung them back  forth  his own laughing his big blond laugh “i’m growing older my dear that’s what you feel now may i show you something i meant  save them until tomorrow but i want you  wear them tonight” he took  little leather box out  his pocket  opened it on  white velvet lay two long pendants  curiously worked gold set  pearls winifred looked   box  bartley  exclaimed “where did you ever find such gold work bartley” “it’s old flemish isn’t  fine” “they   most beautiful things dear but you know i never wear earrings” “yes yes i know but i want you  wear them i have always wanted you to so few women can there must   good ear  begin with   nose”he waved his hand“above reproach most women look silly  them they go only  faces like yoursvery very proud  just  little hard” winifred laughed  she went over   mirror  fitted  delicate springs   lobes  her ears “oh bartley  old foolishness about my being hard it really hurts my feelings but i must go down now people  beginning  come” bartley drew her arm about his neck  went   door  her “not hard  me winifred”  whispered “never never hard  me” left alone  paced up  down his study he   home again among all  dear familiar things  spoke  him  so many happy years his house tonight would  full  charming people who liked  admired him yet all  time underneath his pleasure  hopefulness  satisfaction   conscious   vibration   unnatural excitement amid this light  warmth  friendliness  sometimes started  shuddered  if some one had stepped  his grave something had broken loose  him  which  knew nothing except    sullen  powerful    wrung  tortured him sometimes  came upon him softly  enervating reveries sometimes  battered him like  cannon rolling   hold   vessel always now  brought    sense  quickened life  stimulating danger tonight  came upon him suddenly    walking  floor after his wife left him it seemed impossible  could not believe it he glanced entreatingly   door  if  call her back he heard voices   hall below  knew   must go down going over

escape he shut his eyes  pressed his forehead against  cold window glass breathing   chill  came through it “that this”  groaned “that this should have happened  me” on new year’s day  thaw set in  during  night torrents  rain fell in  morning  morning  alexander’s departure  england  river  streaked  fog   rain drove hard against  windows   breakfastroom alexander had finished his coffee   pacing up  down his wife sat   table watching him she  pale  unnaturally calm when thomas brought  letters bartley sank into his chair  ran them over rapidly “here’s  note  old wilson he’s safe back  his grind  says  had  bully time the memory  mrs bartley  make my whole winter fragrant’ just like him he  go  getting measureless satisfaction out  you  his study fire what  man    looking   life” bartley sighed pushed  letters back impatiently  went over   window “this   nasty sort  day  sail i’ve  notion  call  off next week would  time enough” “that would only mean starting twice it wouldn’t really help you out  all” mrs alexander spoke soothingly “and you’d come back late  all your engagements” bartley began jingling some loose coins  his pocket “i wish things would let me rest i’m tired  work tired  people tired  trailing about” he looked out   stormbeaten river winifred came up behind him  put  hand  his shoulder “that’s what you always say poor bartley at bottom you really like all these things can’t you remember that” he put his arm about her “all  same life runs smoothly enough  some people   me it’s always  messy sort  patchwork it’s like  song peace  where i am not how can you face  all  so much fortitude” she looked  him   clear gaze which wilson had so much admired which  had felt implied such high confidence  fearless pride “oh i faced  long ago when you   your first bridge up  old allway i knew then  your paths  not   paths  peace but i decided  i wanted  follow them” bartley  his wife stood silent   long time  fire crackled   grate  rain beat insistently upon  windows   sleepy angora looked up  them curiously presently thomas made  discreet sound   door “shall edward bring down your trunks sir” “yes they  ready tell him not  forget  big portfolio   study table” thomas withdrew closing  door softly bartley turned away  his wife still holding her hand “it never gets any easier winifred” they both started   sound   carriage   pavement outside alexander sat down  leaned his head  his hand his wife bent over him “courage” she said gayly bartley rose  rang  bell thomas brought him his hat  stick  ulster at  sight  these  supercilious angora moved restlessly quitted her red cushion   fire  came up waving her tail  vexation  these ominous indications  change alexander stooped  stroke her  then plunged into his coat  drew  his gloves his wife held his stick smiling bartley smiled too  his eyes cleared “i’ll work like  devil winifred   home again before you realize i’ve gone” he kissed her quickly several times hurried out   front door into  rain  waved  her   carriage window   driver  starting his melancholy dripping black horses alexander sat  his hands clenched  his knees as  carriage turned up  hill  lifted one hand  brought  down violently “this time”he spoke aloud  through his set teeth“this time i’m going  end it” on  afternoon   third day out alexander  sitting well   stern   windward side where  chairs  few his rugs over him   collar  his furlined coat turned up about his ears the weather had so far been dark  raw for two hours  had been watching  low dirty sky   beating   heavy rain upon  ironcolored sea there   long oily swell  made exercise laborious the decks smelled  damp woolens   air  so humid  drops  moisture kept gathering upon his hair  mustache he seldom moved except  brush them away the great open spaces made him passive   restlessness   water quieted him he intended during  voyage  decide upon  course  action but  held all this away  him   present  lay   blessed gray oblivion deep down  him somewhere his resolution  weakening  strengthening ebbing  flowing the thing  perturbed him went   steadily  his pulse but   almost unconscious  it he  submerged   vast impersonal grayness about him   intervals  sidelong roll   boat measured off time like  ticking   clock he felt released  everything  troubled  perplexed him it   if  had tricked  outwitted torturing memories had actually managed  get  board without them he thought  nothing  all if his mind now  again picked  face out   grayness   lucius wilson’s or  face   old schoolmate forgotten  years or    slim outline   favorite greyhound  used  hunt jackrabbits  when    boy toward six o’clock  wind rose  tugged   tarpaulin  brought  swell higher after dinner alexander came back   wet deck piled his damp rugs over him again  sat smoking losing himself   obliterating blackness  drowsing   rush   gale before  went below  few bright stars  pricked off between heavily moving masses  cloud the next morning  bright  mild   fresh breeze alexander felt  need  exercise even before  came out  his cabin when  went  deck  sky  blue  blinding  heavy whiffs  white cloud smokecolored   edges moving rapidly across it the water  roughish  cold clear indigo breaking into whitecaps bartley walked  two hours  then stretched himself   sun until lunchtime in  afternoon  wrote  long letter  winifred later   walked  deck through  splendid golden sunset his spirits rose continually it  agreeable  come  himself again after several days  numbness  torpor he stayed out until  last tinge  violet had faded   water there  literally  taste  life  his lips   sat down  dinner  ordered  bottle  champagne he  late  finishing his dinner  drank rather more wine than  had meant to when  went above  wind had risen   deck  almost deserted as  stepped out   door  gale lifted his heavy fur coat about his shoulders he fought his way up  deck  keen exhilaration the moment  stepped almost out  breath behind  shelter   stern  wind  cut off   felt like  rush  warm air  sense  close  intimate companionship he started back  tore his coat open  if something warm  actually clinging  him beneath it he hurried up  deck  went into  saloon parlor full  women who had retreated thither   sharp wind he threw himself upon them he talked delightfully   older ones  played accompaniments   younger ones until  last sleepy girl had followed her mother below then  went into  smokingroom he played bridge until two o’clock   morning  managed  lose  considerable sum  money without really noticing    doing so after  break  one fine day  weather  pretty consistently dull when  low sky thinned  trifle  pale white spot   sun did no more than throw  bluish lustre   water giving   dark brightness  newly cut lead through one after another  those gray days alexander drowsed  mused drinking   grateful moisture but  complete peace   first part   voyage  over sometimes  rose suddenly  his chair  if driven out  paced  deck  hours people noticed his propensity  walking  rough weather  watched him curiously   did his rounds from his abstraction   determined set  his jaw they fancied  must  thinking about his bridge every one had heard   new cantilever bridge  canada but alexander  not thinking about his work after  fourth night out when his  suddenly softened under his hands  had been continually hammering away  himself more  more often when  first wakened   morning or when  stepped into  warm place after being chilled   deck  felt  sudden painful delight  being nearer another shore sometimes when   most despondent when  thought himself worn out  this struggle   flash   free    leaped into  overwhelming consciousness  himself on  instant  felt  marvelous return   impetuousness  intense excitement  increasing expectancy  youth chapter vi the last two days   voyage bartley found almost intolerable the stop  queenstown  tedious passage up  mersey  things   noted dimly through his growing impatience he had planned  stop  liverpool but instead  took  boat train  london emerging  euston  halfpast three o’clock   afternoon alexander had his luggage sent   savoy  drove  once  bedford square when marie met him   door even her strong sense   proprieties could not restrain her surprise  delight she blushed  smiled  fumbled his card  her confusion before she ran upstairs alexander paced up  down  hallway buttoning  unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned  took him up  hilda’s livingroom the room  empty when  entered a coal fire  crackling   grate   lamps  lit    already beginning  grow dark outside alexander did not sit down he stood his ground over   windows until hilda came in she called his name   threshold but  her swift flight across  room she felt  change  him  caught herself up so deftly   could not tell just when she did it she merely brushed his cheek  her lips  put  hand lightly  joyously  either shoulder “oh what  grand thing  happen   raw day i felt   my bones when i woke this morning  something splendid  going  turn up i thought  might  sister kate or cousin mike would  happening along i never dreamed  would  you bartley but why do you let me chatter  like this come over   fire you’re chilled through” she pushed him toward  big chair   fire  sat down   stool   opposite side   hearth her knees drawn up  her chin laughing like  happy little girl “when did you come bartley  how did  happen you haven’t spoken  word” “i got  about ten minutes ago i landed  liverpool this morning  came down   boat train” alexander leaned forward  warmed his hands before  blaze hilda watched him  perplexity “there’s something troubling you bartley what  it” bartley bent lower over  fire “it’s  whole thing  troubles me hilda you  i” hilda took  quick soft breath she looked  his heavy shoulders  big determined head thrust forward like  catapult  leash “what about us bartley” she asked   thin voice he locked  unlocked his hands over  grate  spread his fingers close   bluish flame while  coals crackled   clock ticked   street vendor began  call under  window at last alexander brought out one word “everything” hilda  pale  this time  her eyes  wide  fright she looked about desperately  bartley   door then   windows  back again  bartley she rose uncertainly touched his hair  her hand then sank back upon her stool “i’ll do anything you wish me to bartley” she said tremulously “i can’t stand seeing you miserable” “i can’t live  myself any longer”  answered roughly he rose  pushed  chair behind him  began  walk miserably about  room seeming  find  too small  him he pulled up  window  if  air  heavy hilda watched him  her corner trembling  scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes “it     hasn’t always made you miserable  it” her eyelids fell  her lips quivered “always but it’s worse now it’s unbearable it tortures me every minute” “but why now” she asked piteously wringing her hands he ignored her question “i am not  man who can live two lives”  went  feverishly “each life spoils  other i get nothing but misery out  either the world  all there just   used  be but i can’t get   any more there  this deception between me  everything” at  word “deception” spoken  such selfcontempt  color flashed back into hilda’s face  suddenly  if she had been struck   whiplash she bit her lip  looked down  her hands which  clasped tightly  front  her “could youcould you sit down  talk about  quietly bartley  if i   friend  not some one who had   defied” he dropped back heavily into his chair   fire “it  myself i  defying hilda i have thought about  until i am worn out” he looked  her  his haggard face softened he put out his hand toward her   looked away again into  fire she crept across  him drawing her stool after her “when did you first begin  feel like this bartley” “after  very first the first wassort   play wasn’t it” hilda’s face quivered but she whispered “yes i think  must have been but why didn’t you tell me when you  here   summer” alexander groaned “i meant to but somehow i couldn’t we had only  few days  your new play  just on  you  so happy” “yes i  happy wasn’t i” she pressed his hand gently  gratitude “weren’t you happy then  all” she closed her eyes  took  deep breath  if  draw  again  fragrance  those days something  their troubling sweetness came back  alexander too he moved uneasily  his chair creaked “yes i  then you know but afterward  ” “yes yes” she hurried pulling her hand gently away  him presently  stole back  his coat sleeve “please tell me one thing bartley at least tell me  you believe i thought i  making you happy” his hand shut down quickly over  questioning fingers  his sleeves “yes hilda i know that”  said simply she leaned her head against his arm  spoke softly “you see my mistake   wanting you  have everything i wanted you  eat all  cakes  have them too i somehow believed  i could take all  bad consequences  you i wanted you always   happy  handsome  successfulto have all  things   great man ought  have and once   way  careless holidays  great men  not permitted” bartley gave  bitter little laugh  hilda looked up  read   deepening lines  his face  youth  bartley would not much longer struggle together “i understand bartley i  wrong but i didn’t know you’ve only  tell me now what must i do  i’ve not done or what must i not do” she listened intently but she heard nothing but  creaking  his chair “you want me  say it” she whispered “you want  tell me  you can only see me like this  old friends do or out   world among people i can do that” “i can’t”  said heavily hilda shivered  sat still bartley leaned his head  his hands  spoke through his teeth “it’s got    clean break hilda i can’t see you  all anywhere what i mean   i want you  promise never  see me again no matter how often i come no matter how hard i beg” hilda sprang up like  flame she stood over him  her hands clenched  her side her body rigid “no” she gasped “it’s too late  ask that do you hear me bartley it’s too late i won’t promise it’s abominable  you  ask me keep away if you wish when have i ever followed you but if you come  me i’ll do  i see fit the shamefulness  your asking me  do that if you come  me i’ll do  i see fit do you understand bartley you’re cowardly” alexander rose  shook himself angrily “yes i know i’m cowardly i’m afraid  myself i don’t trust myself any more i carried  all lightly enough  first but now i don’t dare trifle  it it’s getting  better  me it’s different now i’m growing older  you’ve got my young self here  you it’s through him  i’ve come  wish  you all  all  time” he took her roughly  his arms “do you know what i mean” hilda held her face back  him  began  cry bitterly “oh bartley what am i  do why didn’t you let me  angry  you you ask me  stay away  you because you want me and i’ve got nobody but you i  do anything you saybut that i  ask  least imaginable but i must have something” bartley turned away  sank down  his chair again hilda sat   arm    put her hands lightly  his shoulders “just something bartley i must have you  think  through  months  months  loneliness i must see you i must know about you the sight  you bartley  see you living  happy  successfulcan i never make you understand what  means  me” she pressed his shoulders gently “you see loving some one  i love you makes  whole world different if i’d met you later if i hadn’t loved you so wellbut that’s all over long ago then came all those years without you lonely  hurt  discouraged those decent young fellows  poor mac  me never heedinghard   steel spring and then you came back not caring very much but  made no difference” she slid   floor beside him  if she  too tired  sit up any longer bartley bent over  took her  his arms kissing her mouth  her wet tired eyes “don’t cry don’t cry”  whispered “we’ve tortured each other enough  tonight forget everything except  i am here” “i think i have forgotten everything but  already” she murmured “ah your dear arms” chapter vii during  fortnight  alexander   london  drove himself hard he got through  great deal  personal business  saw  great many men who  doing interesting things  his own profession he disliked  think  his visits  london  holidays  when   there  worked even harder than  did  home the day before his departure  liverpool   singularly fine one the thick air had cleared overnight   strong wind which brought   golden dawn  then fell off   fresh breeze when bartley looked out  his windows   savoy  river  flashing silver   gray stone along  embankment  bathed  bright clear sunshine london had wakened  life after three weeks  cold  sodden rain bartley breakfasted hurriedly  went over his mail while  hotel valet packed his trunks then  paid his account  walked rapidly down  strand past charing cross station his spirits rose  every step  when  reached trafalgar square blazing   sun   fountains playing   column reaching up into  bright air  signaled   hansom and before  knew what   about told  driver  go  bedford square  way   british museum when  reached hilda’s apartment she met him fresh   morning itself her rooms  flooded  sunshine  full   flowers  had been sending her she would never let him give her anything else “are you busy this morning hilda”  asked   sat down his hat  gloves  his hand “very i’ve been up  about three hours working  my part we open  february you know” “well then you’ve worked enough and so have i i’ve seen all my men my packing  done  i go up  liverpool this evening but this morning we  going  have  holiday what do you say   drive out  kew  richmond you may not get another day like this all winter it’s like  fine april day  home may i use your telephone i want  order  carriage” “oh how jolly there sit down   desk and while you  telephoning i’ll change my dress i shan’t  long all  morning papers    table” hilda  back   few moments wearing  long gray squirrel coat   broad fur hat bartley rose  inspected her “why don’t you wear some  those pink roses”  asked “but they came only this morning  they have not even begun  open i  saving them i am so unconsciously thrifty” she laughed  she looked about  room “you’ve been sending me far too many flowers bartley new ones every day that’s too often though i do love  open  boxes  i take good care  them” “why won’t you let me send you any  those jade or ivory things you  so fond of or pictures i know  good deal about pictures” hilda shook her large hat  she drew  roses out   tall glass “no there  some things you can’t do there’s  carriage will you button my gloves  me” bartley took her wrist  began  button  long gray suede glove “how gay your eyes  this morning hilda” “that’s because i’ve been studying it always stirs me up  little” he pushed  top   glove up slowly “when did you learn  take hold  your parts like that” “when i had nothing else  think of come  carriage  waiting what  shocking while you take” “i’m  no hurry we’ve plenty  time” they found all london abroad piccadilly   stream  rapidly moving carriages  which flashed furs  flowers  bright winter costumes the metal trappings   harnesses shone dazzlingly   wheels  revolving disks  threw off rays  light the parks  full  children  nursemaids  joyful dogs  leaped  yelped  scratched up  brown earth  their paws “i’m not going until tomorrow you know” bartley announced suddenly “i’ll cut off  day  liverpool i haven’t felt so jolly this long while” hilda looked up   smile which she tried not  make too glad “i think people  meant   happy  little” she said they had lunch  richmond  then walked  twickenham where they had sent  carriage they drove back   glorious sunset behind them toward  distant goldwashed city it  one  those rare afternoons when all  thickness  shadow  london  changed   kind  shining pulsing special atmosphere when  smoky vapors become fluttering golden clouds nacreous veils  pink  amber when all  bleakness  gray stone  dullness  dirty brick trembles  aureate light  all  roofs  spires  one great dome  floated  golden haze on such rare afternoons  ugliest  cities becomes  most poetic  months  sodden days  offset   moment  miracle “it’s like   us londoners too” hilda  saying “everything  awfully grim  cheerless our weather  our houses  our ways  amusing ourselves but we can  happier than anybody we can go mad  joy   people do out   fields   fine whitsunday we make  most  our moment” she thrust her little chin out defiantly over her gray fur collar  bartley looked down  her  laughed “you   plucky one you” he patted her glove  his hand “yes you   plucky one” hilda sighed “no i’m not not about some things  any rate it doesn’t take pluck  fight  one’s moment but  takes pluck  go withouta lot more than i have i can’t help it” she added fiercely after miles  outlying streets  little gloomy houses they reached london itself red  roaring  murky   thick dampness coming up   river  betokened fog again tomorrow the streets  full  people who had worked indoors all through  priceless day  had now come hungrily out  drink  muddy lees  it they stood  long black lines waiting before  pit entrances   theatresshortcoated boys  girls  sailor hats all shivering  chatting gayly there   blurred rhythm  all  dull city noisesin  clatter   cab horses   rumbling   busses   street calls    undulating tramp tramp   crowd it  like  deep vibration  some vast underground machinery  like  muffled pulsations  millions  human hearts see “the barrel organ  alfred noyes ed i have placed    end  your convenience “seems good  get back doesn’t it” bartley whispered  they drove  bayswater road into oxford street “london always makes me want  live more than any other city   world you remember our priestess mummy over   mummyroom  how we used  long  go  bring her out  nights like this three thousand years ugh” “all  same i believe she used  feel  when we stood there  watched her  wished her well i believe she used  remember” hilda said thoughtfully “i hope so now let’s go  some awfully jolly place  dinner before we go home i could eat all  dinners there   london tonight where shall i tell  driver the piccadilly restaurant the music’s good there” “there  too many people there whom one knows why not  little french place  soho where we went so often when you  here   summer i love it  i’ve never been there  any one but you sometimes i go  myself when i am particularly lonely” “very well  sole’s good there how many street pianos there  about tonight the fine weather must have thawed them out we’ve had five miles  il trovatore’ now they always make me feel jaunty are you comfy  not too tired” “i’m not tired  all i  just wondering how people can ever die why did you remind me   mummy life seems  strongest  most indestructible thing   world do you really believe  all those people rushing about down there going  good dinners  clubs  theatres   dead some day  not care about anything i don’t believe it  i know i shan’t die ever you see i feel tootoo powerful” the carriage stopped bartley sprang out  swung her quickly   pavement as  lifted her  his two hands  whispered “you arepowerful” chapter viii the last rehearsal  over  tedious dress rehearsal which had lasted all day  exhausted  patience  every one who had  do  it when hilda had dressed   street  came out  her dressingroom she found hugh macconnell waiting  her   corridor “the fog’s thicker than ever hilda there have been  great many accidents today it’s positively unsafe  you   out alone will you let me take you home” “how good  you mac if you  going  me i think i’d rather walk i’ve had no exercise today  all this  made me nervous” “i shouldn’t wonder” said macconnell dryly hilda pulled down her veil  they stepped out into  thick brown wash  submerged st martin’s lane macconnell took her hand  tucked  snugly under his arm “i’m sorry i  such  savage i hope you didn’t think i made  ass  myself” “not  bit  it i don’t wonder you  peppery those things  awfully trying how do you think it’s going” “magnificently that’s why i got so stirred up we  going  hear  this both  us and  reminds me i’ve got news  you they  going  begin repairs   theatre about  middle  march  we   run over  new york  six weeks bennett told me yesterday    decided” hilda looked up delightedly   tall gray figure beside her he   only thing she could see  they  moving through  dense opaqueness  if they  walking   bottom   ocean “oh mac how glad i am and they love your things over there don’t they” “shall you  glad forany other reason hilda” macconnell put his hand  front  her  ward off some dark object it proved   only  lamppost  they beat  farther   edge   pavement “what do you mean mac” hilda asked nervously “i  just thinking there might  people over there you’d  glad  see”  brought out awkwardly hilda said nothing   they walked  macconnell spoke again apologetically “i hope you don’t mind my knowing about it hilda don’t stiffen up like that no one else knows  i didn’t try  find out anything i felt it even before i knew who  was i knew there  somebody    wasn’t i” they crossed oxford street  silence feeling their way the busses had stopped running   cabdrivers  leading their horses when they reached  other side macconnell said suddenly “i hope you  happy” “terribly dangerously happy mac”hilda spoke quietly pressing  rough sleeve  his greatcoat  her gloved hand “you’ve always thought me too old  you hildaoh  course you’ve never said just thatand here this fellow  not more than eight years younger than i i’ve always felt  if i could get out  my old case i might win you yet it’s  fine brave youth i carry inside me only he’ll never  seen” “nonsense mac that  nothing  do  it it’s because you seem too close  me too much my own kind it would  like marrying cousin mike almost i really tried  care  you wanted me to away back   beginning” “well here we are turning out   square you  not angry  me hilda thank you  this walk my dear go   get dry things   once you’ll  having  great night tomorrow” she put out her hand “thank you mac  everything goodnight” macconnell trudged off through  fog  she went slowly upstairs her slippers  dressing gown  waiting  her before  fire “i shall certainly see him  new york he  see   papers  we  coming perhaps  knows  already” hilda kept thinking  she undressed “perhaps      dock no scarcely that but i may meet him   street even before  comes  see me” marie placed  teatable   fire  brought hilda her letters she looked them over  started  she came  one   handwriting  she did not often see alexander had written  her only twice before   did not allow her  write  him  all “thank you marie you may go now” hilda sat down   table   letter  her hand still unopened she looked   intently turned  over  felt  thickness  her fingers she believed  she sometimes had  kind  secondsight about letters  could tell before she read them whether they brought good or evil tidings she put this one down   table  front

walked downand without overshoes” hilda hid her face  her hands “i  afraid  take  cab can’t you see bartley  i’m terribly frightened i’ve been through this  hundred times today don’t  any more angry than you can help i  all right until i knew you   town if you’d sent me  note or telephoned me or anything but you won’t let me write  you  i had  see you after  letter  terrible letter you wrote me when you got home” alexander faced her resting his arm   mantel behind him  began  brush  sleeve  his jacket “is this  way you mean  answer it hilda”  asked unsteadily she  afraid  look up  him “didn’tdidn’t you mean even  say goodby  me bartley did you mean just toquit me” she asked “i came  tell you  i’m willing  do  you asked me but it’s no use talking about  now give me my things please” she put her hand out toward  fender alexander sat down   arm  her chair “did you think i had forgotten you   town hilda do you think i kept away  accident did you suppose i didn’t know you  sailing  tuesday there   letter  you there  my desk drawer it   have reached you   steamer i  all  morning writing it i told myself  if i  really thinking  you  not  myself  letter would  better than nothing marks  paper mean something  you” he paused “they never did  me” hilda smiled up  him beautifully  put her hand  his sleeve “oh bartley did you write  me why didn’t you telephone me  let me know  you had then i wouldn’t have come” alexander slipped his arm about her “i didn’t know  before hilda  my honor i didn’t but i believe   because deep down  me somewhere i  hoping i might drive you  do just this i’ve watched  door all day i’ve jumped up if  fire crackled i think i have felt  you  coming” he bent his face over her hair “and i” she whispered“i felt  you  feeling that but when i came i thought i had been mistaken” alexander started up  began  walk up  down  room “no you weren’t mistaken i’ve been up  canada  my bridge  i arranged not  come  new york until after you had gone then when your manager added two more weeks i  already committed” he dropped upon  stool  front  her  sat  his hands hanging between his knees “what am i  do hilda” “that’s what i wanted  see you about bartley i’m going  do what you asked me  do when you   london only i’ll do  more completely i’m going  marry” “who” “oh  doesn’t matter much one  them only not mac i’m too fond  him” alexander moved restlessly “are you joking hilda” “indeed i’m not” “then you don’t know what you’re talking about” “yes i know very well i’ve thought about   great deal  i’ve quite decided i never used  understand how women did things like that but i know now it’s because they can’t    mercy   man they love any longer” alexander flushed angrily “so it’s better     mercy   man you don’t love” “under such circumstances infinitely” there   flash  her eyes  made alexander’s fall he got up  went over   window threw  open  leaned out he heard hilda moving about behind him when  looked over his shoulder she  lacing her boots he went back  stood over her “hilda you’d better think  while longer before you do that i don’t know what i ought  say but i don’t believe you’d  happy truly i don’t aren’t you trying  frighten me” she tied  knot   last lacing  put her bootheel down firmly “no i’m telling you what i’ve made up my mind  do i suppose i would better do  without telling you but afterward i shan’t have  opportunity  explain  i shan’t  seeing you again” alexander started  speak but caught himself when hilda rose  sat down   arm  her chair  drew her back into it “i wouldn’t  so much alarmed if i didn’t know how utterly reckless you can be don’t do anything like  rashly” his face grew troubled “you wouldn’t  happy you  not  kind  woman i’d never have another hour’s peace if i helped  make you do  thing like that” he took her face between his hands  looked down into it “you see you  different hilda don’t you know you are” his voice grew softer his touch more  more tender “some women can do  sort  thing but youyou can love  queens did   old time” hilda had heard  soft deep tone  his voice only once before she closed her eyes her lips  eyelids trembled “only one bartley only one and  threw  back  me  second time” she felt  strength leap   arms  held her so lightly “try him again hilda try him once again” she looked up into his eyes  hid her face  her hands chapter x on tuesday afternoon  boston lawyer who had been trying  case  vermont  standing   siding  white river junction when  canadian express pulled    northward journey as  daycoaches   rear end   long train swept  him  lawyer noticed  one   windows  man’s head  thick rumpled hair “curious”  thought “that looked like alexander but what would   doing back there   daycoaches” it was indeed alexander that morning  telegram  moorlock had reached him telling him  there  serious trouble   bridge     needed there  once so  had caught  first train out  new york he had taken  seat   daycoach  avoid

afterward he seemed  see himself dragging out  restless existence   continentcannes hyeres algiers cairoamong smartly dressed disabled men  every nationality forever going  journeys  led nowhere hurrying  catch trains   might just  well miss getting up   morning   great bustle  splashing  water  begin  day  had no purpose  no meaning dining late  shorten  night sleeping late  shorten  day and  what for  mere folly  masquerade  little thing   could not let go and he could even let it go  told himself but  had promised    london  midsummer   knew   would go    it  impossible  live like this any longer and this then     disaster  his old professor had foreseen  him  crack   wall  crash  cloud  dust and  could not understand how  had come about he felt   himself  unchanged    still there  same man  had been five years ago     sitting stupidly   letting some resolute offshoot  himself spoil his life  him this new force  not he   but  part  him he would not even admit    stronger than he but   more active it    energy  this new feeling got  better  him his wife   woman who had made his life gratified his pride given direction  his tastes  habits the life they led together seemed  him beautiful winifred still was  she had always been romance  him  whenever   deeply stirred  turned  her when  grandeur  beauty   world challenged himas  challenges even  most selfabsorbed peoplehe always answered  her name that  his reply   question put   mountains   stars  all  spiritual aspects  life in his feeling  his wife there  all  tenderness all  pride all  devotion  which   capable there  everything but energy  energy  youth which must register itself  cut  name before  passes this new feeling  so fresh so unsatisfied  light  foot it ran   not wearied anticipated him everywhere it put  girdle round  earth while   going  new york  moorlock at this moment   tingling through him exultant  live  quicksilver whispering “in july you    england” already  dreaded  long empty days  sea  monotonous irish coast  sluggish passage up  mersey  flash   boat train through  summer country he closed his eyes  gave himself up   feeling  rapid motion   swift terrifying thoughts he  sitting so his face shaded  his hand when  boston lawyer saw him   siding  white river junction when  last alexander roused himself  afternoon had waned  sunset the train  passing through  gray country   sky overhead  flushed   wide flood  clear color there   rosecolored light over  gray rocks  hills  meadows off   left under  approach   weatherstained wooden bridge  group  boys  sitting around  little fire the smell   wood smoke blew    window except   old farmer jogging along  highroad  his boxwagon there  not another living creature   seen alexander looked back wistfully   boys camped   edge   little marsh crouching under their shelter  looking gravely  their fire they took his mind back  long way   campfire   sandbar   western river   wished  could go back  sit down  them he could remember exactly how  world had looked then it  quite dark  alexander  still thinking   boys when  occurred  him   train must  nearing allway in going  his new bridge  moorlock  had always  pass through allway the train stopped  allway mills then wound two miles up  river  then  hollow sound under his feet told bartley     his first bridge again the bridge seemed longer than  had ever seemed before    glad when  felt  beat   wheels   solid roadbed again he did not like coming  going across  bridge or remembering  man who built it and  he indeed  same man who used  walk  bridge  night promising such things  himself    stars and yet  could remember  all so well  quiet hills sleeping   moonlight  slender skeleton   bridge reaching out into  river  up yonder alone   hill  big white house upstairs  winifred’s window  light  told him she  still awake  still thinking  him and after  light went out  walked alone taking  heavens into his confidence unable  tear himself away   white magic   night unwilling  sleep because longing  so sweet  him  because   first time since first  hills  hung  moonlight there   lover   world and always there   sound   rushing water underneath  sound which more than anything else meant death  wearing away  things under  impact  physical forces which men could direct but never circumvent or diminish then   exaltation  love more than ever  seemed  him  mean death  only other thing  strong  love under  moon under  cold splendid stars there  only those two things awake  sleepless death  love  rushing river  his burning heart alexander sat up  looked about him the train  tearing  through  darkness all his companions   daycoach  either dozing or sleeping heavily   murky lamps  turned low how came  here among all these dirty people why   going  london what did  meanwhat   answer how could this happen   man who had lived through  magical spring  summer  who had felt   stars themselves  but flaming particles   faraway infinitudes  his love what had  done  lose it how could  endure  baseness  life without it and  every revolution   wheels beneath him  unquiet quicksilver  his breast told him   midsummer  would   london he remembered his last night there  red foggy darkness  hungry crowds before  theatres  handorgans  feverish rhythm   blurred crowded streets   feeling  letting himself go   crowd he shuddered  looked about him   poor unconscious companions  his journey unkempt  travelstained now doubled  unlovely attitudes who had come  stand  him   ugliness  had brought into  world and those boys back there beginning  all just   had begun it  wished  could promise them better luck ah if one could promise any one better luck if one could assure  single human being  happiness he had thought  could do so once    thinking      last fell asleep in his sleep  if  had nothing fresher  work upon his mind went back  tortured itself  something years  years away  old longforgotten sorrow  his childhood when alexander awoke   morning  sun  just rising through pale golden ripples  cloud   fresh yellow light  vibrating through  pine woods the white birches  their little unfolding leaves gleamed   lowlands   marsh meadows  already coming  life  their first green  thin bright color which had run over them like fire as  train rushed along  trestles thousands  wild birds rose screaming into  light the sky  already  pale blue    clearness  crystal bartley caught up his bag  hurried through  pullman coaches until  found  conductor there   stateroom unoccupied   took   set about changing his clothes last night  would not have believed  anything could  so pleasant   cold water  dashed over his head  shoulders   freshness  clean linen  his body after  had dressed alexander sat down   window  drew into his lungs deep breaths   pinescented air he had awakened  all his old sense  power he could not believe  things   bad  him  they had seemed last night  there  no way  set them entirely right even if  went  london  midsummer what would  mean except     fool and  had been  fool before that  not  reality  his life yet  knew   would go  london half  hour later  train stopped  moorlock alexander sprang   platform  hurried up  siding waving  philip horton one  his assistants who  anxiously looking up   windows   coaches bartley took his arm  they went together into  station buffet “i’ll have my coffee first philip have you had yours and now what seems    matter up here” the young man   hurried nervous way began his explanation but alexander cut him short “when did you stop work”  asked sharply the young engineer looked confused “i haven’t stopped work yet mr alexander i didn’t feel  i could go so far without definite authorization  you” “then why didn’t you say  your telegram exactly what you thought  ask  your authorization you’d have got  quick enough” “well really mr alexander i couldn’t  absolutely sure you know  i didn’t like  take  responsibility  making  public” alexander pushed back his chair  rose “anything i do can  made public phil you say  you believe  lower chords  showing strain   even  workmen have been talking about it  yet you’ve gone  adding weight” “i’m sorry mr alexander but i had counted  your getting here yesterday my first telegram missed you somehow i sent one sunday evening   same address but   returned  me” “have you  carriage out there i must stop  send  wire” alexander went up   telegraphdesk  penciled  following message  his wife i may have   here  some time can you come up  once urgent bartley the moorlock bridge lay three miles above  town when they  seated   carriage alexander began  question his assistant further if   true   compression members showed strain   bridge only two thirds done then there  nothing  do but pull  whole structure down  begin over again horton kept repeating    sure there could  nothing wrong   estimates alexander grew impatient “that’s all true phil but we never  justified  assuming   scale   perfectly safe   ordinary bridge would work  anything  such length it’s all very well  paper but  remains   seen whether  can  done  practice i should have thrown up  job when they crowded me it’s all nonsense  try  do what other engineers  doing when you know they’re not sound” “but just now when there  such competition”  younger man demurred “and certainly that’s  new line  development” alexander shrugged his shoulders  made no reply when they reached  bridge works alexander began his examination immediately an hour later  sent   superintendent “i think you had better stop work out there  once dan i should say   lower chord here might buckle  any moment i told  commission  we  using higher unit stresses than any practice  established  we’ve put  dead load   low estimate theoretically  worked out well enough but  had never actually been tried” alexander put  his overcoat  took  superintendent   arm “don’t look so chopfallen dan it’s  jolt but we’ve got  face it it isn’t  end   world you know now we’ll go out  call  men off quietly they’re already nervous horton tells me  there’s no use alarming them i’ll go  you  we’ll send  end riveters  first” alexander   superintendent picked their way out slowly over  long span they went deliberately stopping  see what each gang  doing  if they    ordinary round  inspection when they reached  end   river span alexander nodded   superintendent who quietly gave  order   foreman the men   end gang picked up their tools and glancing curiously  each other started back across  bridge toward  riverbank alexander himself remained standing where they had been working looking about him it  hard  believe   looked back over it   whole great span  incurably disabled  already  good  condemned because something  out  line   lower chord   cantilever arm the end riveters had reached  bank   dispersing among  toolhouses   second gang had picked up their tools   starting toward  shore alexander still standing   end   river span saw  lower chord   cantilever arm give  little like  elbow bending he shouted  ran after  second gang but  this time every one knew   big river span  slowly settling there   burst  shouting   immediately drowned   scream  cracking  tearing iron  all  tension work began  pull asunder once  chords began  buckle there  thousands  tons  ironwork all riveted together  lying  midair without support it tore itself  pieces  roaring  grinding  noises   like  shrieks   steam whistle there  no shock  any kind  bridge had no impetus except   own weight it lurched neither  right nor left but sank almost   vertical line snapping  breaking  tearing   went because no integral part could bear   instant  enormous strain loosed upon it some   men jumped  some ran trying  make  shore at  first shriek   tearing iron alexander jumped   downstream side   bridge he struck  water without injury  disappeared he  under  river  long time  had great difficulty  holding his breath when  seemed impossible  his chest  about  heave  thought  heard his wife telling him   could hold out  little longer an instant later his face cleared  water for  moment   depths   river  had realized what  would mean  die  hypocrite   lie dead under  last abandonment  her tenderness but once   light  air  knew  should live  tell her   recover all  had lost now  last  felt sure  himself he  not startled it seemed  him   had been through something  this sort before there  nothing horrible about it this too  life  life  activity just     boston or  london he  himself  there  something   done everything seemed perfectly natural alexander   strong swimmer but  had gone scarcely  dozen strokes when  bridge itself which had been settling faster  faster crashed into  water behind him immediately  river  full  drowning men a gang  french canadians fell almost  top  him he thought  had cleared them when they began coming up all around him clutching  him   each other some  them could swim but they  either hurt or crazed  fright alexander tried  beat them off but there  too many  them one caught him about  neck another gripped him about  middle  they went down together when  sank his wife seemed   there   water beside him telling him  keep his head  if  could hold out  men would drown  release him there  something  wanted  tell his wife but  could not think clearly   roaring  his ears suddenly  remembered what  was he caught his breath  then she let him go the work  recovering  dead went  all day  all  following night by  next morning fortyeight bodies had been taken out   river but there  still twenty missing many   men had fallen   bridge   held down under  debris early   morning   second day  closed carriage  driven slowly along  riverbank  stopped  little below  works where  river boiled  churned about  great iron carcass which lay   straight line two thirds across it the carriage stood there hour after hour  word soon spread among  crowds   shore   occupant   wife   chief engineer his body had not yet been found the widows   lost workmen moving up  down  bank  shawls over their heads some  them carrying babies looked   rusty hired hack many times  morning they drew near   walked about it but none  them ventured  peer within even halfindifferent sightseers dropped their voices  they told  newcomer “you see  carriage over there that’s mrs alexander they haven’t found him yet she got off  train this morning horton met her she heard   boston yesterdayheard  newsboys crying    street” at noon philip horton made his way through  crowd   tray   tin coffeepot   camp kitchen when  reached  carriage  found mrs alexander just   had left her   early morning leaning forward  little  her hand   lowered window looking   river hour after hour she had been watching  water  lonely useless stone towers   convulsed mass  iron wreckage over which  angry river continually spat up  yellow foam “those poor women out there do they blame him very much” she asked  she handed  coffeecup back  horton “nobody blames him mrs alexander if any one   blame i’m afraid it’s i i should have stopped work before  came he said so  soon  i met him i tried  get him here  day earlier but my telegram missed him somehow he didn’t have time really  explain  me if he’d got here monday he’d have had all  men off  once but you see mrs alexander such  thing never happened before according  all human calculations  simply couldn’t happen” horton leaned wearily against  front wheel   cab he had not had his clothes off  thirty hours   stimulus  violent excitement  beginning  wear off “don’t  afraid  tell me  worst mr horton don’t leave me   dread  finding out things  people may  saying if   blamed if  needs any one  speak  him”for  first time her voice broke   flush  life tearful painful  confused swept over her rigid pallor“if  needs any one tell me show me what  do” she began  sob  horton hurried away when  came back  four o’clock   afternoon   carrying his hat  his hand  winifred knew  soon  she saw him  they had found bartley she opened  carriage door before  reached her  stepped   ground horton put out his hand  if  hold her back  spoke pleadingly “won’t you drive up  my house mrs alexander they  take him up there” “take me  him now please i shall not make any trouble” the group  men down under  riverbank fell back when they saw  woman coming  one  them threw  tarpaulin over  stretcher they took off their hats  caps  winifred approached  although she had pulled her veil down over her face they did not look up  her she  taller than horton  some   men thought she   tallest woman they had ever seen “as tall  himself” some one whispered horton motioned   men  six  them lifted  stretcher  began  carry  up  embankment winifred followed them  halfmile  horton’s house she walked quietly without once breaking or stumbling when  bearers put  stretcher down  horton’s spare bedroom she thanked them  gave her hand  each  turn the men went out   house  through  yard  their caps  their hands they  too much confused  say anything  they went down  hill horton himself  almost  deeply perplexed “mamie”  said  his wife when  came out   spare room half  hour later “will you take mrs alexander  things she needs she  going  do everything herself just stay about where you can hear her  go  if she wants you” everything happened  alexander had foreseen   moment  prescience under  river with her own hands she washed him clean  every mark  disaster all night   alone  her   still house his great head lying deep   pillow in  pocket  his coat winifred found  letter   had written her  night before  left new york watersoaked  illegible but because   length she knew  had been meant  her for alexander death   easy creditor fortune which had smiled upon him consistently all his life did not desert him   end his harshest critics did not doubt that had  lived  would have retrieved himself even lucius wilson did not see  this accident  disaster  had once foretold when  great man dies  his prime there  no surgeon who can say whether  did well whether or not  future  his   seemed  be the mind  society had come  regard   powerful  reliable machine dedicated   service may   long time have been sick within itself  bent upon  own destruction epilogue professor wilson had been living  london  six years    just back   visit  america one afternoon soon after his return  put  his frockcoat  drove   hansom  pay  call upon hilda burgoyne who still lived  her old number off bedford square he  miss burgoyne had been fast friends   long time he had first noticed her about  corridors   british museum where  read constantly her being there so often had made him feel   would like  know her   she  not  inaccessible person  introduction  not difficult the preliminaries once over they came  depend  great deal upon each other  wilson after his day’s reading often went round  bedford square  his tea they had much more  common than their memories   common friend indeed they seldom spoke  him they saved    deep moments which do not come often  then their talk  him  mostly silence wilson knew  hilda had loved him more than this  had not tried  know it  late when wilson reached hilda’s apartment  this particular december afternoon   found her alone she sent  fresh tea  made him comfortable  she had such  knack  making people comfortable “how good you   come back before christmas i quite dreaded  holidays without you you’ve helped me over  good many christmases” she smiled  him gayly “as if you needed me  that but  any rate i needed you how well you  looking my dear  how rested” he peered up  her  his low chair balancing  tips  his long fingers together   judicial manner which had grown  him  years hilda laughed  she carefully poured his cream “that means  i  looking very seedy   end   season doesn’t it well we must show wear  last you know” wilson took  cup gratefully “ah no need  remind  man  seventy who  just been home  find    survived all his contemporaries i  most gently treatedas  sort  precious relic but do you know  made me feel awkward   hanging about still” “seventy never mention   me” hilda looked appreciatively   professor’s alert face  so many kindly lines about  mouth  so many quizzical ones about  eyes “you’ve got  hang about  me you know i can’t even let you go home again you must stay put now  i have you back you’re  realest thing i have” wilson chuckled “dear me am i out  so many conquests   spoils  conquered cities you’ve really missed me well then i shall hang even if you have  last  put me   mummyroom   others you’ll visit me often won’t you” “every day   calendar here your cigarettes   this drawer where you left them” she struck  match  lit one  him “but you did after all enjoy being  home again” “oh yes i found  long railway journeys trying people live  thousand miles apart but i did  thoroughly i  all over  place it   boston i lingered longest” “ah you saw mrs alexander” “often i dined  her  had tea there  dozen different times i should think indeed    see her  i lingered   on i found  i still loved  go   house it always seemed  if bartley  there somehow    any moment one might hear his heavy tramp   stairs do you know i kept feeling   must  up  his study” the professor looked reflectively into  grate “i should really have liked  go up there that  where i had my last long talk  him but mrs alexander never suggested it” “why” wilson   little startled  her tone   turned his head so quickly  his cufflink caught  string  his noseglasses  pulled them awry “why why dear me i don’t know she probably never thought  it” hilda bit her lip “i don’t know what made me say that i didn’t mean  interrupt go  please  tell me how  was” “well   like that almost  if   there in  way  really  there she never lets him go it’s  most beautiful  dignified sorrow i’ve ever known it’s so beautiful     compensations i should think its very completeness   compensation it gives her  fixed star  steer by she doesn’t drift we sat there evening after evening   quiet   magically haunted room  watched  sunset burn   river  felt him felt him   difference  course” hilda leaned forward her elbow  her knee her chin  her hand “with  difference because  her you mean” wilson’s brow wrinkled “something like that yes of course  time goes on  her  becomes more  more their simple personal relation” hilda studied  droop   professor’s head intently “you didn’t altogether like that you felt  wasn’t wholly fair  him” wilson shook himself  readjusted his glasses “oh fair enough more than fair of course i always felt  my image  him  just  little different  hers no relation  so complete   can hold absolutely all   person and i liked him just   was his deviations too  places where  didn’t square” hilda considered vaguely “has she grown much older” she asked  last “yes  no in  tragic way she  even handsomer but colder cold  everything but him forget thyself  marble’ i kept thinking  that her happiness   happiness  deux not apart   world but actually against it and now her grief  like that she saves herself    doesn’t even go through  form  seeing people much i’m sorry it would  better  her  might  so good  them if she could let other people in” “perhaps she’s afraid  letting him out  little  sharing him  somebody” wilson put down his cup  looked up  vague alarm “dear me  takes  woman  think  that now i don’t you know think we ought   hard  her more even than  rest  us she didn’t choose her destiny she underwent it and   left her chilled as  her not wishing  take  world into her confidencewell    pretty brutal  stupid world after all you know” hilda leaned forward “yes i know i know only i can’t help being glad  there  something  him even  stupid  vulgar people my little marie worshiped him when she  dusting i always know when she  come  his picture” wilson nodded “oh yes he left  echo the ripples go   all  us he belonged   people who make  play  most  us  only onlookers   best we shouldn’t wonder too much  mrs alexander she must feel how useless  would   stir about  she may  well sit still  nothing can happen  her after bartley” “yes” said hilda softly “nothing can happen  one after bartley” they both sat looking into  fire  the barrel organ  alfred noyes there’s  barrelorgan caroling across  golden street in  city   sun sinks low and  music’s not immortal but  world  made  sweet and fulfilled    sunset glow and  pulses through  pleasures   city   pain that surround  singing organ like  large eternal light and they’ve given   glory   part  play

changes like  prismatic glass it takes  light  ranges through all  moods  pass dissects  common carnival of passions  regrets and gives  world  glimpse  all the colors  forgets and there la traviata

feet marking time sweet time   dull mechanic beat and  thousand hearts  plunging   love they’ll never meet through  meadows   sunset through  poppies   wheat in  land where  dead dreams go verdi verdi when you wrote il trovatore did you dream of  city when  sun sinks low of  organ   monkey   manycolored stream on  piccadilly pavement   myriad eyes  seem to  litten   moment   wild italian gleam as a che la morte parodies  world’s eternal theme and pulses   sunset glow there’s  thief perhaps  listens   face  frozen stone in  city   sun sinks low there’s  portly man  business   balance  his own there’s  clerk  there’s  butcher   soft reposeful tone and they’re all them returning   heavens they have known they  crammed  jammed  busses andthey’re each  them alone in  land where  dead dreams go there’s  very modish woman  her smile  very bland in  city   sun sinks low and her hansom jingles onward but her little jeweled hand is clenched  little tighter  she cannot understand what she wants or why she wanders   undiscovered land for  parties there  not  all  sort  thing she planned in  land where  dead dreams go there’s  oxford man  listens  his heart  crying out in  city   sun sinks low for  barge  eight  isis   coach’s whoop  shout for  minute gun  counting   long disheveled rout for  howl along  towpath   fate that’s still  doubt for  roughened oar  handle   race  think about in  land where  dead dreams go there’s  laborer  listen   voices   dead in  city   sun sinks low and his hand begins  tremble  his face  rather red as  sees  loafer watching him andthere  turns his head and stares into  sunset where his april love  fled for  hears her softly singing  his lonely soul  led through  land where  dead dreams go there’s  old  hardened demirep it’s ringing  her ears in  city   sun sinks low with  wild  empty sorrow   love  blights  sears oh  if she hurries onward then  sure  sure she hears hears  bears  bitter burden   unforgotten years and her laugh’s  little harsher  her eyes  brimmed  tears for  land where  dead dreams go there’s  barrelorgan caroling across  golden street in  city   sun sinks low though  music’s only verdi there’s  world  make  sweet just  yonder yellow sunset where  earth  heaven meet mellows all  sooty city hark  hundred thousand feet are marching   glory through  poppies   wheat in  land where  dead dreams go so it’s jeremiah jeremiah what have you  say when you meet  garland girls tripping  their way all around my gala hat i wear  wreath  roses a long  lonely year   i’ve waited   may if any one should ask you the reason why i wear  is my own love my true love  coming home today it’s buy  bunch  violets   lady it’s lilac time in london it’s lilac time in london buy  bunch  violets   lady while  sky burns blue above on  other side   street you’ll find  shady it’s lilac time in london it’s lilac time in london but buy  bunch  violets   lady and tell her she’s your own true love there’s  barrelorgan caroling across  golden street in  city   sun sinks glittering  slow and  music’s not immortal but  world  made  sweet and enriched    harmonies  make  song complete in  deeper heavens  music where  night  morning meet as  dies into  sunset glow and  pulses through  pleasures   city   pain that surround  singing organ like  large eternal light and they’ve given   glory   part  play again in  symphony  rules  day  night and there   music changes the song runs round again once more  turns  ranges through all  joy  pain dissects  common carnival of passions  regrets and  wheeling world remembers all the wheeling song forgets once more la traviata sighs another sadder song once more il trovatore cries a tale  deeper wrong once more  knights  battle go with sword  shield  lance till once once more  shattered foe has whirled intoa dance come down  kew  lilac time  lilac time  lilac time come down  kew  lilac time it isn’t far  london and you shall wander hand  hand  love  summer’s wonderland come
