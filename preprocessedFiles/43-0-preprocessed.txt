lawyer    other side   bystreet but when they came abreast   entry  former lifted up his cane  pointed “did you ever remark  door”  asked  when his companion had replied   affirmative “it  connected  my mind” added he “with  very odd story” “indeed” said mr utterson   slight change  voice “and what  that” “well   this way” returned mr enfield “i  coming home  some place   end   world about three o’clock   black winter morning  my way lay through  part  town where there  literally nothing   seen but lamps street after street  all  folks asleep—street after street all lighted up  if   procession  all  empty   church—till  last i got into  state  mind when  man listens  listens  begins  long   sight   policeman all  once i saw two figures one  little man who  stumping along eastward   good walk   other  girl  maybe eight or ten who  running  hard  she  able down  cross street well sir  two ran into one another naturally enough   corner  then came  horrible part   thing   man trampled calmly over  child’s body  left her screaming   ground it sounds nothing  hear but   hellish  see it wasn’t like  man   like some damned juggernaut i gave  few halloa took  my heels collared my gentleman  brought him back  where there  already quite  group about  screaming child he  perfectly cool  made no resistance but gave me one look so ugly   brought out  sweat  me like running the people who had turned out   girl’s own family  pretty soon  doctor  whom she had been sent put  his appearance well  child  not much  worse more frightened according   sawbones  there you might have supposed would   end  it but there  one curious circumstance i had taken  loathing  my gentleman  first sight so had  child’s family which  only natural but  doctor’s case  what struck me he   usual cut  dry apothecary  no particular age  colour   strong edinburgh accent  about  emotional   bagpipe well sir   like  rest  us every time  looked  my prisoner i saw  sawbones turn sick  white   desire  kill him i knew what   his mind just   knew what   mine  killing being out   question we did  next best we told  man we could  would make such  scandal out  this  should make his name stink  one end  london   other if  had any friends or any credit we undertook   should lose them and all  time  we  pitching   red hot we  keeping  women off him  best we could  they   wild  harpies i never saw  circle  such hateful faces  there   man   middle   kind  black sneering coolness—frightened too i could see that—but carrying  off sir really like satan ‘if you choose  make capital out  this accident’ said he ‘i am naturally helpless no gentleman but wishes  avoid  scene’ says he ‘name your figure’ well we screwed him up   hundred pounds   child’s family  would have clearly liked  stick out but there  something about  lot  us  meant mischief   last  struck the next thing   get  money  where do you think  carried us but   place   door—whipped out  key went in  presently came back   matter  ten pounds  gold   cheque   balance  coutts’s drawn payable  bearer  signed   name  i can’t mention though it’s one   points  my story but    name  least very well known  often printed the figure  stiff but  signature  good  more than  if   only genuine i took  liberty  pointing out  my gentleman   whole business looked apocryphal    man does not  real life walk into  cellar door  four   morning  come out  another man’s cheque  close upon  hundred pounds but   quite easy  sneering ‘set your mind  rest’ says he ‘i  stay  you till  banks open  cash  cheque myself’ so we all set off  doctor   child’s father  our friend  myself  passed  rest   night  my chambers  next day when we had breakfasted went   body   bank i gave   cheque myself  said i had every reason  believe    forgery not  bit  it the cheque  genuine” “tuttut” said mr utterson “i see you feel  i do” said mr enfield “yes it’s  bad story for my man   fellow  nobody could have  do with  really damnable man   person  drew  cheque   very pink   proprieties celebrated too  what makes  worse one  your fellows who do what they call good blackmail i suppose  honest man paying through  nose  some   capers  his youth black mail house  what i call  place   door  consequence though even that you know  far  explaining all”  added    words fell into  vein  musing from this   recalled  mr utterson asking rather suddenly “and you don’t know if  drawer   cheque lives there” “a likely place isn’t it” returned mr enfield “but i happen  have noticed his address  lives  some square or other” “and you never asked about the—place   door” said mr utterson “no sir i had  delicacy”   reply “i feel very strongly about putting questions  partakes too much   style   day  judgment you start  question  it’s like starting  stone you sit quietly   top   hill  away  stone goes starting others  presently some bland old bird the last you would have thought of  knocked   head  his own back garden   family have  change their name no sir i make   rule  mine  more  looks like queer street  less i ask” “a very good rule too” said  lawyer “but i have studied  place  myself” continued mr enfield “it seems scarcely  house there  no other door  nobody goes  or out   one but once   great while  gentleman  my adventure there  three windows looking   court   first floor none below  windows  always shut but they’re clean and then there   chimney which  generally smoking so somebody must live there and yet it’s not so sure   buildings  so packed together about  court  it’s hard  say where one ends  another begins” the pair walked  again   while  silence  then “enfield” said mr utterson “that’s  good rule  yours” “yes i think  is” returned enfield “but  all that” continued  lawyer “there’s one point i want  ask i want  ask  name   man who walked over  child” “well” said mr enfield “i can’t see what harm  would do it   man   name  hyde” “hm” said mr utterson “what sort   man    see” “he  not easy  describe there  something wrong  his appearance something displeasing something downright detestable i never saw  man i so disliked  yet i scarce know why he must  deformed somewhere  gives  strong feeling  deformity although i couldn’t specify  point he’s  extraordinary looking man  yet i really can name nothing out   way no sir i can make no hand  it i can’t describe him and it’s not want  memory  i declare i can see him this moment” mr utterson again walked some way  silence  obviously under  weight  consideration “you  sure  used  key”  inquired  last “my dear sir” began enfield surprised out  himself “yes i know” said utterson “i know  must seem strange the fact is if i do not ask you  name   other party   because i know  already you see richard your tale  gone home if you have been inexact  any point you had better correct it” “i think you might have warned me” returned  other   touch  sullenness “but i have been pedantically exact  you call it the fellow had  key  what’s more    still i saw him use  not  week ago” mr utterson sighed deeply but said never  word   young man presently resumed “here  another lesson  say nothing” said he “i am ashamed  my long tongue let us make  bargain never  refer  this again” “with all my heart” said  lawyer “i shake hands  that richard” search for mr hyde that evening mr utterson came home  his bachelor house  sombre

unexplained absence  any period exceeding three calendar months”  said edward hyde should step into  said henry jekyll’s shoes without further delay  free  any burthen or obligation beyond  payment   few small sums   members   doctor’s household this document had long been  lawyer’s eyesore it offended him both   lawyer    lover   sane  customary sides  life  whom  fanciful   immodest and hitherto

his wine this   hearty healthy dapper redfaced gentleman   shock  hair prematurely white   boisterous  decided manner at sight  mr utterson  sprang up  his chair  welcomed him  both hands the geniality    way   man  somewhat theatrical   eye but  reposed  genuine feeling for these two  old friends old mates both  school  college both thorough respectors  themselves   each other  what does not always follow men who thoroughly enjoyed each other’s company after  little rambling talk  lawyer led up   subject which so disagreeably preoccupied his mind “i suppose lanyon” said he “you  i must   two oldest friends  henry jekyll has” “i wish  friends  younger” chuckled dr lanyon “but i suppose we are and what  that i see little  him now” “indeed” said utterson “i thought you had  bond  common interest” “we had”   reply “but   more than ten years since henry jekyll became too fanciful  me he began  go wrong wrong  mind  though  course i continue  take  interest  him  old sake’s sake  they say i see  i have seen devilish little   man such unscientific balderdash” added  doctor flushing suddenly purple “would have estranged damon  pythias” this little spirit  temper  somewhat   relief  mr utterson “they have only differed  some point  science”  thought  being  man  no scientific passions except   matter  conveyancing  even added “it  nothing worse than that” he gave his friend  few seconds  recover his composure  then approached  question  had come  put “did you ever come across  protégé  his—one hyde”  asked “hyde” repeated lanyon “no never heard  him since my time” that   amount  information   lawyer carried back  him   great dark bed  which  tossed   fro until  small hours   morning began  grow large it   night  little ease  his toiling mind toiling  mere darkness  besieged  questions six o’clock struck   bells   church   so conveniently near  mr utterson’s dwelling  still   digging   problem hitherto  had touched him   intellectual side alone but now his imagination also  engaged or rather enslaved    lay  tossed   gross darkness   night   curtained room mr enfield’s tale went  before his mind   scroll  lighted pictures he would  aware   great

plenty  time scarce  night under  face   fogged city moon  all lights   all hours  solitude or concourse  lawyer    found  his chosen post “if   mr hyde”  had thought “i shall  mr seek” and  last his patience  rewarded it   fine dry night frost   air  streets  clean   ballroom floor  lamps unshaken  any wind drawing  regular pattern  light  shadow by ten o’clock when  shops  closed  bystreet  very solitary and  spite   low growl  london  all round very silent small sounds carried far domestic sounds out   houses  clearly audible  either side   roadway   rumour   approach  any passenger preceded

prevision  success   withdrew into  entry   court the steps drew swiftly nearer  swelled out suddenly louder  they turned  end   street the lawyer looking forth   entry could soon see what manner  man  had  deal with he  small  very plainly dressed   look  him even   distance went somehow strongly against  watcher’s inclination but  made straight   door crossing  roadway  save time    came  drew  key  his pocket like one approaching home mr utterson stepped out  touched him   shoulder   passed “mr hyde i think” mr hyde shrank back   hissing intake   breath but his fear  only momentary  though  did not look  lawyer   face  answered coolly enough “that  my name what do you want” “i see you  going in” returned  lawyer “i am  old friend  dr jekyll’s—mr utterson  gaunt street—you must have heard  my name  meeting you so conveniently i thought you might admit me” “you  not find dr jekyll    home” replied mr hyde blowing   key and then suddenly but still without looking up “how did you know me”  asked “on your side” said mr utterson “will you do me  favour” “with pleasure” replied  other “what shall  be” “will you let me see your face” asked  lawyer mr hyde appeared  hesitate  then  if upon some sudden reflection fronted about   air  defiance   pair stared  each other pretty fixedly   few seconds “now i shall know you again” said mr utterson “it may  useful” “yes” returned mr hyde “it   well we have met  à propos you should have my address” and  gave  number   street  soho “good god” thought mr utterson “can he too have been thinking   will” but  kept his feelings  himself  only grunted  acknowledgment   address “and now” said  other “how did you know me” “by description”   reply “whose description” “we have common friends” said mr utterson “common friends” echoed mr hyde  little hoarsely “who  they” “jekyll  instance” said  lawyer “he never told you” cried mr hyde   flush  anger “i did not think you would have lied” “come” said mr utterson “that  not fitting language” the other snarled aloud into  savage laugh   next moment  extraordinary quickness  had unlocked  door  disappeared into  house the lawyer stood awhile when mr hyde had left him  picture  disquietude then  began slowly  mount  street pausing every step or two  putting his hand  his brow like  man  mental perplexity the problem   thus debating   walked  one   class   rarely solved mr hyde  pale  dwarfish  gave  impression  deformity without any nameable malformation  had  displeasing smile  had borne himself   lawyer   sort  murderous mixture  timidity  boldness   spoke   husky whispering  somewhat broken voice all these  points against him but not all  these together could explain  hitherto unknown disgust loathing  fear  which mr utterson regarded him “there must  something else” said  perplexed gentleman “there is something more if i could find  name  it god bless me  man seems hardly human something troglodytic shall we say or can    old story  dr fell or    mere radiance   foul

welldressed elderly servant opened  door “is dr jekyll  home poole” asked  lawyer “i  see mr utterson” said poole admitting  visitor   spoke into  large lowroofed comfortable hall paved  flags warmed

“goodnight mr utterson” and  lawyer set out homeward   very heavy heart “poor harry jekyll”  thought “my mind misgives me    deep waters he  wild when   young  long while ago   sure but   law  god there  no statute  limitations ay  must  that  ghost  some old sin  cancer  some concealed disgrace punishment coming pede claudo years after memory  forgotten  selflove condoned  fault” and  lawyer

former subject  conceived  spark  hope “this master hyde if   studied” thought he “must have secrets  his own black secrets   look  him secrets compared  which poor jekyll’s worst would  like sunshine things cannot continue  they are it turns me cold  think  this creature stealing like  thief  harry’s bedside poor harry what  wakening and  danger  it  if this hyde suspects  existence   will  may grow impatient  inherit ay i must put my shoulders   wheel—if jekyll  but let me”  added “if jekyll  only let me” for once more  saw before his mind’s eye  clear  transparency  strange clauses   will

could see  his looks   cherished  mr utterson  sincere  warm affection “i have been wanting  speak  you jekyll” began  latter “you know    yours” a close observer might have gathered   topic  distasteful but  doctor carried  off gaily “my poor utterson” said he “you  unfortunate  such  client i never saw  man so distressed  you   my will unless    hidebound pedant lanyon  what  called my scientific heresies o i know he’s  good fellow—you needn’t frown—an excellent fellow  i always mean  see more  him but  hidebound pedant  all that  ignorant blatant pedant i  never more disappointed  any man than lanyon” “you know i never approved  it” pursued utterson ruthlessly disregarding  fresh topic “my will yes certainly i know that” said  doctor  trifle sharply “you have told me so” “well i tell you so again” continued  lawyer “i have been learning something  young hyde” the large handsome face  dr jekyll grew pale   very lips  there came  blackness about his eyes “i do not care  hear more” said he “this   matter i thought we had agreed  drop” “what i heard  abominable” said utterson “it can make no change you do not understand my position” returned  doctor   certain incoherency

clean breast  this  confidence  i make no doubt i can get you out  it” “my good utterson” said  doctor “this  very good  you this  downright good  you  i cannot find words  thank you in i believe you fully i would trust you before any man alive ay before myself if i could make  choice but indeed  isn’t what you fancy   not  bad  that  just  put your good heart  rest i  tell you one thing  moment i choose i can  rid  mr hyde i give you my hand upon that  i thank you again  again  i  just add one little word utterson  i’m sure you’ll take  good part this   private matter  i beg  you  let  sleep” utterson reflected  little looking   fire “i have no doubt you  perfectly right”  said  last getting  his feet “well but since we have touched upon this business    last time i hope” continued  doctor “there  one point i should like you  understand i have really  very great interest  poor hyde i know you have seen him  told me so  i fear   rude but i do sincerely take  great  very great interest   young man  if i am taken away utterson i wish you  promise me  you  bear  him  get his rights  him i think you would if you knew all   would   weight off my mind if you would promise” “i can’t pretend  i shall ever like him” said  lawyer “i don’t ask that” pleaded jekyll laying his hand upon  other’s arm “i only ask  justice i only ask you  help him  my sake when i am no longer here” utterson heaved  irrepressible sigh “well” said he “i promise” the carew murder case nearly  year later   month  october — london  startled   crime  singular ferocity  rendered all  more notable   high

possible” and  next moment his eye lighted up  professional ambition “this  make  deal  noise”  said “and perhaps you can help us   man” and  briefly narrated what  maid had seen  showed  broken stick mr utterson had already quailed   name  hyde but when  stick  laid before him  could doubt no longer broken  battered   was  recognised   one   had himself presented many years before  henry jekyll “is this mr hyde  person  small stature”  inquired “particularly small  particularly wickedlooking  what  maid calls him” said  officer mr utterson reflected  then raising his head “if you  come  me  my cab”  said “i think i can take you  his house” it   this time about nine   morning   first fog   season a great chocolatecoloured pall lowered over heaven but  wind  continually charging  routing these embattled vapours so    cab crawled  street  street mr utterson beheld  marvelous number  degrees  hues  twilight  here  would  dark like  backend  evening  there would   glow   rich lurid brown

glimpses   muddy ways  slatternly passengers   lamps which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh  combat this mournful reinvasion  darkness seemed   lawyer’s eyes like  district  some

this   home  henry jekyll’s favourite   man who  heir   quarter   million sterling an ivoryfaced  silveryhaired old woman opened  door she had  evil face smoothed  hypocrisy but her manners  excellent yes she said this  mr hyde’s but   not  home  had been   night very late but  had gone away again  less than  hour there  nothing strange  that his habits  very irregular    often absent  instance   nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday “very well then we wish  see his rooms” said  lawyer  when  woman began  declare   impossible “i had better tell you who this person is”  added “this  inspector newcomen  scotland yard” a flash  odious joy appeared upon  woman’s face “ah” said she “he   trouble what   done” mr utterson   inspector exchanged glances “he don’t seem  very popular character” observed  latter “and now my good woman just let me  this gentleman have  look about us” in  whole extent   house which but   old woman remained otherwise empty mr hyde had only used  couple  rooms but these  furnished  luxury  good taste a closet  filled  wine  plate   silver  napery elegant  good picture hung upon  walls  gift as utterson supposed  henry jekyll who  much   connoisseur   carpets   many plies  agreeable  colour at this moment however  rooms bore every mark  having been recently  hurriedly ransacked clothes lay about  floor  their pockets inside out lockfast drawers stood open    hearth there lay  pile  grey ashes  though many papers had been burned from these embers  inspector disinterred  butt end   green cheque book which had resisted  action   fire  other half   stick  found behind  door   this clinched his suspicions  officer declared himself delighted a visit   bank where several thousand pounds  found   lying   murderer’s credit completed his gratification “you may depend upon it sir”  told mr utterson “i have him  my hand he must have lost his head or  never would have left  stick or above all burned  cheque book why money’s life   man we have nothing  do but wait  him   bank  get out  handbills” this last however  not so easy  accomplishment  mr hyde had numbered few familiars—even  master   servant maid had only seen him twice his family could nowhere  traced  had never been photographed   few who could describe him differed widely  common observers will only  one point  they agreed     haunting sense  unexpressed deformity  which  fugitive impressed his beholders incident of the letter it  late   afternoon when mr utterson found his way  dr jekyll’s door where    once admitted  poole  carried down   kitchen offices  across  yard which had once been  garden   building which  indifferently known   laboratory or dissecting rooms the doctor had bought  house   heirs   celebrated surgeon  his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical had changed  destination   block   bottom   garden it   first time   lawyer had been received   part  his friend’s quarters   eyed  dingy windowless structure

chimney shelf  even   houses  fog began  lie thickly  there close up   warmth sat dr jekyll looking deathly sick he did not rise  meet his visitor but held out  cold hand  bade him welcome   changed voice “and now” said mr utterson  soon  poole had left them “you have heard  news” the doctor shuddered “they  crying    square”  said “i heard them  my diningroom” “one word” said  lawyer “carew  my client but so  you  i want  know what i am doing you have not been mad enough  hide this fellow” “utterson i swear  god” cried  doctor “i swear  god i  never set eyes  him again i bind my honour  you  i am done  him  this world it  all   end and indeed  does not want my help you do not know him  i do   safe   quite safe mark my words   never more  heard of” the lawyer listened gloomily  did not like his friend’s feverish manner “you seem pretty sure  him” said he “and  your sake i hope you may  right if  came   trial your name might appear” “i am quite sure  him” replied jekyll “i have grounds  certainty  i cannot share  any one but there  one thing  which you may advise me i have—i have received  letter  i am   loss whether i should show    police i should like  leave   your hands utterson you would judge wisely i am sure i have so great  trust  you” “you fear i suppose   might lead  his detection” asked  lawyer “no” said  other “i cannot say  i care what becomes  hyde i am quite done  him i  thinking  my own character which this hateful business  rather exposed” utterson ruminated awhile   surprised  his friend’s selfishness  yet relieved  it “well” said he  last “let me see  letter” the letter  written   odd upright hand  signed “edward hyde”   signified briefly enough   writer’s benefactor dr jekyll whom  had long so unworthily repaid   thousand generosities need labour under no alarm  his safety   had means  escape  which  placed  sure dependence the lawyer liked this letter well enough  put  better colour   intimacy than  had looked for   blamed himself  some  his past suspicions “have you  envelope”  asked “i burned it” replied jekyll “before i thought what i  about but  bore no postmark the note  handed in” “shall i keep this  sleep upon it” asked utterson “i wish you  judge  me entirely”   reply “i have lost confidence  myself” “well i shall consider” returned  lawyer “and now one word more   hyde who dictated  terms  your  about  disappearance” the doctor seemed seized   qualm  faintness  shut his mouth tight  nodded “i knew it” said utterson “he meant  murder you you had  fine escape” “i have had what  far more   purpose” returned  doctor solemnly “i have had  lesson—o god utterson what  lesson i have had” and  covered his face   moment  his hands on his way out  lawyer stopped  had  word or two  poole “by  bye” said he “there   letter handed  today what   messenger like” but poole  positive nothing had come except  post “and only circulars  that”  added this news sent off  visitor  his fears renewed plainly

could scarce have failed  hear  mr hyde’s familiarity about  house  might draw conclusions   not  well then   should see  letter which put  mystery  right  above all since guest being  great student  critic  handwriting would consider  step natural  obliging the clerk besides   man  counsel  could scarce read so strange  document without dropping  remark    remark mr utterson might shape his future course “this   sad business about sir danvers”  said “yes sir indeed it  elicited  great deal  public feeling” returned guest “the man  course  mad” “i should like  hear your views  that” replied utterson “i have  document here  his handwriting   between ourselves  i scarce know what  do about it    ugly business   best but there  is quite  your way  murderer’s autograph” guest’s eyes brightened   sat down  once  studied   passion “no sir”  said “not mad but    odd hand” “and  all accounts  very odd writer” added  lawyer just then  servant entered   note “is   dr jekyll sir” inquired  clerk “i thought i knew  writing anything private mr utterson” “only  invitation  dinner why do you want  see it” “one moment i thank you sir”   clerk laid  two sheets  paper alongside  sedulously compared their contents “thank you sir”  said  last returning both “it’s  very interesting autograph” there   pause during which mr utterson struggled  himself “why did you compare them guest”  inquired suddenly “well sir” returned  clerk “there’s  rather singular resemblance  two hands   many points identical only differently sloped” “rather quaint” said utterson “it is  you say rather quaint” returned guest “i wouldn’t speak  this note you know” said  master “no sir” said  clerk “i understand” but no sooner  mr utterson alone  night than  locked  note into his safe where  reposed   time forward “what”  thought “henry jekyll forge   murderer” and his blood ran cold  his veins incident of dr lanyon time ran on thousands  pounds  offered  reward   death  sir danvers  resented   public injury but mr hyde had disappeared out   ken   police  though  had never existed much  his past  unearthed indeed  all disreputable tales came out   man’s cruelty  once so callous  violent  his vile life  his strange associates   hatred  seemed  have surrounded his career but  his present whereabouts not  whisper from  time  had left  house  soho   morning   murder   simply blotted out  gradually  time drew on mr utterson began  recover   hotness  his alarm   grow more  quiet  himself the death  sir danvers was  his way  thinking more than paid    disappearance  mr hyde now   evil influence had been withdrawn  new life began  dr jekyll he came out  his seclusion renewed relations  his friends became once more their familiar guest  entertainer  whilst  had always been

on  th  january utterson had dined   doctor’s   small party lanyon had been there   face   host had looked  one   other    old days when  trio  inseparable friends on  th  again   th  door  shut against  lawyer “the doctor  confined   house” poole said “and saw no one” on  th  tried again   again refused  having now been used   last two months  see his friend almost daily  found this return  solitude  weigh upon his spirits the fifth night  had  guest  dine  him   sixth  betook himself  dr lanyon’s there  least   not denied admittance but when  came in   shocked   change which had taken place   doctor’s appearance he had his deathwarrant written legibly upon his face the rosy man had grown pale his flesh had fallen away   visibly balder  older  yet   not so much these tokens   swift physical decay  arrested  lawyer’s notice   look   eye  quality  manner  seemed  testify  some deepseated terror   mind it  unlikely   doctor should fear death  yet   what utterson  tempted  suspect “yes”  thought “he   doctor  must know his own state   his days  counted   knowledge  more than  can bear” and yet when utterson remarked  his ill looks     air  great firmness  lanyon declared himself  doomed man “i have had  shock”  said “and i shall never recover it   question  weeks well life  been pleasant i liked it yes sir i used  like it i sometimes think if we knew all we should  more glad  get away” “jekyll  ill too” observed utterson “have you seen him” but lanyon’s face changed   held up  trembling hand “i wish  see or hear no more  dr jekyll”  said   loud unsteady voice “i am quite done   person  i beg  you  spare me any allusion  one whom i regard  dead” “tut tut” said mr utterson  then after  considerable pause “can’t i do anything”  inquired “we  three very old friends lanyon we shall not live  make others” “nothing can  done” returned lanyon “ask himself” “he  not see me” said  lawyer “i am not surprised  that”   reply “some day utterson after i am dead you may perhaps come  learn  right  wrong  this i cannot tell you and   meantime if you can sit  talk  me  other things  god’s sake stay  do so but if you cannot keep clear  this accursed topic then  god’s name go  i cannot bear it” as soon   got home utterson sat down  wrote  jekyll complaining  his exclusion   house  asking  cause  this unhappy break  lanyon   next day brought him  long answer often very pathetically worded  sometimes darkly mysterious  drift the quarrel  lanyon  incurable “i do not blame our old friend” jekyll wrote “but i share his view  we must never meet i mean  henceforth  lead  life  extreme seclusion you must not  surprised nor must you doubt my friendship if my door  often shut even  you you must suffer me  go my own dark way i have brought  myself  punishment   danger  i cannot name if i am  chief  sinners i am  chief  sufferers also i could not think  this earth contained  place  sufferings  terrors so unmanning  you can do but one thing utterson  lighten this destiny     respect my silence” utterson  amazed  dark influence  hyde had been withdrawn  doctor had returned  his old tasks  amities  week ago  prospect had smiled  every promise   cheerful   honoured age  now   moment friendship  peace  mind   whole tenor  his life  wrecked so great  unprepared  change pointed  madness but  view  lanyon’s manner  words there must lie   some deeper ground a week afterwards dr lanyon took  his bed   something less than  fortnight   dead the night after  funeral  which  had been sadly affected utterson locked  door  his business room  sitting there   light   melancholy candle drew out  set before him  envelope addressed   hand  sealed   seal  his dead friend “private   hands  g j utterson alone   case  his predecease to  destroyed unread” so   emphatically superscribed   lawyer dreaded  behold  contents “i have buried one friend today”  thought “what if this should cost me another” and then  condemned  fear   disloyalty  broke  seal within there  another enclosure likewise sealed  marked upon  cover  “not   opened till  death or disappearance  dr henry jekyll” utterson could not trust his eyes yes   disappearance here again    mad  which  had long ago restored   author here again   idea   disappearance   name  henry jekyll bracketted but   will  idea had sprung   sinister suggestion   man hyde   set there   purpose all

surviving friend   same eagerness he thought  him kindly but his thoughts  disquieted  fearful he went  call indeed but   perhaps relieved   denied admittance perhaps  his heart  preferred  speak  poole upon  doorstep  surrounded   air  sounds   open city rather than   admitted into  house  voluntary bondage   sit  speak   inscrutable recluse poole had indeed no very pleasant news  communicate the doctor  appeared now more than ever confined himself   cabinet over  laboratory where  would sometimes even sleep   out  spirits  had grown very silent  did not read  seemed  if  had something  his mind utterson became so used   unvarying character  these reports   fell off little  little   frequency  his visits incident at the window it chanced  sunday when mr utterson   his usual walk  mr enfield  their way lay once again through  bystreet   when they came  front   door both stopped  gaze  it “well” said enfield “that story’s   end  least we shall never see more  mr hyde” “i hope not” said utterson “did i ever tell you  i once saw him  shared your feeling  repulsion” “it  impossible  do  one without  other” returned enfield “and   way what  ass you must have thought me not  know  this   back way  dr jekyll’s it  partly your own fault  i found  out even when i did” “so you found  out did you” said utterson “but if   so we may step into  court  take  look   windows to tell you  truth i am uneasy about poor jekyll  even outside i feel  if  presence   friend might do him good” the court  very cool   little damp  full  premature twilight although  sky high up overhead  still bright  sunset the middle one   three windows  halfway open  sitting close beside it taking  air   infinite sadness  mien like some disconsolate prisoner utterson saw dr jekyll “what jekyll”  cried “i trust you  better” “i am very low utterson” replied  doctor drearily “very low it  not last long thank god” “you stay too much indoors” said  lawyer “you should  out whipping up  circulation like mr enfield  me this  my cousin—mr enfield—dr jekyll come now get your hat  take  quick turn  us” “you  very good” sighed  other “i should like  very much but no no no   quite impossible i dare not but indeed utterson i am very glad  see you this  really  great pleasure i would ask you  mr enfield up but  place  really not fit” “why then” said  lawyer goodnaturedly “the best thing we can do   stay down here  speak  you  where we are” “that  just what i  about  venture  propose” returned  doctor   smile but  words  hardly uttered before  smile  struck out  his face  succeeded   expression  such abject terror  despair  froze  very blood   two gentlemen below they saw  but   glimpse   window  instantly thrust down but  glimpse had been sufficient  they turned  left  court without  word in silence too they traversed  bystreet    not until they had come into  neighbouring thoroughfare where even upon  sunday there  still some stirrings  life  mr utterson  last turned  looked  his companion they  both pale  there   answering horror  their eyes “god forgive us god forgive us” said mr utterson but mr enfield only nodded his head very seriously  walked  once more  silence the last night mr utterson  sitting  his fireside one evening after dinner when   surprised  receive  visit  poole “bless me poole what brings you here”  cried  then taking  second look  him “what ails you”  added “is  doctor ill” “mr utterson” said  man “there  something wrong” “take  seat  here   glass  wine  you” said  lawyer “now take your time  tell me plainly what you want” “you know  doctor’s ways sir” replied poole “and how  shuts himself up well he’s shut up again   cabinet  i don’t like it sir—i wish i may die if i like it mr utterson sir i’m afraid” “now my good man” said  lawyer “be explicit what  you afraid of” “i’ve been afraid  about  week” returned poole doggedly disregarding  question “and i can bear  no more” the man’s appearance amply bore out his words his manner  altered   worse  except   moment when  had first announced his terror  had not once looked  lawyer   face even now  sat   glass  wine untasted  his knee  his eyes directed   corner   floor “i can bear  no more”  repeated “come” said  lawyer “i see you have some good reason poole i see there  something seriously amiss try  tell me what  is” “i think there’s been foul play” said poole hoarsely “foul play” cried  lawyer  good deal frightened  rather inclined   irritated  consequence “what foul play what does  man mean” “i daren’t say sir”   answer “but  you come along  me  see  yourself” mr utterson’s only answer   rise  get his hat  greatcoat but  observed  wonder  greatness   relief  appeared upon  butler’s face  perhaps  no less   wine  still untasted when  set  down  follow it   wild cold seasonable night  march   pale moon lying  her back  though  wind had tilted her  flying wrack   most diaphanous  lawny texture the wind made talking difficult  flecked  blood into  face it seemed  have swept  streets unusually bare  passengers besides  mr utterson thought  had never seen  part  london so deserted he could have wished  otherwise never  his life had  been conscious  so sharp  wish  see  touch his fellowcreatures  struggle   might there  borne  upon his mind  crushing anticipation  calamity the square when they got there  full  wind  dust   thin trees   garden  lashing themselves along  railing poole who had kept all  way  pace or two ahead now pulled up   middle   pavement   spite   biting weather took off his hat  mopped his brow   red pockethandkerchief but  all  hurry  his coming these  not  dews  exertion   wiped away but  moisture  some strangling anguish  his face  white  his voice when  spoke harsh  broken “well sir”  said “here we are  god grant there  nothing wrong” “amen poole” said  lawyer thereupon  servant knocked   very guarded manner  door  opened   chain   voice asked  within “is  you poole” “it’s all right” said poole “open  door” the hall when they entered it  brightly lighted up  fire  built high  about  hearth  whole   servants men  women stood huddled together like  flock  sheep at  sight  mr utterson  housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering   cook crying out “bless god it’s mr utterson” ran forward  if  take him  her arms “what what are you all here” said  lawyer peevishly “very irregular very unseemly your master would  far  pleased” “they’re all afraid” said poole blank silence followed no one protesting only  maid lifted her voice  now wept loudly “hold your tongue” poole said  her   ferocity  accent  testified  his own jangled nerves  indeed when  girl had so suddenly raised  note  her lamentation they had all started  turned towards  inner door  faces  dreadful expectation “and now” continued  butler addressing  knifeboy “reach me  candle  we’ll get this through hands  once” and then  begged mr utterson  follow him  led  way   back garden “now sir” said he “you come  gently  you can i want you  hear  i don’t want you   heard and see here sir if  any chance    ask you in don’t go” mr utterson’s nerves  this unlookedfor termination gave  jerk  nearly threw him  his balance but  recollected his courage  followed  butler into  laboratory building through  surgical theatre   lumber  crates  bottles   foot   stair here poole motioned him  stand  one side  listen while  himself setting down  candle  making  great  obvious call  his resolution mounted  steps  knocked   somewhat uncertain hand   red baize   cabinet door “mr utterson sir asking  see you”  called  even   did so once more violently signed   lawyer  give ear a voice answered  within “tell him i cannot see anyone”  said complainingly “thank you sir” said poole   note  something like triumph  his voice  taking up his candle  led mr utterson back across  yard  into  great kitchen where  fire  out   beetles  leaping   floor “sir”  said looking mr utterson   eyes “was  my master’s voice” “it seems much changed” replied  lawyer very pale but giving look  look “changed well yes i think so” said  butler “have i been twenty years  this man’s house   deceived about his voice no sir master’s made away with   made away  eight days ago when we heard him cry out upon  name  god  who’s  there instead  him  why  stays there   thing  cries  heaven mr utterson” “this   very strange tale poole this  rather  wild tale my man” said mr utterson biting his finger “suppose    you suppose supposing dr jekyll  have been—well murdered what could induce  murderer  stay that won’t hold water  doesn’t commend itself  reason” “well mr utterson you   hard man  satisfy but i’ll do  yet” said poole “all this last week you must know him or it whatever    lives   cabinet  been crying night  day  some sort  medicine  cannot get   his mind it  sometimes his way—the master’s  is—to write his orders   sheet  paper  throw    stair we’ve had nothing else this week back nothing but papers   closed door   very meals left there   smuggled  when nobody  looking well sir every day ay  twice  thrice   same day there have been orders  complaints  i have been sent flying  all  wholesale chemists  town every time i brought  stuff back there would  another paper telling me  return it because   not pure  another order   different firm this drug  wanted bitter bad sir whatever for” “have you any  these papers” asked mr utterson poole felt  his pocket  handed out  crumpled note which  lawyer bending nearer   candle carefully examined its contents ran thus “dr jekyll presents his compliments  messrs maw he assures them  their last sample  impure  quite useless  his present purpose in  year — dr j purchased  somewhat large quantity  messrs m he now begs them  search  most sedulous care  should any   same quality  left forward   him  once expense  no consideration the importance  this  dr j can hardly  exaggerated” so far  letter had run composedly enough but here   sudden splutter   pen  writer’s emotion had broken loose “for god’s sake”  added “find me some   old” “this   strange note” said mr utterson  then sharply “how do you come  have  open” “the man  maw’s  main angry sir   threw  back  me like so much dirt” returned poole “this  unquestionably  doctor’s hand do you know” resumed  lawyer “i thought  looked like it” said  servant rather sulkily  then  another voice “but what matters hand  write”  said “i’ve seen him” “seen him” repeated mr utterson “well” “that’s it” said poole “it  this way i came suddenly into  theatre   garden it seems  had slipped out  look  this drug or whatever  is   cabinet door  open  there     far end   room digging among  crates he looked up when i came in gave  kind  cry  whipped upstairs into  cabinet it  but  one minute  i saw him but  hair stood upon my head like quills sir if   my master why had   mask upon his face if   my master why did  cry out like  rat  run  me i have served him long enough and then” the man paused  passed his hand over his face “these  all very strange circumstances” said mr utterson “but i think i begin  see daylight your master poole  plainly seized  one  those maladies  both torture  deform  sufferer hence  aught i know  alteration  his voice hence  mask   avoidance  his friends hence his eagerness  find this drug  means  which  poor soul retains some hope  ultimate recovery—god grant    not deceived there  my explanation   sad enough poole ay  appalling  consider but   plain  natural hangs well together  delivers us  all exorbitant alarms” “sir” said  butler turning   sort  mottled pallor “that thing  not my master  there’s  truth my master”—here  looked round him  began  whisper—“is  tall fine build   man  this  more   dwarf” utterson attempted  protest “o sir” cried poole “do you think i do not know my master after twenty years do you think i do not know where his head comes    cabinet door where i saw him every morning  my life no sir  thing   mask  never dr jekyll—god knows what  was but   never dr jekyll     belief  my heart  there  murder done” “poole” replied  lawyer “if you say that   become my duty  make certain much  i desire  spare your master’s feelings much  i am puzzled  this note which seems  prove him   still alive i shall consider  my duty  break   door” “ah mr utterson that’s talking” cried  butler “and now comes  second question” resumed utterson “who  going  do it” “why you  me sir”   undaunted reply “that’s very well said” returned  lawyer “and whatever comes  it i shall make  my business  see you  no loser” “there   axe   theatre” continued poole “and you might take  kitchen poker  yourself” the lawyer took  rude but weighty instrument into his hand  balanced it “do you know poole”  said looking up “that you  i  about  place

figure  you saw did you recognise it” “well sir  went so quick   creature  so doubled up  i could hardly swear  that”   answer “but if you mean   mr hyde—why yes i think  was you see   much   same bigness   had  same quick light way  it  then who else could have got    laboratory door you have not forgot sir    time   murder  had still  key  him but that’s not all i don’t know mr utterson if you ever met this mr hyde” “yes” said  lawyer “i once spoke  him” “then you must know  well   rest  us  there  something queer about  gentleman—something  gave  man  turn—i don’t know rightly how  say it sir beyond this  you felt  your marrow kind  cold  thin” “i own i felt something  what you describe” said mr utterson “quite so sir” returned poole “well when  masked thing like  monkey jumped  among  chemicals  whipped into  cabinet  went down my spine like ice o i know it’s not evidence mr utterson i’m booklearned enough  that but  man  his feelings  i give you my bibleword   mr hyde” “ay ay” said  lawyer “my fears incline   same point evil i fear founded—evil  sure  come—of  connection ay truly i believe you i believe poor harry  killed  i believe his murderer for what purpose god alone can tell  still lurking  his victim’s room well let our name  vengeance call bradshaw” the footman came   summons very white  nervous “pull yourself together bradshaw” said  lawyer “this suspense i know  telling upon all  you but   now our intention  make  end  it poole here  i  going  force our way into  cabinet if all  well my shoulders  broad enough  bear  blame meanwhile lest anything should really  amiss or any malefactor seek  escape   back you   boy must go round  corner   pair  good sticks  take your post   laboratory door we give you ten minutes  get  your stations” as bradshaw left  lawyer looked  his watch “and now poole let us get  ours”  said  taking  poker under his arm led  way into  yard the scud had banked over  moon    now quite dark the wind which only broke  puffs  draughts into  deep well  building tossed  light   candle   fro about their steps until they came into  shelter   theatre where they sat down silently  wait london hummed solemnly all around but nearer  hand  stillness  only broken   sounds   footfall moving   fro along  cabinet floor “so   walk all day sir” whispered poole “ay   better part   night only when  new sample comes   chemist there’s  bit   break ah it’s  ill conscience that’s such  enemy  rest ah sir there’s blood foully shed  every step  it but hark again  little closer—put your heart  your ears mr utterson  tell me    doctor’s foot” the steps fell lightly  oddly   certain swing  all they went so slowly   different indeed   heavy creaking tread  henry jekyll utterson sighed “is there never anything else”  asked poole nodded “once”  said “once i heard  weeping” “weeping how that” said  lawyer conscious   sudden chill  horror “weeping like  woman or  lost soul” said  butler “i came away   upon my heart  i could have wept too” but now  ten minutes drew   end poole disinterred  axe  under  stack  packing straw  candle  set upon  nearest table  light them   attack  they drew near  bated breath  where  patient foot  still going up  down up  down   quiet   night “jekyll” cried utterson   loud voice “i demand  see you” he paused  moment but there came no reply “i give you fair warning our suspicions  aroused  i must  shall see you”  resumed “if not  fair means then  foul—if not  your consent then  brute force” “utterson” said  voice “for god’s sake have mercy” “ah that’s not jekyll’s voice—it’s hyde’s” cried utterson “down   door poole” poole swung  axe over his shoulder  blow shook  building   red baize door leaped against  lock  hinges a dismal screech   mere animal terror rang   cabinet up went  axe again  again  panels crashed   frame bounded four times  blow fell but  wood  tough   fittings   excellent workmanship    not until  fifth   lock burst   wreck   door fell inwards

 most commonplace  night  london right   middle there lay  body   man sorely contorted  still twitching they drew near  tiptoe turned    back  beheld  face  edward hyde he  dressed  clothes far too

lawyer “use” echoed poole “do you not see sir   broken much  if  man had stamped  it” “ay” continued utterson “and  fractures too  rusty” the two men looked  each other   scare “this  beyond me poole” said  lawyer “let us go back   cabinet” they mounted  stair  silence  still   occasional awestruck glance   dead body proceeded more thoroughly  examine  contents   cabinet at one table there  traces  chemical work various measured heaps  some white salt being laid  glass saucers  though   experiment  which  unhappy man had been prevented “that   same drug  i  always bringing him” said poole  even   spoke  kettle   startling noise boiled over this brought them   fireside where  easychair  drawn cosily up   tea things stood ready   sitter’s elbow  very sugar   cup there  several books   shelf one

echoed  lawyer   same tones “for what did jekyll”—he caught himself up   word   start  then conquering  weakness—“what could jekyll want  it”  said “you may say that” said poole next they turned   business table on  desk among  neat array  papers  large envelope  uppermost  bore   doctor’s hand  name  mr utterson the lawyer unsealed it  several enclosures fell   floor the first   will drawn   same eccentric terms   one which  had returned six months before  serve   testament  case  death    deed  gift  case  disappearance but  place   name  edward hyde  lawyer  indescribable amazement read

cannot have been disposed   so short  space  must  still alive  must have fled and then why fled  how    case can we venture  declare this suicide o we must  careful i foresee  we may yet involve your master  some dire catastrophe” “why don’t you read it sir” asked poole “because i fear” replied  lawyer solemnly “god grant i have no cause  it” and    brought  paper  his eyes  read  follows “my dear utterson—when this shall fall into your hands i shall have disappeared under what circumstances i have not  penetration  foresee but my instinct  all  circumstances  my nameless situation tell me

behind them  utterson once more leaving  servants gathered about  fire   hall trudged back  his office  read  two narratives  which this mystery  now   explained dr lanyon’s narrative on  ninth  january now four days ago i received   evening delivery  registered envelope addressed   hand  my colleague  old school companion henry jekyll i   good deal surprised  this  we   no means   habit

the butler  awaiting my arrival  had received   same post  mine  registered letter  instruction  had sent  once   locksmith   carpenter the tradesmen came while we  yet speaking  we moved   body  old dr denman’s surgical theatre  which as you  doubtless aware jekyll’s private cabinet  most conveniently entered the door  very strong  lock excellent  carpenter avowed  would have great trouble  have  do much damage if force    used   locksmith  near despair but this last   handy fellow  after two hour’s work  door stood open the press marked e  unlocked  i took out  drawer had  filled up  straw  tied   sheet  returned    cavendish square here i proceeded  examine  contents the powders  neatly enough made up but not   nicety   dispensing chemist so    plain they   jekyll’s private manufacture  when i opened one   wrappers i found what seemed  me  simple crystalline salt   white colour the phial  which i next turned my attention might have been about half full   bloodred liquor which  highly pungent   sense  smell  seemed  me  contain phosphorus  some volatile ether at  other ingredients i could make no guess the book   ordinary version book  contained little but  series  dates these covered  period  many years but i observed   entries ceased nearly  year ago  quite abruptly here  there  brief remark  appended   date usually no more than  single word “double” occurring perhaps six times   total  several hundred entries  once very early   list  followed  several marks  exclamation “total failure” all this though  whetted my curiosity told me little   definite here   phial  some salt   record   series  experiments  had led like too many  jekyll’s investigations  no end  practical usefulness how could  presence  these articles  my house affect either  honour  sanity or  life  my flighty colleague if his messenger could go  one place why could  not go  another and even granting some impediment why  this gentleman   received  me  secret the more i reflected  more convinced i grew  i  dealing   case  cerebral disease  though i dismissed my servants  bed i loaded  old revolver  i might  found  some posture  selfdefence twelve o’clock had scarce rung out over london ere  knocker sounded very gently   door i went myself   summons  found  small man crouching against  pillars   portico “are you come  dr jekyll” i asked he told me “yes”   constrained gesture  when i had bidden him enter  did not obey me without  searching backward glance into  darkness   square there   policeman not far off advancing  his bull’s eye open    sight i thought my visitor started  made greater haste these particulars struck me i confess disagreeably   i followed him into  bright light   consulting room i kept my hand ready  my weapon here  last i had  chance  clearly seeing him i had never set eyes  him before so much  certain he  small  i have said i  struck besides   shocking expression  his face  his remarkable combination  great muscular activity  great apparent debility  constitution and—last but not least—with  odd subjective disturbance caused  his neighbourhood this bore some resemblance  incipient rigour   accompanied   marked sinking   pulse at  time i set  down  some idiosyncratic personal distaste  merely wondered   acuteness   symptoms but i have since had reason  believe  cause  lie much deeper   nature  man   turn  some nobler hinge than  principle  hatred this person who had thus   first moment  his entrance struck  me what i can only describe   disgustful curiosity  dressed   fashion  would have made  ordinary person laughable his clothes

wide upon his shoulders strange  relate this ludicrous accoutrement  far  moving me  laughter rather  there  something abnormal  misbegotten   very essence   creature  now faced me—something seizing surprising  revolting—this fresh disparity seemed but  fit     reinforce it so   my interest   man’s nature  character there  added  curiosity   his origin his life his fortune  status   world these observations though they have taken so great  space   set down in  yet  work   few seconds my visitor was indeed  fire  sombre excitement “have you got it”  cried “have you got it” and so lively  his impatience   even laid his hand upon my arm  sought  shake me i put him back conscious  his touch   certain icy pang along my blood “come sir” said i “you forget  i have not yet  pleasure  your acquaintance be seated if you please” and i showed him  example  sat down myself  my customary seat    fair  imitation  my ordinary manner   patient   lateness   hour  nature  my preoccupations   horror i had  my visitor would suffer me  muster “i beg your pardon dr lanyon”  replied civilly enough “what you say  very well founded  my impatience  shown  heels  my politeness i come here   instance  your colleague dr henry jekyll   piece  business  some moment  i understood” he paused  put his hand  his throat  i could see  spite  his collected manner    wrestling against  approaches   hysteria—“i understood  drawer” but here i took pity  my visitor’s suspense  some perhaps  my own growing curiosity “there  is sir” said i pointing   drawer where  lay   floor behind  table  still covered   sheet he sprang  it  then paused  laid his hand upon his heart i could hear his teeth grate   convulsive action  his jaws  his face  so ghastly  see  i grew alarmed both  his life  reason “compose yourself” said i he turned  dreadful smile  me   if   decision  despair plucked away  sheet at sight   contents  uttered one loud sob  such immense relief  i sat petrified and  next moment   voice   already fairly well under control “have you  graduated glass”  asked i rose  my place  something   effort  gave him what  asked he thanked me   smiling nod measured out  few minims   red tincture  added one   powders the mixture which   first   reddish hue began  proportion   crystals melted  brighten  colour  effervesce audibly   throw off small fumes  vapour suddenly    same moment  ebullition ceased   compound changed   dark purple which faded again more slowly   watery green my visitor who had watched these metamorphoses   keen eye smiled set down  glass upon  table  then turned  looked upon me   air  scrutiny “and now” said he “to settle what remains will you  wise  you  guided  you suffer me  take this glass  my hand   go forth  your house without further parley or   greed  curiosity too much command  you think before you answer   shall  done  you decide as you decide you shall  left  you  before  neither richer nor wiser unless  sense  service rendered   man

belief but i have gone too far   way  inexplicable services  pause before i see  end” “it  well” replied my visitor “lanyon you remember your vows what follows  under  seal  our profession and now you who have so long been bound   most narrow  material views you who have denied  virtue  transcendental medicine you who have derided your superiors—behold” he put  glass  his lips  drank  one gulp a cry followed  reeled staggered clutched   table  held on staring  injected eyes gasping  open mouth   i looked there came i thought  change—he seemed  swell—his face became suddenly black   features seemed  melt  alter—and  next moment i had sprung  my feet  leaped back against  wall my arms raised  shield me   prodigy my mind submerged  terror “o god” i screamed  “o god” again  again  there before my eyes—pale  shaken  half fainting  groping before him  his hands like  man restored  death—there stood henry jekyll what  told me   next hour i cannot bring my mind  set  paper i saw what i saw i heard what i heard  my soul sickened  it  yet now when  sight  faded  my eyes i ask myself if i believe it  i cannot answer my life  shaken   roots sleep  left me  deadliest terror sits  me  all hours   day  night  i feel  my days  numbered   i must die  yet i shall die incredulous as   moral turpitude  man unveiled  me even  tears  penitence i cannot even  memory dwell   without  start

me but  second or two  mix  swallow  draught  i had always standing ready  whatever  had done edward hyde would pass away like  stain  breath upon  mirror  there  his stead quietly  home trimming  midnight lamp  his study  man who could afford  laugh  suspicion would  henry jekyll the pleasures which i made haste  seek  my disguise were  i have said undignified i would scarce use  harder term but   hands  edward hyde they soon began  turn toward  monstrous when i would come back  these excursions i  often plunged into  kind  wonder  my vicarious depravity this familiar  i called out  my own soul  sent forth alone  do his good pleasure   being inherently malign  villainous his every act  thought centered  self drinking pleasure  bestial avidity  any degree  torture  another relentless like  man  stone henry jekyll stood  times aghast before  acts  edward hyde but  situation  apart  ordinary laws  insidiously relaxed  grasp  conscience it  hyde after all  hyde alone   guilty jekyll  no worse  woke again  his good qualities seemingly unimpaired  would even make haste where   possible  undo  evil done  hyde and thus his conscience slumbered into  details   infamy  which i thus connived for even now i can scarce grant  i committed it i have no design  entering i mean but  point out  warnings   successive steps  which my chastisement approached i met  one accident which   brought  no consequence i shall no more than mention an act  cruelty   child aroused against me  anger   passerby whom i recognised  other day   person  your kinsman  doctor   child’s family joined

eliminated   future  opening  account  another bank   name  edward hyde himself  when  sloping my own hand backward i had supplied my double   signature i thought i sat beyond  reach  fate some two months before  murder  sir danvers i had been out  one  my adventures had returned   late hour  woke  next day  bed  somewhat odd sensations it   vain i looked about me  vain i saw  decent furniture  tall proportions  my room   square  vain  i recognised  pattern   bed curtains   design   mahogany frame something still kept insisting  i  not where i was  i had not wakened where i seemed  be but   little room  soho where i  accustomed  sleep   body  edward hyde i smiled  myself   my psychological way began lazily  inquire into  elements  this illusion occasionally even  i did so dropping back into  comfortable morning doze i  still so engaged when  one  my more wakeful moments my eyes fell upon my hand now  hand  henry jekyll as you have often remarked  professional  shape  size   large firm white  comely but  hand which i now saw clearly enough   yellow light   midlondon morning lying half shut   bedclothes  lean corded knuckly   dusky pallor  thickly shaded   swart growth  hair it   hand  edward hyde i must have stared upon   near half  minute sunk  i    mere stupidity  wonder before terror woke up  my breast  sudden  startling   crash  cymbals  bounding  my bed i rushed   mirror at  sight  met my eyes my blood  changed into something exquisitely thin  icy yes i had gone  bed henry jekyll i had awakened edward hyde how  this   explained i asked myself  then  another bound  terror—how     remedied it  well    morning  servants  up all my drugs    cabinet—a long journey down two pairs  stairs through  back passage across  open court  through  anatomical theatre  where i  then standing horrorstruck it might indeed  possible  cover my face but  what use  that when i  unable  conceal  alteration  my stature and then   overpowering sweetness  relief  came back upon my mind   servants  already used   coming  going  my second self i had soon dressed  well  i  able  clothes  my own size had soon passed through  house where bradshaw stared  drew back  seeing mr hyde  such  hour   such  strange array  ten minutes later dr jekyll had returned  his own shape   sitting down   darkened brow  make  feint  breakfasting small indeed  my appetite this inexplicable incident this reversal  my previous experience seemed like  babylonian finger   wall   spelling out  letters  my judgment  i began  reflect more seriously than ever before   issues  possibilities  my double existence that part  me which i had  power  projecting had lately been much exercised  nourished  had seemed  me  late  though  body  edward hyde had grown  stature  though when i wore  form i  conscious   more generous tide  blood  i began  spy  danger that if this  much prolonged  balance  my nature might  permanently overthrown  power  voluntary change  forfeited   character  edward hyde become irrevocably mine the power   drug had not been always equally displayed once very early  my career  had totally failed me since then i had been obliged  more than one occasion  double  once  infinite risk  death  treble  amount  these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto  sole shadow  my contentment now however    light   morning’s accident i  led  remark  whereas   beginning  difficulty had been  throw off  body  jekyll  had  late gradually but decidedly transferred itself   other side all things therefore seemed  point  this  i  slowly losing hold  my original  better self  becoming slowly incorporated  my second  worse between these two i now felt i had  choose my two natures had memory  common but all other faculties  most unequally shared between them jekyll who  composite now   most sensitive apprehensions now   greedy gusto projected  shared   pleasures  adventures  hyde but hyde  indifferent  jekyll or but remembered him   mountain bandit remembers  cavern  which  conceals himself  pursuit jekyll had more than  father’s interest hyde had more than  son’s indifference to cast  my lot  jekyll   die  those appetites which i had long secretly indulged  had  late begun  pamper to cast    hyde   die   thousand interests  aspirations   become   blow  forever despised  friendless the bargain might appear unequal but there  still another consideration   scales  while jekyll would suffer smartingly   fires  abstinence hyde would  not even conscious  all   had lost strange  my circumstances were  terms  this debate   old  commonplace  man much  same inducements  alarms cast  die  any tempted  trembling sinner   fell out  me   falls  so vast  majority  my fellows  i chose  better part   found wanting   strength  keep  it yes i preferred  elderly  discontented doctor surrounded  friends  cherishing honest hopes  bade  resolute farewell   liberty  comparative youth  light step leaping impulses  secret pleasures  i had enjoyed   disguise  hyde i made this choice perhaps  some unconscious reservation  i neither gave up  house  soho nor destroyed  clothes  edward hyde which still lay ready  my cabinet for two months however i  true  my determination  two months i led  life  such severity  i had never before attained to  enjoyed  compensations   approving conscience but time began  last  obliterate  freshness  my alarm  praises  conscience began  grow into  thing  course i began   tortured  throes  longings   hyde struggling after freedom   last   hour  moral weakness i once again compounded  swallowed  transforming draught i do not suppose that when  drunkard reasons  himself upon his vice   once out  five hundred times affected   dangers   runs through his brutish physical insensibility neither had i long  i had considered my position made enough allowance   complete moral insensibility  insensate readiness  evil which   leading characters  edward hyde yet    these  i  punished my devil had been long caged  came out roaring i  conscious even when i took  draught   more unbridled  more furious propensity  ill it must have been this i suppose  stirred  my soul  tempest  impatience  which i listened   civilities  my unhappy victim i declare  least before god no man morally sane could have been guilty   crime upon so pitiful  provocation   i struck  no more reasonable spirit than   which  sick child may break  plaything but i had voluntarily stripped myself  all those balancing instincts  which even  worst  us continues  walk  some degree  steadiness among temptations   my case   tempted however slightly   fall instantly  spirit  hell awoke  me  raged with  transport  glee i mauled  unresisting body tasting delight  every blow    not till weariness had begun  succeed  i  suddenly   top fit  my delirium struck through  heart   cold thrill  terror a mist dispersed i saw my life   forfeit  fled   scene  these excesses  once glorying  trembling my lust  evil gratified  stimulated my love  life screwed   topmost peg i ran   house  soho  to make assurance doubly sure destroyed my papers thence i set out through  lamplit streets   same divided ecstasy  mind gloating  my crime lightheadedly devising others   future  yet still hastening  still hearkening  my wake   steps   avenger hyde had  song upon his lips   compounded  draught    drank it pledged  dead man the pangs  transformation had not done tearing him before henry jekyll  streaming tears  gratitude  remorse had fallen upon his knees  lifted his clasped hands  god the veil  selfindulgence  rent  head  foot i saw my life   whole i followed  up   days  childhood when i had walked  my father’s hand  through  selfdenying toils  my professional life  arrive again  again   same sense  unreality   damned horrors   evening i could have screamed aloud i sought  tears  prayers  smother down  crowd  hideous images  sounds  which my memory swarmed against me  still between  petitions  ugly face  my iniquity stared into my soul as  acuteness  this remorse began  die away   succeeded   sense  joy the problem  my conduct  solved hyde  thenceforth impossible whether i would or not i  now confined   better part  my existence  o how i rejoiced  think  it  what willing humility i embraced anew  restrictions  natural life  what sincere renunciation i locked  door  which i had so often gone  come  ground  key under my heel the next day came  news   murder had been overlooked   guilt  hyde  patent   world    victim   man high  public estimation it  not only  crime  had been  tragic folly i think i  glad  know it i think i  glad  have my better impulses thus buttressed  guarded   terrors   scaffold jekyll  now my city  refuge let but hyde peep out  instant   hands  all men would  raised  take  slay him i resolved  my future conduct  redeem  past  i can say  honesty  my resolve  fruitful  some good you know yourself how earnestly   last months   last year i laboured  relieve suffering you know  much  done  others    days passed quietly almost happily  myself nor can i truly say  i wearied  this beneficent  innocent life i think instead  i daily enjoyed  more completely but i  still cursed  my duality  purpose    first edge  my penitence wore off  lower side  me so long indulged so recently chained down began  growl  licence not  i dreamed  resuscitating hyde  bare idea   would startle me  frenzy no    my own person  i  once more tempted  trifle  my conscience      ordinary secret sinner  i  last fell before  assaults  temptation there comes  end  all things  most capacious measure  filled  last  this brief condescension  my evil finally destroyed  balance  my soul and yet i  not alarmed  fall seemed natural like  return   old days before i had made my discovery it   fine clear january day wet under foot where  frost had melted but cloudless overhead   regent’s park  full  winter chirrupings  sweet  spring odours i sat   sun   bench  animal within me licking  chops  memory  spiritual side  little drowsed promising subsequent penitence but not yet moved  begin after all i reflected i  like my neighbours  then i smiled comparing myself  other men comparing my active goodwill   lazy cruelty  their neglect and   very moment   vainglorious thought  qualm came over me  horrid nausea   most deadly shuddering these passed away  left me faint  then    turn faintness subsided i began   aware   change   temper  my thoughts  greater boldness  contempt  danger  solution   bonds  obligation i looked down my clothes hung formlessly  my shrunken limbs  hand  lay  my knee  corded  hairy i  once more edward hyde a moment before i had been safe  all men’s respect wealthy beloved—the cloth laying  me   diningroom  home  now i   common quarry  mankind hunted houseless  known murderer thrall   gallows my reason wavered but  did not fail me utterly i have more than once observed   my second character my faculties seemed sharpened   point  my spirits more tensely elastic thus  came about that where jekyll perhaps might have succumbed hyde rose   importance   moment my drugs   one   presses  my cabinet how  i  reach them that   problem  crushing my temples  my hands i set myself  solve the laboratory door i had closed if i sought  enter   house my own servants would consign me   gallows i saw i must employ another hand  thought  lanyon how     reached how persuaded supposing  i escaped capture   streets how  i  make my way into his presence  how should i  unknown  displeasing visitor prevail   famous physician  rifle  study  his colleague dr jekyll then i remembered   my original character one part remained  me i could write my own hand  once i had conceived  kindling spark  way  i must follow became lighted up  end  end thereupon i arranged my clothes  best i could  summoning  passing hansom drove   hotel  portland street  name  which i chanced  remember at my appearance which  indeed comical enough however tragic  fate these garments covered  driver could not conceal his mirth i gnashed my teeth upon him   gust  devilish fury   smile withered  his face—happily  him—yet more happily  myself   another instant i had certainly dragged him  his perch at  inn  i entered i looked about me  so black  countenance  made  attendants tremble not  look did they exchange  my presence but obsequiously took my orders led me   private room  brought me wherewithal  write hyde  danger  his life   creature new  me shaken  inordinate anger strung   pitch  murder lusting  inflict pain yet  creature  astute mastered his fury   great effort   will composed his two important letters one  lanyon  one  poole    might receive actual evidence  their being posted sent them out  directions  they should  registered thenceforward  sat all day over  fire   private room gnawing his nails there  dined sitting alone  his fears  waiter visibly quailing before his eye  thence when  night  fully come  set forth   corner   closed cab   driven   fro about  streets   city he i say—i cannot say i that child  hell had nothing human nothing lived  him but fear  hatred and when  last thinking  driver had begun  grow suspicious  discharged  cab  ventured  foot attired  his misfitting clothes  object marked out  observation into  midst   nocturnal passengers these two base passions raged within him like  tempest he walked fast hunted  his fears chattering  himself skulking through  less frequented thoroughfares counting  minutes  still divided him  midnight once  woman spoke  him offering i think  box  lights he smote her   face  she fled when i came  myself  lanyon’s  horror  my old friend perhaps affected me somewhat i do not know    least but  drop   sea   abhorrence  which i looked back upon these hours a change had come over me it  no longer  fear   gallows    horror  being hyde  racked me i received lanyon’s condemnation partly   dream   partly   dream  i came home  my own house  got into bed i slept after  prostration   day   stringent  profound slumber which not even  nightmares  wrung me could avail  break i awoke   morning shaken weakened but refreshed i still hated  feared  thought   brute  slept within me  i had not  course forgotten  appalling dangers   day before but i  once more  home  my own house  close  my drugs  gratitude  my escape shone so strong  my soul   almost rivalled  brightness  hope i

readministered in short   day forth  seemed only   great effort   gymnastics  only under  immediate stimulation   drug  i  able  wear  countenance  jekyll at all hours   day  night i would  taken   premonitory shudder above all if i slept or even dozed   moment  my chair   always  hyde  i awakened under  strain  this continually impending doom    sleeplessness  which i now condemned myself ay even beyond what i had thought possible  man i became  my own person  creature eaten up  emptied  fever languidly weak both  body  mind  solely occupied  one thought  horror  my other self but when i slept or when  virtue   medicine wore off i would leap almost without transition for  pangs  transformation grew daily less marked into  possession   fancy brimming  images  terror  soul boiling  causeless hatreds   body  seemed not strong enough  contain  raging energies  life the powers  hyde seemed  have grown   sickliness  jekyll and certainly  hate  now divided them  equal  each side with
