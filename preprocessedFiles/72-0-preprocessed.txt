royal gardens  thuvan dihn jeddak  ptarth   darkhaired redskinned warrior bent low toward her whispering heated words close  her ear “ah thuvia  ptarth”  cried “you  cold even before  fiery blasts  my consuming love no harder than your heart nor colder   hard cold ersite  this thrice happy bench which supports your divine  fadeless form tell me o thuvia  ptarth  i may still hope—that though you do not love me now yet some day some day my princess i—” the girl sprang  her feet   exclamation  surprise  displeasure her queenly head  poised haughtily upon her smooth red shoulders her dark eyes looked angrily into those   man “you forget yourself   customs  barsoom astok” she said “i have given you no right thus  address  daughter  thuvan dihn nor have you won such  right” the man reached suddenly forth  grasped her   arm “you shall  my princess”  cried “by  breast  issus thou shalt nor shall any other come between astok prince  dusar  his heart’s desire tell me  there  another  i shall cut out his foul heart  fling    wild calots   dead seabottoms” at touch   man’s hand upon her flesh  girl went pallid beneath her coppery skin   persons   royal women   courts  mars  held but little less than sacred the act  astok prince  dusar  profanation there  no terror   eyes  thuvia  ptarth—only horror   thing  man had done    possible consequences “release me” her voice  level—frigid the man muttered incoherently  drew her roughly toward him “release me” she repeated sharply “or i call  guard   prince  dusar knows what   mean” quickly  threw his right arm about her shoulders  strove  draw her face  his lips with  little cry she struck him full   mouth   massive bracelets  circled her free arm “calot” she exclaimed  then “the guard the guard hasten  protection   princess  ptarth” in answer  her call  dozen guardsmen came racing across  scarlet sward their gleaming longswords naked   sun  metal  their accoutrements clanking against   their leathern harness   their throats hoarse shouts  rage   sight which met their eyes but before they had passed half across  royal garden  where astok  dusar still held  struggling girl  his grasp another figure sprang

  copper colour  marks  red men  mars   other races   dying planet—he  like them  yet there   subtle difference greater even than  which lay  his lighter skin  his grey eyes there   difference too  his movements he came   great leaps  carried him so swiftly over  ground   speed   guardsmen   nothing  comparison astok still clutched thuvia’s wrist   young warrior confronted him the newcomer wasted no time   spoke but  single word “calot”  snapped  then his clenched fist landed beneath  other’s chin lifting him high into  air  depositing him   crumpled heap within  centre   pimalia bush beside  ersite bench her champion turned toward  girl “kaor thuvia  ptarth”  cried “it seems  fate timed my visit well” “kaor carthoris  helium”  princess returned  young man’s greeting “and what less could one expect   son  such  sire” he bowed his acknowledgment   compliment  his father john carter warlord  mars and then  guardsmen panting  their charge came up just   prince  dusar bleeding   mouth   drawn sword crawled   entanglement   pimalia astok would have leaped  mortal combat   son  dejah thoris but  guardsmen pressed about him preventing though   clearly evident  naught would have better pleased carthoris  helium “but say  word thuvia  ptarth”  begged “and naught  give me greater pleasure than meting  this fellow  punishment   earned” “it cannot be carthoris” she replied “even though   forfeited all claim upon my consideration yet    guest   jeddak my father   him alone may  account   unpardonable act   committed” “as you say thuvia” replied  heliumite “but afterward  shall

the young man hesitated he looked toward his princess she too guessed all  hung upon  action   coming moment for many years dusar  ptarth had been  peace  each other their great merchant ships plied back  forth between  larger cities   two nations even now far above  goldshot scarlet dome   jeddak’s palace she could see  huge bulk   giant freighter taking  majestic way through  thin barsoomian

toward  massive marble pile  housed  ruler  ptarth  his glittering court on either side marched  file  guardsmen thus thuvia  ptarth found  way out   dilemma escaping  necessity  placing her father’s royal guest under forcible restraint    same time separating  two princes who otherwise would have been  each other’s throat  moment she   guard had departed beside  pimalia stood astok his dark eyes narrowed  mere slits  hate beneath his lowering brows   watched  retreating forms   woman who had aroused  fiercest passions  his nature   man whom  now believed    one who stood between his love   consummation as they disappeared within  structure astok shrugged his shoulders    murmured oath crossed  gardens toward another wing   building where   his retinue  housed that night  took formal leave  thuvan dihn  though no mention  made   happening within  garden   plain  see through  cold mask   jeddak’s courtesy  only  customs  royal hospitality restrained him  voicing  contempt  felt   prince  dusar carthoris  not present   leavetaking nor  thuvia the ceremony   stiff  formal  court etiquette could make it  when  last   dusarians clambered over  rail   battleship  had brought them

craft growing smaller   distance beside her   brilliant light   nearer moon sat carthoris his eyes  not upon  dim bulk   battleship but   profile   girl’s upturned face “thuvia”  whispered the girl turned her eyes toward his his hand stole out  find hers but she drew her own gently away “thuvia  ptarth i love you” cried  young warrior “tell me   does not offend” she shook her head sadly “the love  carthoris  helium” she said simply “could  naught but  honour  any woman but you must not speak my friend  bestowing upon me  which i may not reciprocate” the young man got slowly  his feet his eyes  wide  astonishment it never had occurred   prince  helium  thuvia  ptarth might love another “but  kadabra”  exclaimed “and later here  your father’s court what did you do thuvia  ptarth  might have warned me  you could not return my love” “and what did i do carthoris  helium” she returned “that might lead you  believe  i did return it” he paused  thought  then shook his head “nothing thuvia   true yet i could have sworn you loved me indeed you well knew how near  worship  been my love  you” “and how might i know it carthoris” she asked innocently “did you ever tell me  much ever before have words  love  me fallen  your lips” “but you must have known it”  exclaimed “i am like my father—witless  matters   heart    poor way  women yet  jewels  strew these royal garden paths—the trees  flowers  sward—all must have read  love   filled my heart since first my eyes  made new  imaging your perfect face  form so how could you alone have been blind  it” “do  maids  helium pay court  their men” asked thuvia “you  playing  me” exclaimed carthoris “say  you  but playing   after all you love me thuvia” “i cannot tell you that carthoris  i am promised  another” her tone  level but  there not within   hint   infinite depth  sadness who may say “promised  another” carthoris scarcely breathed  words his face went almost white  then his head came up  befitted him  whose veins flowed  blood   overlord   world “carthoris  helium wishes you every happiness   man  your choice”  said “with—”  then  hesitated waiting  her  fill   name “kulan tith jeddak  kaol” she replied “my father’s friend  ptarth’s most puissant ally” the young man looked  her intently   moment before  spoke again “you love him thuvia  ptarth”  asked “i am promised  him” she replied simply he did not press her “he   barsoom’s noblest blood  mightiest fighters” mused carthoris “my father’s friend  mine—would   might have been another”  muttered almost savagely what  girl thought  hidden   mask  her expression which  tinged only   little shadow  sadness  might have been  carthoris herself or  them both carthoris  helium did not ask though  noted it  his loyalty  kulan tith   loyalty   blood  john carter  virginia   friend greater than which could  no loyalty he raised  jewelencrusted bit   girl’s magnificent trappings  his lips “to  honour  happiness  kulan tith   priceless jewel   been

know it  there  no dishonour   either  you or  kulan tith or  myself my love  such   may embrace  well kulan tith—if you love him” there  almost  question   statement “i am promised  him” she replied carthoris backed slowly away he laid one hand upon his heart  other upon  pommel  his longsword “these  yours—always”  said a moment later  had entered  palace   gone   girl’s sight had  returned

fruitless quest until near sunset  came opposite  mighty gate   city’s western wall here seemed    principal force   attacking horde here  great platform had been erected whereon carthoris could see squatting  huge green warrior surrounded  others  his kind this then must   notorious hortan gur jeddak  torquas  fierce old ogre   southwestern hemisphere  only   jeddak  platforms raised  temporary

hortan gur address her he could not hear  creature’s words nor thuvia’s reply but  must have angered  green monster  carthoris saw him leap toward  prisoner striking her  cruel blow across  face  his

when  new factor succeeded  still further directing  attention   latter  him upon  high tower within  beleaguered city  man appeared from his upturned mouth there issued  series  frightful shrieks uncanny shrieks  swept shrill  terrifying across  city’s walls over  heads   besiegers  out across  forest   uttermost confines   valley once twice thrice  fearsome sound smote upon  ears   listening green men  then far far off across  broad woods came sharp  clear   distance  answering shriek it  but  first from every point rose similar savage cries until  world seemed  tremble  their reverberations the green warriors looked nervously this way  that they knew not fear  earth men may know it but   face   unusual their wonted selfassurance deserted them and then  great gate   city wall opposite  platform  hortan gur swung suddenly wide from  issued  strange  sight  carthoris ever had witnessed though   moment  had time  cast but  single fleeting glance   tall bowmen emerging through  portal behind their long oval shields  note their flowing auburn hair   realize   growling things  their side  fierce barsoomian lions then     midst   astonished torquasians with drawn longsword   among them   thuvia  ptarth whose startled eyes   first  fall upon him  seemed  she  looking upon john carter himself so strangely similar   fighting   father     son even   famous fighting smile   virginian   resemblance true and  sword arm ah  subtleness  it   speed all about  turmoil  confusion green warriors  leaping   backs  their restive squealing thoats calots  growling

warriors turned principally upon  bowmen advancing upon them   city  upon  savage banths  paced beside them—cruel beasts  war infinitely more terrible than their own savage calots as carthoris leaped   rostrum  drew thuvia up beside him  then  turned upon  departing jeddak   angry challenge   sword thrust as  heliumite’s point pricked his green hide hortan gur turned upon his adversary   snarl but   same instant two  his chieftains called  him  hasten   charge   fairskinned inhabitants   city  developing into  more serious matter than  torquasians had anticipated instead  remaining  battle   red man hortan gur promised him his attention after  had disposed   presumptuous citizens   walled city and leaping astride his thoat galloped off  meet  rapidly advancing bowmen the other warriors quickly followed their jeddak leaving thuvia  carthoris alone upon  platform between them   city raged  terrific battle the fairskinned warriors armed only  their long bows   kind  shorthandled waraxe  almost helpless beneath  savage mounted green men  close quarters but   distance their sharp arrows did fully  much execution   radium projectiles   green men but if  warriors themselves  outclassed not so their savage companions  fierce banths scarce had  two lines come together when hundreds  these appalling creatures had leaped among  torquasians dragging warriors  their thoats—dragging down  huge thoats themselves  bringing consternation  all before them the numbers   citizenry too   their advantage   seemed  scarce  warrior fell but his place  taken   score more  such  constant stream did they pour   city’s great gate and so  came what   ferocity   banths   numbers   bowmen   last  torquasians fell back until presently  platform upon which stood carthoris  thuvia lay directly   centre   fight that neither  struck   bullet or  arrow seemed  miracle  both but  last  tide had rolled completely past them so  they  alone between  fighters   city except   dying   dead   score or so  growling banths less well trained than their fellows who prowled among  corpses seeking meat to carthoris  strangest part   battle had been  terrific toll taken   bowmen  their relatively puny weapons nowhere   could see  there  single wounded green man but  corpses  their dead lay thick upon  field  battle death seemed  follow instantly  slightest pinprick   bowman’s arrow nor apparently did one ever miss  goal there could  but one explanation  missiles  poisontipped presently  sounds  conflict died   distant forest quiet reigned broken only   growling   devouring banths carthoris turned toward thuvia  ptarth as yet neither had spoken “where  we thuvia”  asked the girl looked  him questioningly his very presence had seemed  proclaim  guilty knowledge  her abduction how else might  have known  destination   flier  brought her “who should know better than  prince  helium” she asked  return “did  not come hither  his own free will” “from aaanthor i came voluntarily upon  trail   green man who had stolen you thuvia”  replied “but   time i left helium until i awoke above aaanthor i thought myself bound  ptarth “it had been intimated  i had guilty knowledge  your abduction”  explained simply “and i  hastening   jeddak your father  convince him   falsity   charge   give my service  your recovery before i left helium some one tampered  my compass so   bore me  aaanthor instead   ptarth that  all you believe me” “but  warriors who stole me   garden” she exclaimed “after we arrived  aaanthor they wore  metal   prince  helium when they took me they  trapped  dusarian harness there seemed but  single explanation whoever dared  outrage wished  put  onus upon another should   detected   act but once safely away  ptarth  felt safe  having his minions return  their own harness” “you believe  i did this thing thuvia”  asked “ah carthoris” she replied sadly “i did not wish  believe it but when everything pointed  you—even then i would not believe it” “i did not do it thuvia”  said “but let me  entirely honest  you as much  i love your father  much  i respect kulan tith  whom you  betrothed  well  i know  frightful consequences  must have followed such  act  mine hurling into war   would three   greatest nations  barsoom—yet notwithstanding all this i should not have hesitated  take you thus thuvia  ptarth had you even hinted   would not have displeased you “but you did nothing   kind  so i am here not  my own service but  yours    service   man  whom you  promised  save you  him if  lies within  power  man  do so”  concluded almost bitterly thuvia  ptarth looked into his face  several moments her breast  rising  falling  though  some resistless emotion she half took  step toward him her lips parted  though  speak—swiftly  impetuously and then she conquered whatever had moved her “the future acts   prince  helium” she said coldly “must constitute  proof  his past honesty  purpose” carthoris  hurt   girl’s tone  much    doubt   his integrity which her words implied he had half hoped  she might hint  his love would  acceptable—certainly there  due him  least  little gratitude  his recent acts  her behalf but  best  received  cold skepticism the prince  helium shrugged his broad shoulders the girl noted it   little smile  touched his lips so   became her turn   hurt of course she had not meant  hurt him he might have known  after what  had said she could not do anything  encourage him but  need not have made his indifference quite so palpable the men  helium  noted  their gallantry—not  boorishness possibly    earth blood  flowed  his veins how could she know   shrug  but carthoris’ way  attempting  physical effort  cast blighting sorrow  his heart or   smile upon his lips   fighting smile  his father  which  son gave outward evidence   determination  had reached  submerge his own great love  his efforts  save thuvia  ptarth  another because  believed  she loved this other he reverted  his original question “where  we”  asked “i do not know” “nor i” replied  girl “those who stole me  ptarth spoke among themselves  aaanthor so  i thought  possible   ancient city  which they took me   famous ruin but where we may  now i have no idea” “when  bowmen return we shall doubtless learn all  there   know” said carthoris “let us hope  they prove friendly what race may they be only   most ancient  our legends    mural paintings   deserted cities   dead seabottoms  depicted such  race  auburnhaired fairskinned people can    we have stumbled upon  surviving city   past which all barsoom believes buried beneath  ages” thuvia  looking toward  forest into which  green men   pursuing bowmen had disappeared from  great distance came  hideous cries  banths   occasional shot “it  strange  they do not return” said  girl “one would expect  see  wounded limping or being carried back   city” replied carthoris   puzzled frown “but how about  wounded nearer  city have they carried them within” both turned their eyes toward  field between them   walled city where  fighting had been most furious there   banths still growling about their hideous feast carthoris looked  thuvia  astonishment then  pointed toward  field “where  they”  whispered “what  become  their dead  wounded” chapter vi the jeddak of lothar the girl looked her incredulity “they lay  piles” she murmured “there  thousands  them but  minute ago” “and now” continued carthoris “there remain but  banths   carcasses   green men” “they must have sent forth  carried  dead bowmen away while we  talking” said  girl “it  impossible” replied carthoris “thousands  dead lay there upon  field but  moment since it would have required many hours  have removed them the thing  uncanny” “i had hoped” said thuvia “that we might find  asylum  these fairskinned people notwithstanding their valour upon  field  battle they did not strike me   ferocious or warlike people i had been about  suggest  we seek entrance   city but now i scarce know if i care  venture among people whose dead vanish into thin air” “let us chance it” replied carthoris “we can  no worse off within their walls than without here we may fall prey   banths or  no less fierce torquasians there  least we shall find beings moulded after our own images “all  causes me  hesitate”  added “is  danger  taking you past so many banths a single sword would scarce prevail  even  couple  them  charge simultaneously” “do not fear   score” replied  girl smiling “the banths  not harm us” as she spoke she descended   platform   carthoris  her side stepped fearlessly out upon  bloody field   direction   walled city  mystery they had advanced but  short distance when  banth looking up   gory feast descried them with  angry roar  beast walked quickly  their direction    sound   voice  score  others followed  example carthoris drew his longsword the girl stole  quick glance  his face she saw  smile upon his lips     wine  sick nerves  even upon warlike barsoom where all men  brave woman reacts quickly  quiet indifference  danger—to daredeviltry   without bombast “you may return your sword” she said “i told you   banths would not harm us look”   she spoke she stepped quickly toward  nearest animal carthoris would have leaped after her  protect her but   gesture she motioned him back he heard her calling   banths   low singsong voice   half purr instantly  great heads went up  all  wicked eyes  riveted upon  figure   girl then stealthily they commenced moving toward her she had stopped now   standing waiting them one closer  her than  others hesitated she spoke  him imperiously   master might speak   refractory hound the great carnivore let  head droop   tail between  legs came slinking   girl’s feet  after  came  others until she  entirely surrounded   savage maneaters turning she led them  where carthoris stood they growled  little  they neared  man but  few sharp words  command put them  their places “how do you do it” exclaimed carthoris “your father once asked me  same question   galleries   golden cliffs within  otz mountains beneath  temples   therns i could not answer him nor can i answer you i do not know whence comes my power over them but ever since  day  sator throg threw me among them   banth pit   holy therns   great creatures fawned upon instead  devouring me i ever have had  same strange power over them they come  my call  do my bidding even   faithful woola does  bidding  your mighty sire” with  word  girl dispersed  fierce pack roaring they returned  their interrupted feast while carthoris  thuvia passed among them toward  walled city as they advanced  man looked  wonder upon  dead bodies  those   green men  had not been devoured or mauled   banths he called  girl’s attention  them no arrows protruded   great carcasses nowhere upon any  them   sign  mortal wound nor even slightest scratch or abrasion before  bowmen’s dead had disappeared  corpses   torquasians had bristled   deadly arrows  their foes where had  slender messengers  death departed what unseen hand had plucked them   bodies   slain despite himself carthoris could scarce repress  shudder  apprehension   glanced toward  silent city before them no longer  sign  life visible upon wall or roof top all  quiet—brooding ominous quiet yet   sure  eyes watched them  somewhere behind  blank wall he glanced  thuvia she  advancing  wide eyes fixed upon  city gate he looked   direction  her gaze but saw nothing his gaze upon her seemed  arouse her    lethargy she glanced up  him  quick brave smile touching her lips  then  though  act  involuntary she came close  his side  placed one  her hands  his he guessed  something within her   beyond her conscious control  appealing  him  protection he threw  arm about her  thus they crossed  field she did not draw away  him it  doubtful  she realized  his arm  there so engrossed  she   mystery   strange city before them they stopped before  gate it   mighty thing from  construction carthoris could but dimly speculate upon  unthinkable antiquity it  circular closing  circular aperture   heliumite knew  his study  ancient barsoomian architecture   rolled  one side like  huge wheel into  aperture   wall even such worldold cities  ancient aaanthor   yet undreamed  when  races lived  built such gates  these as  stood speculating upon  identity  this forgotten city  voice spoke  them  above both looked up there leaning over  edge   high wall   man his hair  auburn his skin fair—fairer even than   john carter  virginian his forehead  high his eyes large  intelligent the language   used  intelligible   two below yet there   marked difference between   their barsoomian tongue “who  you”  asked “and what do you here before  gate  lothar” “we  friends” replied carthoris “this   princess thuvia  ptarth who  captured   torquasian horde i am carthoris  helium prince   house  tardos mors jeddak  helium  son  john carter warlord  mars   his wife dejah thoris” “‘ptarth’” repeated  man “‘helium’” he shook his head “i never have heard  these places nor did i know  there dwelt upon barsoom  race  thy strange colour where may these cities lie  which you speak from our loftiest tower we have never seen another city than lothar” carthoris pointed toward  northeast “in  direction lie helium  ptarth”  said “helium  over eight thousand haads  lothar while ptarth lies nine thousand five hundred haads northeast  helium” still  man shook his head “i know  nothing beyond  lotharian hills”  said “naught may live there beside  hideous green hordes  torquas they have conquered all barsoom except this single valley   city  lothar here we have defied them  countless ages though periodically they renew their attempts  destroy us from whence you come i cannot guess unless you  descended   slaves  torquasians captured  early times when they reduced  outer world  their vassalage but we had heard  they destroyed all other races but their own” carthoris tried  explain   torquasians ruled but  relatively tiny part   surface  barsoom  even this only because their domain held nothing  attract  red race but  lotharian could not seem  conceive  anything beyond  valley  lothar other than  trackless waste peopled   ferocious green hordes  torquas after considerable parleying  consented  admit them   city   moment later  wheellike gate rolled back within  niche  thuvia  carthoris entered  city  lothar all about them  evidences  fabulous wealth the facades   buildings fronting upon  avenue within  wall  richly carven  about  windows  doors  ofttimes set footwide borders  precious stones intricate mosaics or tablets  beaten gold bearing basreliefs depicting what may have been bits   history  this forgotten people he  whom they had conversed across  wall    avenue  receive them about him   hundred or more men   same race all  clothed  flowing robes  all  beardless their attitude  more  fearful suspicion than antagonism they followed  newcomers  their eyes but spoke no word  them carthoris could not but notice  fact  though  city had been but  short time before surrounded   horde  bloodthirsty demons yet none   citizens appeared   armed nor  there sign  soldiery about he wondered if all  fighting men had sallied forth  one supreme effort  rout  foe leaving  city all unguarded he asked their host the man smiled “no creature other than  score or so  our sacred banths  left lothar today”  replied “but  soldiers—the bowmen” exclaimed carthoris “we saw thousands emerge  this very gate overwhelming  hordes  torquas  putting them  rout  their deadly arrows  their fierce banths” still  man smiled his knowing smile “look”  cried  pointed down  broad avenue before him carthoris  thuvia followed  direction indicated  there marching bravely   sunlight they saw advancing toward them  great army  bowmen “ah” exclaimed thuvia “they have returned through another gate or perchance these   troops  remained  defend  city” again  fellow smiled his uncanny smile “there  no soldiers  lothar”  said “look” both carthoris  thuvia had turned toward him while  spoke  now  they turned back again toward  advancing regiments their eyes went wide  astonishment   broad avenue before them   deserted   tomb “and those who marched out upon  hordes today” whispered carthoris “they too  unreal” the man nodded “but their arrows slew  green warriors” insisted thuvia “let us go before tario” replied  lotharian “he  tell you  which  deems  best you know i might tell you too much” “who  tario” asked carthoris “jeddak  lothar” replied  guide leading them up  broad avenue down which they had but  moment since seen  phantom army marching for half  hour they walked along lovely avenues between  most gorgeous buildings   two had ever seen few people   evidence carthoris could not but note  deserted appearance   mighty city at last they came   royal palace carthoris saw    distance  guessing  nature   magnificent pile wondered  even here there should  so little sign  activity  life not even  single guard  visible before  great entrance gate nor   gardens beyond into which  could see  there sign   myriad life  pulses within  precincts   royal estates   red jeddaks “here” said their guide “is  palace  tario” as  spoke carthoris again let his gaze rest upon  wondrous palace with  startled exclamation  rubbed his eyes  looked again no he could not  mistaken before  massive gate stood  score  sentries within  avenue leading   main building  lined  either side  ranks  bowmen the gardens  dotted  officers  soldiers moving quickly   fro  though bent upon  duties   minute what manner  people  these who could conjure  army out  thin air he glanced toward thuvia she too evidently had witnessed  transformation with  little shudder she pressed more closely toward him “what do you make  it” she whispered “it  most uncanny” “i cannot account  it” replied carthoris “unless we have gone mad” carthoris turned quickly toward  lotharian the fellow  smiling broadly “i thought  you just said  there  no soldiers  lothar” said  heliumite   gesture toward  guardsmen “what  these” “ask tario” replied  other “we shall soon  before him” nor   long before they entered  lofty chamber  one end  which  man reclined upon  rich couch  stood upon  high dais as  trio approached  man turned dreamy eyes sleepily upon them twenty feet   dais their conductor halted and whispering  thuvia  carthoris  follow his example threw himself headlong   floor then rising  hands  knees  commenced crawling toward  foot   throne swinging his head   fro  wiggling his body  you have seen  hound do when approaching  master thuvia glanced quickly toward carthoris he  standing erect  highheld head  arms folded across his broad chest a haughty smile curved his lips the man upon  dais  eyeing him intently  carthoris  helium  looking straight   other’s face “who  these jav” asked  man  him who crawled upon his belly along  floor “o tario most glorious jeddak” replied jav “these  strangers who came   hordes  torquas  our gates saying  they  prisoners   green men they tell strange tales  cities far beyond lothar” “arise jav” commanded tario “and ask these two why they show not  tario  respect   his due” jav arose  faced  strangers at sight  their erect positions his face went livid he leaped

apartment  empty save   four   dais yet  jav stepped back   menace   heliumite’s threatening attitude  latter found himself surrounded   score  bowmen from whence had they sprung both carthoris  thuvia looked their astonishment now  former’s sword leaped   scabbard    same instant  bowmen drew back their slim shafts tario had half raised himself upon one elbow for  first time  saw  full figure  thuvia who had been concealed behind  person  carthoris “enough” cried  jeddak raising  protesting hand but   very instant  sword   heliumite cut viciously   nearest antagonist as  keen edge reached  goal carthoris let  point fall   floor   wide eyes  stepped backward  consternation throwing  back  his left hand across his brow his steel had cut but empty air—his antagonist had vanished—there  no bowmen   room “it  evident  these  strangers” said tario  jav “let us first determine  they knowingly affronted us before we take measures  punishment” then  turned  carthoris but ever his gaze wandered   perfect lines  thuvia’s glorious figure which  harness   barsoomian princess accentuated rather than concealed “who  you”  asked “who knows not  etiquette   court   last  jeddaks” “i am carthoris prince  helium” replied  heliumite “and this  thuvia princess  ptarth in  courts  our fathers men do not prostrate themselves before royalty not since  first born tore their immortal goddess limb  limb have men crawled upon their bellies  any throne upon barsoom now think you   daughter  one mighty jeddak   son  another would so humiliate themselves” tario looked  carthoris   long time at last  spoke “there  no other jeddak upon barsoom than tario”  said “there  no other race than   lothar unless  hordes  torquas may  dignified  such  appellation lotharians  white your skins  red there  no women left upon barsoom your companion   woman” he half rose   couch leaning far forward  pointing  accusing finger  carthoris “you   lie”  shrieked “you  both lies  you dare  come before tario last  mightiest   jeddaks  barsoom  assert your reality some one shall pay well  this jav  unless i mistake   yourself who  dared thus flippantly  trifle   good nature  your jeddak “remove  man leave  woman we shall see if both  lies and later jav you shall suffer  your temerity there  few  us left but—komal must  fed go” carthoris could see  jav trembled   prostrated himself once more before his ruler  then rising turned toward  prince  helium “come”  said “and leave  princess  ptarth here alone” cried carthoris jav brushed closely past him whispering “follow me—he cannot harm her except  kill    can do whether you remain or not we had best go now—trust me” carthoris did not understand but something   urgency   other’s tone assured him  so  turned away but not without  glance toward thuvia  which  attempted  make her understand     her own interest   left her for answer she turned her back full upon him but not without first throwing him such  look  contempt  brought  scarlet  his cheek then  hesitated but jav seized him   wrist “come”  whispered “or   have  bowmen upon you  this time there   no escape did you not see how futile  your steel against thin air” carthoris turned unwillingly  follow as  two left  room  turned  his companion “if i may not kill thin air”  asked “how then shall i fear  thin air may kill me” “you saw  torquasians fall before  bowmen” asked jav carthoris nodded “so would you fall before them  without one single chance  selfdefence or revenge” as they talked jav led carthoris   small room  one   numerous towers   palace here  couches  jav bid  heliumite  seated for several minutes  lotharian eyed his prisoner  such carthoris now realized himself  be “i am half convinced  you  real”  said  last carthoris laughed “of course i am real”  said “what caused you  doubt it can you not see me feel me” “so may i see  feel  bowmen” replied jav “and yet we all know  they  least  not real” carthoris showed   expression  his face his puzzlement  each new reference   mysterious bowmen—the vanishing soldiery  lothar “what then may they be”  asked “you really do not know” asked jav carthoris shook his head negatively “i can almost believe  you have told us  truth   you  really  another part  barsoom or  another world but tell me  your own country have you no bowmen  strike terror   hearts   green hordesmen  they slay  company   fierce banths  war” “we have soldiers” replied carthoris “we   red race  all soldiers but we have no bowmen  defend us such  yours we defend ourselves” “you go out  get killed  your enemies” cried jav incredulously “certainly” replied carthoris “how do  lotharians” “you have seen” replied  other “we send out our deathless archers—deathless because they  lifeless existing only   imaginations  our enemies it  really our giant minds  defend us sending out legions  imaginary warriors  materialize before  mind’s eye   foe “they see them—they see their bows drawn back—they see their slender arrows speed  unerring precision toward their hearts and they die—killed   power  suggestion” “but  archers   slain” exclaimed carthoris “you call them deathless  yet i saw their dead bodies piled high upon  battlefield how may  be” “it  but  lend reality   scene” replied jav “we picture many  our own defenders killed   torquasians may not guess  there  really no flesh  blood creatures opposing them “once  truth became implanted  their minds    theory  many  us no longer would they fall prey   suggestion   deadly arrows  greater would   suggestion   truth   more powerful suggestion would prevail—it  law” “and  banths” questioned carthoris “they too  but creatures  suggestion” “some  them  real” replied jav “those  accompanied  archers  pursuit   torquasians  unreal like  archers they never returned but having served their purpose vanished   bowmen when  rout   enemy  assured “those  remained about  field  real those we loosed  scavengers  devour  bodies   dead  torquas this thing  demanded   realists among us i am  realist tario   etherealist “the etherealists maintain  there  no such thing  matter—that all  mind they say  none  us exists except   imagination  his fellows other than   intangible invisible mentality “according  tario   but necessary  we all unite  imagining  there  no dead torquasians beneath our walls  there   none nor any need  scavenging banths” “you then do not hold tario’s beliefs” asked carthoris “in part only” replied  lotharian “i believe  fact i know  there  some truly ethereal creatures tario  one i am convinced he  no existence except   imaginations  his people “of course    contention  all us realists  all etherealists  but figments   imagination they contend  no food  necessary nor do they eat but any one   most rudimentary intelligence must realize  food   necessity  creatures having actual existence” “yes” agreed carthoris “not having eaten today i can readily agree  you” “ah pardon me” exclaimed jav “pray  seated  satisfy your hunger”    wave  his hand  indicated  bountifully laden table  had not been there  instant before  spoke of  carthoris  positive   had searched  room diligently  his eyes several times “it  well” continued jav “that you did not fall into  hands   etherealist then indeed would you have gone hungry” “but” exclaimed carthoris “this  not real food—it  not here  instant since  real food does not materialize out  thin air” jav looked hurt “there  no real food or water  lothar”  said “nor  there been  countless ages upon such  you now see before you have we existed since  dawn  history upon such then may you exist” “but i thought you   realist” exclaimed carthoris “indeed” cried jav “what more realistic than this bounteous feast it  just here  we differ most   etherealists they claim    unnecessary  imagine food but we have found    maintenance  life we must thrice daily sit down  hearty meals “the food  one eats  supposed  undergo certain chemical changes

there  no such thing  substance all being created   substanceless matter   brain “we realists however know better we know  mind   power  maintain substance even though  may not  able  create substance—the latter  still  open question and so we know   order  maintain our physical bodies we must cause all our organs properly  function “this we accomplish  materializing foodthoughts   partaking   food thus created we chew we swallow we digest all our organs function precisely  if we had partaken  material food and what   result what must   result the chemical changes take place through both direct  indirect suggestion  we live  thrive” carthoris eyed  food before him it seemed real enough he lifted  morsel  his lips there  substance indeed and flavour  well yes even his palate  deceived jav watched him smiling   ate “is  not entirely satisfying”  asked “i must admit   is” replied carthoris “but tell me how does tario live   other etherealists who maintain  food  unnecessary” jav scratched his head “that   question we often discuss”  replied “it   strongest evidence we have   nonexistence   etherealists but who may know other than komal” “who  komal” asked carthoris “i heard your jeddak speak  him” jav bent low toward  ear   heliumite looking fearfully about before  spoke “komal   essence”  whispered “even  etherealists admit  mind itself must have substance  order  transmit  imaginings  appearance  substance for if there really  no such thing  substance  could not  suggested—what never  been cannot  imagined do you follow me” “i am groping” replied carthoris dryly “so  essence must  substance” continued jav “komal   essence   all   were he  maintained  substance he eats he eats  real to  explicit  eats  realists that  tario’s work “he says  inasmuch  we maintain  we alone  real we should   consistent admit  we alone  proper food  komal sometimes  today we find other food  him he  very fond  torquasians” “and komal   man” asked carthoris “he  all i told you” replied jav “i know not how  explain him  words  you  understand he   beginning   end all life emanates  komal since  substance which feeds  brain  imaginings radiates   body  komal “should komal cease  eat all life upon barsoom would cease  be he cannot die but  might cease  eat and thus  radiate” “and  feeds upon  men  women  your belief” cried carthoris “women” exclaimed jav “there  no women  lothar the last   lotharian females perished ages since upon  cruel  terrible journey across  muddy plains  fringed  halfdried seas when  green hordes scourged us across  world  this our last hidingplace—our impregnable fortress  lothar “scarce twenty thousand men  all  countless millions  our race lived  reach lothar among us  no women  no children all these had perished   way “as time went on we too  dying   race fast approaching extinction when  great truth  revealed  us  mind  all many more died before we perfected our powers but  last we  able  defy death when we fully understood  death  merely  state  mind “then came  creation  mindpeople or rather  materialization  imaginings we first put these  practical use when  torquasians discovered our retreat  fortunate  us     required ages  search upon their part before they found  single tiny entrance   valley  lothar “that day we threw our first bowmen against them the intention  purely  frighten them away   vast numbers  bowmen which we could muster upon our walls all lothar bristled   bows  arrows  our ethereal host “but  torquasians did not frighten they  lower than  beasts—they know no fear they rushed upon our walls  standing upon  shoulders  others they built human approaches   wall tops     very point  surging  upon us  overwhelming us “not  arrow had been discharged  our bowmen—we did but cause them  run   fro along  wall top screaming taunts  threats   enemy “presently i thought  attempt  thing—the great thing i centred all my mighty intellect upon  bowmen  my own creation—each  us produces  directs  many bowmen  his mentality  imagination  capable of “i caused them  fit arrows  their bows   first time i made them take aim   hearts   green men i made  green men see all this  then i made them see  arrows fly  i made them think   points pierced their hearts “it  all   necessary by hundreds they toppled  our walls  when my fellows saw what i had done they  quick  follow my example so  presently  hordes  torquas had retreated beyond  range  our arrows “we might have killed them  any distance but one rule  war we have maintained   first—the rule  realism we do nothing or rather we cause our bowmen  do nothing within sight   enemy   beyond  understanding   foe otherwise they might guess  truth   would   end  us “but after  torquasians had retreated beyond bowshot they turned upon us  their terrible rifles   constant popping  us made life miserable within our walls “so then i bethought  scheme  hurl our bowmen through  gates upon them you have seen this day how well  works for ages they have come down upon us  intervals but always   same results” “and all this  due  your intellect jav” asked carthoris “i should think  you would  high   councils  your people” “i am” replied jav proudly “i am next  tario” “but why then your cringing manner  approaching  throne” “tario demands it he  jealous  me he only awaits  slightest excuse  feed me  komal he fears  i may some day usurp his power” carthoris suddenly sprang   table “jav”  exclaimed “i am  beast here i have been eating my fill while  princess  ptarth may perchance  still without food let us return  find some means  furnishing her  nourishment” the lotharian shook his head “tario would not permit it”  said “he will doubtless make  etherealist  her” “but i must go  her” insisted carthoris “you say  there  no women  lothar then she must  among men  if this  so i intend   near where i may defend her if  need arises” “tario  have his way” insisted jav “he sent you away  you may not return until  sends  you” “then i shall go without waiting   sent for” “do not forget  bowmen” cautioned jav “i do not forget them” replied carthoris but  did not tell jav   remembered something else   lotharian had let drop—something   but  conjecture possibly  yet one well worth pinning  forlorn hope to should necessity arise carthoris started  leave  room jav stepped before him barring his way “i have learned  like you red man”  said “but do not forget  tario  still my jeddak   tario  commanded  you remain here” carthoris  about  reply when there came faintly   ears  both  woman’s cry  help with  sweep  his arm  prince  helium brushed  lotharian aside   drawn sword sprang into  corridor without chapter viii the hall of doom as thuvia  ptarth saw carthoris depart   presence  tario leaving her alone   man  sudden qualm  terror seized her there   air  mystery pervading  stately chamber its furnishings  appointments bespoke wealth  culture  carried  suggestion   room  often  scene  royal functions which filled    capacity and yet nowhere about her  antechamber or corridor  there sign  any other being than herself   recumbent figure  tario  jeddak who watched her through halfclosed eyes   gorgeous trappings  his regal couch for  time after  departure  jav  carthoris  man eyed her intently then  spoke “come nearer”  said and  she approached “whose creature  you who  dared materialize his imaginings  woman it  contrary   customs   royal edicts  lothar tell me woman  whose brain have you sprung jav’s no do not deny it i know   could  no other than  envious realist he seeks  tempt me he would see me fall beneath  spell  your charms  then he your master would direct my destiny and—my end i see  all i see  all” the blood  indignation  anger had been rising  thuvia’s face her chin  up  haughty curve upon her perfect lips “i know naught” she cried “of what you  prating i am thuvia princess  ptarth i am no man’s ‘creature’ never before today did i lay eyes upon him you call jav nor upon your ridiculous city  which even  greatest nations  barsoom have never dreamed “my charms  not  you nor such  you they  not  sale or barter even though  price   real throne and   using them  win your worse than futile power—” she ended her sentence   shrug  her shapely shoulders   little scornful laugh when she had finished tario  sitting upon  edge  his couch his feet upon  floor he  leaning forward  eyes no longer half closed but wide   startled expression  them he did not seem  note  lèse majesté  her words  manner there  evidently something more startling  compelling about her speech than that slowly  came  his feet “by  fangs  komal”  muttered “but you  real a real woman no dream no vain  foolish figment   mind” he took  step toward her  hands outstretched “come”  whispered “come woman for countless ages have i dreamed  some day you would come and now  you  here i can scarce believe  testimony  my eyes even now knowing  you  real i still half dread  you may   lie” thuvia shrank back she thought  man mad her hand stole   jewelled hilt  her dagger the man saw  move  stopped a cunning expression entered his eyes then they became  once dreamy  penetrating  they fairly bored into  girl’s brain thuvia suddenly felt  change coming over her what  cause   she did not guess but somehow  man before her began  assume  new relationship within her heart no longer    strange  mysterious enemy but  old  trusted friend her hand slipped   dagger’s hilt tario came closer he spoke gentle friendly words  she answered him   voice  seemed hers  yet another’s he  beside her now his hand  upon her shoulder his eyes  downbent toward hers she looked up into his face his gaze seemed  bore straight through her  some hidden spring  sentiment within her her lips parted  sudden awe  wonder   strange revealment  her inner self   being laid bare before her consciousness she had known tario  ever he  more than friend  her she moved  little closer  him in one swift flood  light she knew  truth she loved tario jeddak  lothar she had always loved him the man seeing  success  his strategy could not restrain  faint smile  satisfaction whether there  something   expression  his face or whether  carthoris  helium   far chamber   palace came  more powerful suggestion who may say but something there   suddenly dispelled  strange hypnotic influence   man as though  mask had been torn  her eyes thuvia suddenly saw tario  she had formerly seen him and accustomed  she    strange manifestations  highly developed mentality which  common upon barsoom she quickly guessed enough   truth  know  she   grave danger quickly she took  step backward tearing herself  his grasp but  momentary contact had aroused within tario all  longburied passions  his loveless existence with  muffled cry  sprang upon her throwing his arms about her  attempting  drag her lips  his “woman”  cried “lovely woman tario would make you queen  lothar listen  me listen   love   last   jeddaks  barsoom” thuvia struggled  free herself  his embrace “stop creature” she cried “stop i do not love you stop or i shall scream  help” tario laughed  her face “‘scream  help’”  mimicked “and who within  halls  lothar  there who might come  answer  your call who would dare enter  presence  tario unsummoned” “there  one” she replied “who would come and coming dare  cut you down upon your own throne if  thought  you had offered affront  thuvia  ptarth” “who jav” asked tario “not jav nor any other softskinned lotharian” she replied “but  real man  real warrior—carthoris  helium” again  man laughed  her “you forget  bowmen”  reminded her “what could your red warrior accomplish against my fearless legions” again  caught her roughly  him dragging her towards his couch “if you  not  my queen”  said “you shall  my slave” “neither” cried  girl as she spoke  single word there   quick move  her right hand tario releasing her staggered back both hands pressed  his side at  same instant  room filled  bowmen  then  jeddak  lothar sank senseless   marble floor at  instant   lost consciousness  bowmen  about  release their arrows into thuvia’s heart involuntarily she gave  single cry  help though she knew  not even carthoris  helium could save her now then she closed her eyes  waited   end no slender shafts pierced her tender side she raised her lids  see what stayed  hand  her executioners the room  empty save  herself   still form   jeddak  lothar lying  her feet  little pool  crimson staining  white marble   floor beside him tario  unconscious thuvia  amazed where   bowmen why had they not loosed their shafts what could  all mean an instant before  room had been mysteriously filled  armed men evidently called  protect their jeddak yet now   evidence  her deed plain before them they had vanished  mysteriously  they had come leaving her alone   body  their ruler into whose side she had slipped her long keen blade the girl glanced apprehensively about first  signs   return   bowmen  then  some means  escape the wall behind  dais  pierced  two small doorways hidden  heavy hangings thuvia  running quickly towards one  these when she heard  clank   warrior’s metal   end   apartment behind her ah if she had but  instant more  time she could have reached  screening arras and perchance have found some avenue  escape behind it but now   too late—she had been discovered with  feeling   akin  apathy she turned  meet her fate  there before her running swiftly across  broad chamber  her side  carthoris his naked longsword gleaming  his hand for days she had doubted  intentions   heliumite she had thought him  party  her abduction since fate had thrown them together she had scarce favoured him  more than  most perfunctory replies  his remarks unless  such times   weird  uncanny happenings  lothar had surprised her out  her reserve she knew  carthoris  helium would fight  her but whether  save her  himself or another she   doubt he knew  she  promised  kulan tith jeddak  kaol but if  had been instrumental  her abduction his motives could not  prompted  loyalty  his friend or regard  her honour and yet  she saw him coming across  marble floor   audience chamber  tario  lothar his fine eyes filled  apprehension  her safety his splendid figure personifying all   finest   fighting men  martial mars she could not believe  any faintest trace  perfidy lurked beneath so glorious  exterior never she thought  all her life had  sight  any man been so welcome  her it   difficulty  she refrained  rushing forward  meet him she knew   loved her but  time she recalled  she  promised  kulan tith not even might she trust herself  show too great gratitude   heliumite lest  misunderstand carthoris   her side now his quick glance had taken   scene within  room—the still figure   jeddak sprawled upon  floor—the girl hastening toward  shrouded exit “did  harm you thuvia”  asked she held up her crimsoned blade   might see it “no” she said “he did not harm me” a grim smile lighted carthoris’ face “praised  our first ancestor”  murmured “and now let us see if we may not make good our escape  this accursed city before  lotharians discover  their jeddak  no more” with  firm authority  sat so well upon him  whose veins flowed  blood  john carter  virginia  dejah thoris  helium  grasped her hand and turning back across  hall strode toward  great doorway through which jav had brought them into  presence   jeddak earlier   day they had almost reached  threshold when  figure sprang into  apartment through another entrance it  jav he too took   scene within   glance carthoris turned  face him his sword ready  his hand  his great body shielding  slender figure   girl “come jav  lothar”  cried “let us face  issue  once  only one  us may leave this chamber alive  thuvia  ptarth” then seeing   man wore no sword  exclaimed “bring  your bowmen then or come  us  my prisoner until we have safely passed  outer portals  thy ghostly city” “you have killed tario” exclaimed jav ignoring  other’s challenge “you have killed tario i see his blood upon  floor—real blood—real death tario was after all  real  i yet    etherealist he would not materialize his sustenance can    they  right well we too  right and all these ages we have been quarrelling—each saying   other  wrong “however   dead now of  i am glad now shall jav come into his own now shall jav  jeddak  lothar” as  finished tario opened his eyes  then quickly sat up “traitor assassin”  screamed  then “kadar kadar” which   barsoomian  guard jav went sickly white he fell upon his belly wriggling toward tario “oh my jeddak my jeddak”  whimpered “jav had no hand  this jav your faithful jav but just this instant entered  apartment  find you lying prone upon  floor  these two strangers about  leave how  happened i know not believe me most glorious jeddak” “cease knave” cried tario “i heard your words ‘however   dead now of  i am glad now shall jav come into his own now shall jav  jeddak  lothar’ “at last traitor i have found you out your own words have condemned you  surely   acts  these red creatures have sealed their fates—unless—” he paused “unless  woman—” but  got no further carthoris guessed what  would have said  before  words could  uttered  had sprung forward  struck  man across  mouth  his open palm tario frothed  rage  mortification “and should you again affront  princess  ptarth” warned  heliumite “i shall forget  you wear no sword—not  ever may i control my itching sword hand” tario shrank back toward  little doorways behind  dais he  trying  speak but so hideously   muscles  his face working   could utter no word  several minutes at last  managed  articulate intelligibly “die”  shrieked “die”  then  turned toward  exit  his back jav leaped forward screaming  terror “have pity tario have pity remember  long ages  i have served you faithfully remember all  i have done  lothar do not condemn me now   death hideous save me save me” but tario only laughed  mocking laugh  continued  back toward  hangings  hid  little doorway jav turned toward carthoris “stop him”  screamed “stop him if you love life let him not leave this room”    spoke  leaped  pursuit  his jeddak carthoris followed jav’s example but  “last   jeddaks  barsoom”  too quick  them by  time they reached  arras behind which  had disappeared they found  heavy stone door blocking their further progress jav sank   floor   spasm  terror “come man” cried carthoris “we  not dead yet let us hasten   avenues  make  attempt  leave  city we  still alive  while we live we may yet endeavour  direct our own destinies of what avail  sink spineless   floor come   man” jav but shook his head “did you not hear him call  guards”  moaned “ah if we could have but intercepted him then there might have been hope but alas   too quick  us” “well well” exclaimed carthoris impatiently “what if  did call  guards there   time enough  worry about  after they come—at present i see no indication  they have any idea  overexerting themselves  obey their jeddak’s summons” jav shook his head mournfully “you do not understand”  said “the guards have already come—and gone they have done their work  we  lost look   various exits” carthoris  thuvia turned their eyes   direction   several doorways which pierced  walls   great chamber each  tightly closed  huge stone doors “well” asked carthoris “we   die  death” whispered jav faintly further than   would not say he just sat upon  edge   jeddak’s couch  waited carthoris moved  thuvia’s side and standing there  naked sword  let his brave eyes roam ceaselessly about  great chamber  no foe might spring upon them unseen for what seemed hours no sound broke  silence  their living tomb no sign gave their executioners   time or manner  their death the suspense  terrible even carthoris  helium began  feel  terrible strain upon his nerves if  could but know how  whence  hand  death   strike  could meet  unafraid but  suffer longer  hideous tension  this blighting ignorance   plans  their assassins  telling upon him grievously thuvia  ptarth drew quite close  him she felt safer   feel  his arm against hers    contact  her  man took  new grip upon himself with his oldtime smile  turned toward her “it would seem  they  trying  frighten us  death”  said laughing “and shame  upon me  i should confess it i think they  close  accomplishing their designs upon me” she  about  make some reply when  fearful shriek broke   lips   lotharian “the end  coming”  cried “the end  coming the floor the floor oh komal  merciful” thuvia  carthoris did not need  look   floor   aware   strange movement   taking place slowly  marble flagging  sinking  all directions toward  centre at first  movement being gradual  scarce noticeable but presently  angle   floor became such  one might stand easily only  bending one knee considerably jav  shrieking still  clawing   royal couch  had already commenced  slide toward  centre   room where both thuvia  carthoris suddenly noted  small orifice which grew  diameter   floor assumed more closely  funnellike contour now  became more  more difficult  cling   dizzy inclination   smooth  polished marble carthoris tried  support thuvia but himself commenced  slide  slip toward  everenlarging aperture better  cling   smooth stone  kicked off his sandals  zitidar hide   his bare feet braced himself against  sickening tilt   same time throwing his arms supportingly about  girl in her terror her own hands clasped about  man’s neck her cheek  close  his death unseen   unknown form seemed close upon them  because unseen  unknowable infinitely more terrifying “courage my princess”  whispered she looked up into his face  see smiling lips above hers  brave eyes untouched  terror drinking deeply  her own then  floor sagged  tilted more swiftly there   sudden slipping rush  they  precipitated toward  aperture jav’s screams rose weird  horrible  their ears  then  three found themselves piled upon  royal couch  tario which had stuck within  aperture   base   marble funnel for  moment they breathed more freely but presently they discovered   aperture  continuing  enlarge the couch slipped downward jav shrieked again there   sickening sensation  they felt all let go beneath them  they fell through darkness   unknown death chapter ix the battle in the plain the distance   bottom   funnel   floor   chamber beneath  could not have been great  all three   victims  tario’s wrath alighted unscathed carthoris still clasping thuvia tightly  his breast came   ground catlike upon his feet breaking  shock   girl scarce had his feet touched  rough stone flagging  this new chamber than his sword flashed out ready  instant use but though  room  lighted there  no sign  enemy about carthoris looked toward jav the man  pasty white  fear “what    our fate” asked  heliumite “tell me man shake off your terror long enough  tell me so i may  prepared  sell my life     princess  ptarth  dearly  possible” “komal” whispered jav “we    devoured  komal” “your deity” asked carthoris the lotharian nodded his head then  pointed toward  low doorway  one end   chamber “from thence   come upon us lay aside your puny sword fool it  but enrage him  more  make our sufferings  worse” carthoris smiled gripping his longsword  more firmly presently jav gave  horrified moan   same time pointing toward  door “he  come”  whimpered carthoris  thuvia looked   direction  lotharian had indicated expecting  see some strange  fearful creature  human form but  their astonishment they saw  broad head  greatmaned shoulders   huge banth  largest  either ever had seen slowly   dignity  mighty beast advanced into  room jav had fallen   floor   wriggling his body   same servile manner   had adopted toward tario he spoke   fierce beast   would have spoken   human being pleading    mercy carthoris stepped between thuvia   banth his sword ready  contest  beast’s victory over them thuvia turned toward jav “is this komal your god” she asked jav nodded affirmatively the girl smiled  then brushing past carthoris she stepped swiftly toward  growling carnivore in low firm tones she spoke    she had spoken   banths   golden cliffs   scavengers before  walls  lothar the beast ceased  growling with lowered head  catlike purr  came slinking   girl’s feet thuvia turned toward carthoris “it  but  banth” she said “we have nothing  fear  it” carthoris smiled “i did not fear it”  replied “for i too believed    only  banth  i have my longsword” jav sat up  gazed   spectacle before him—the slender girl weaving her fingers   tawny mane   huge creature   had thought divine while komal rubbed his hideous snout against her side “so this  your god” laughed thuvia jav looked bewildered he scarce knew whether  dare chance offending komal or not  so strong   power  superstition  even though we know  we have been reverencing  sham yet still we hesitate  admit  validity  our newfound convictions “yes”  said “this  komal for ages  enemies  tario have been hurled  this pit  fill his maw  komal must  fed” “is there any way out  this chamber   avenues   city” asked carthoris jav shrugged “i do not know”  replied “never have i been here before nor ever have i cared  do so” “come” suggested thuvia “let us explore there must   way out” together  three approached  doorway through which komal had entered  apartment    have witnessed their deaths beyond   lowroofed lair   small door   far end this  their delight opened   lifting   ordinary latch letting them into  circular arena surrounded  tiers  seats “here  where komal  fed  public” explained jav “had tario dared  would have been here  our fates had been sealed but  feared too much thy keen blade red man  so  hurled us all downward   pit i did not know how closely connected   two chambers now we may easily reach  avenues   city gates only  bowmen may dispute  right  way and knowing their secret i doubt  they have power  harm us” another door led   flight  steps  rose   arena level upward through  seats   exit   back   hall beyond this   straight broad corridor running directly through  palace   gardens   side no one appeared  question them  they advanced mighty komal pacing   girl’s side “where   people   palace—the jeddak’s retinue” asked carthoris “even   city streets  we came through i scarce saw sign   human being yet all about  evidences   mighty population” jav sighed “poor lothar”  said “it  indeed  city  ghosts there  scarce  thousand  us left who once  numbered   millions our great city  peopled   creatures  our own imaginings for our own needs we do not take  trouble  materialize these peoples  our brain yet they  apparent  us “even now i see great throngs lining  avenue hastening   fro   round  their duties i see women  children laughing   balconies—these we  forbidden  materialize but yet i see them—they  here    but why not”  mused “no longer need i fear tario—he  done his worst  failed why not indeed “stay friends”  continued “would you see lothar  all her glory” carthoris  thuvia nodded their assent more out  courtesy than because they fully grasped  import  his mutterings jav gazed  them penetratingly   instant then   wave  his hand cried “look” the sight  met them  aweinspiring where before there had been naught but deserted pavements  scarlet swards yawning windows  tenantless doors now swarmed  countless multitude  happy laughing people “it   past” said jav   low voice “they do not see us—they but live  old dead past  ancient lothar—the dead  crumbled lothar  antiquity which stood upon  shore  throxus mightiest   five oceans “see those fine upstanding men swinging along  broad avenue see  young girls   women smile upon them see  men greet them  love  respect those  seafarers coming up  their ships which lie   quays   city’s edge “brave men they—ah but  glory  lothar  faded see their weapons they alone bore arms  they crossed  five seas  strange places where dangers were with their passing passed  martial spirit   lotharians leaving   ages rolled by  race  spineless cowards “we hated war  so we trained not our youth  warlike ways thus followed our undoing  when  seas dried   green hordes encroached upon us we could do naught but flee but we remembered  seafaring bowmen   days  our glory—it   memory  these which we hurl upon our enemies” as jav ceased speaking  picture faded  once more  three took up their way toward  distant gates along deserted avenues twice they sighted lotharians  flesh  blood at sight  them   huge banth which they must have recognized  komal  citizens turned  fled “they  carry word  our flight  tario” cried jav “and soon   send his bowmen after us let us hope  our theory  correct   their shafts  powerless against minds cognizant  their unreality otherwise we  doomed “explain red man   woman  truths  i have explained  you  she may meet  arrows   stronger countersuggestion  immunity” carthoris did  jav bid him but they came   great gates without sign  pursuit developing here jav set  motion  mechanism  rolled  huge wheellike gate aside   moment later  three accompanied   banth stepped out into  plain before lothar scarce had they covered  hundred yards when  sound  many men shouting arose behind them as they turned they saw  company  bowmen debouching upon  plain   gate through which they had but just passed upon  wall above  gate   number  lotharians among whom jav recognized tario the jeddak stood glaring  them evidently concentrating all  forces  his trained mind upon them that   making  supreme effort  render his imaginary creatures deadly  apparent jav turned white  commenced  tremble at  crucial moment  appeared  lose  courage  his conviction the great banth turned back toward  advancing bowmen  growled carthoris placed himself between thuvia   enemy and facing them awaited  outcome  their charge suddenly  inspiration came  carthoris “hurl your own bowmen against tario’s”  cried  jav “let us see  materialized battle between two mentalities” the suggestion seemed  hearten  lotharian   another moment  three stood behind solid ranks  huge bowmen who hurled taunts  menaces   advancing company emerging   walled city jav   new man  moment his battalions stood between him  tario one could almost have sworn  man believed these creatures  his strange hypnotic power   real flesh  blood with hoarse battle cries they charged  bowmen  tario barbed shafts flew thick  fast men fell   ground  red  gore carthoris  thuvia had difficulty  reconciling  reality   all  their knowledge   truth they saw utan after utan march   gate  perfect step  reinforce  outnumbered company which tario had first sent forth  arrest them they saw jav’s forces grow correspondingly until all about them rolled  sea  fighting cursing warriors   dead lay  heaps about  field jav  tario seemed  have forgotten all else beside  struggling bowmen  surged   fro filling  broad field between  forest   city the wood loomed close behind thuvia  carthoris the latter cast  glance toward jav “come”  whispered   girl “let them fight out their empty battle—neither evidently  power  harm  other they  like two controversialists hurling words  one another while they  engaged we may  well  devoting our energies   attempt  find  passage through  cliffs   plain beyond” as  spoke jav turning   battle   instant caught his words he saw  girl move  accompany  heliumite a cunning look leaped   lotharian’s eyes the thing  lay beyond  look had been deep  his heart since first  had laid eyes upon thuvia  ptarth he had not recognized it however until now  she seemed about  pass out  his existence he centred his mind upon  heliumite   girl   instant carthoris saw thuvia  ptarth step forward  outstretched hand he  surprised  this sudden softening toward him      full heart   let his fingers close upon hers  together they turned away  forgotten lothar into  woods  bent their steps toward  distant mountains as  lotharian had turned toward them thuvia had been surprised  hear carthoris suddenly

through  underground passages    distinguishing feature  all barsoomian cities modern  well  ancient his captors suddenly emerged into  moonlight   courtyard far   central plaza immediately carthoris saw      power   tribe   great white apes  barsoom all  had caused him doubt before    identity  his attackers   hairiness  their breasts   white apes  entirely hairless except   great shock bristling  their heads now  saw  cause   which had deceived him—across  chest  each  them  strips  hairy hide usually  banth  imitation   harness   green warriors who so often camped  their deserted city carthoris had read   existence  tribes  apes  seemed   progressing slowly toward higher standards  intelligence into  hands  such  realized  had fallen but—what  their intentions toward him as  glanced about  courtyard  saw fully fifty   hideous beasts squatting  their haunches    little distance  him another human being closely guarded as his eyes met those  his fellowcaptive  smile lit  other’s face and “kaor red man” burst  his lips it  kar komak  bowman “kaor” cried carthoris  response “how came you here  what befell  princess” “red men like yourself descended  mighty ships  sailed

afterward came these  dragged me hither and what  you red man” carthoris related all  had befallen him    two men talked  great apes squatted about them watching them intently “what  we  do now” asked  bowman “our case looks rather hopeless” replied carthoris ruefully “these creatures  born maneaters why they have not already devoured us i cannot imagine—there”  whispered “see the end  coming” kar komak looked   direction carthoris indicated  see  huge ape advancing   mighty bludgeon “it  thus they like best  kill their prey” said carthoris “must we die without  struggle” asked kar komak “not i” replied carthoris “though i know how futile our best defence must  against these mighty brutes oh   longsword” “or  good bow” added kar komak “and  utan  bowmen” at  words carthoris half sprang  his feet only   dragged roughly down  his guard “kar komak”  cried “why cannot you do what tario  jav did they had no bowmen other than those  their own creation you must know  secret  their power call forth your own utan kar komak” the lotharian looked  carthoris  wideeyed astonishment   full purport   suggestion bore  upon his understanding “why not”  murmured the savage ape bearing  mighty bludgeon  slinking toward carthoris the heliumite’s fingers  working   kept his eyes upon his executioner kar komak bent his gaze penetratingly upon  apes the effort  his mind  evidenced   sweat upon his contracted brows the creature    slay  red man  almost within arm’s reach  his prey when carthoris heard  hoarse shout   opposite side   courtyard in common   squatting apes   demon   club  turned   direction   sound  see  company  sturdy bowmen rushing   doorway   nearby building with screams  rage  apes leaped  their feet  meet  charge a volley  arrows met them halfway sending  dozen rolling lifeless   ground then  apes closed  their adversaries all their attention  occupied   attackers—even  guard had deserted  prisoners  join   battle “come” whispered kar komak “now may we escape while their attention  diverted  us  my bowmen” “and leave those brave fellows leaderless” cried carthoris whose loyal nature revolted   merest suggestion  such  thing kar komak laughed “you forget”  said “that they  but thin air—figments  my brain they  vanish unscathed when we have no further need  them praised  your first ancestor redman  you thought  this chance  time it would never have occurred  me  imagine  i might wield  same power  brought me into existence” “you  right” said carthoris “still i hate  leave them though there  naught else  do”  so  two turned   courtyard  making their way into one   broad avenues crept stealthily   shadows   building toward  great central plaza upon which   buildings occupied   green warriors when they visited  deserted city when they had come   plaza’s edge carthoris halted “wait here”  whispered “i go  fetch thoats since  foot we may never hope  escape  clutches  these green fiends” to reach  courtyard where  thoats  kept   necessary

could not even scratch  tough barsoomian glass   windows would have shattered  nothing less than  heavy sledge   hands   strong man the door   lock  impregnable there  no escape and they had stripped her  her weapons so  she could not even anticipate  hour  her doom thus robbing them   satisfaction  witnessing her last moments when would they come would astok do  deed  his own hands she doubted   had  courage  it at heart    coward—she had known  since first she had heard him brag as  visitor   court  her father  had sought  impress her  his valour she could not help but compare him  another and  whom would  affianced bride compare  unsuccessful suitor with her betrothed and did thuvia  ptarth now measure astok  dusar   standards  kulan tith jeddak  kaol she  about  die her thoughts  her

quickening  heart leaping   memory  this other smile—the smile  she would never see again with  little halfsob  girl sank   pile  silks  furs   tumbled  confusion beneath  east windows burying her face  her arms in  corridor outside her prisonroom two men had paused  heated argument “i tell you again astok” one  saying “that i shall not do this thing unless you  present   room” there  little   respect due royalty   tone   speaker’s voice the other noting it flushed “do not impose too far upon my friendship  you vas kor”  snapped “there   limit  my patience” “there  no question  royal

reasonable request  you  present thus sharing  guilt  me why should i bear  all” the younger man scowled but  advanced toward  locked door    swung  upon  hinges  entered  room beyond   side  vas kor across  chamber  girl hearing them enter rose  her feet  faced them under  soft copper  her skin she blanched just  trifle but her eyes  brave  level   haughty tilt  her firm little chin  eloquent  loathing  contempt “you still prefer death” asked astok “to you yes” replied  girl coldly the prince  dusar turned  vas kor  nodded the noble drew his shortsword  crossed  room toward thuvia “kneel”  commanded “i prefer  die standing” she replied “as you will” said vas kor feeling  point  his blade  his left thumb “in  name  nutus jeddak  dusar”  cried  ran quickly toward her “in  name  carthoris

always  kept his flashing blade between  girl  her enemies yet  managed  force them hither  thither about  room calling   girl  follow close behind him until   too late neither vas kor nor astok dreamed   which lay   panthan’s mind but  last   fellow stood  his back toward  door both understood—they  penned  their own prison  now  intruder could slay them  his will  thuvia  ptarth  bolting

dusarian prince run swiftly   opposite side   chamber touch something   wall  sent  great panel swinging inward  disappear into  black vault beyond it  done so quickly   no possibility could they have intercepted him carthoris fearful lest vas kor might similarly elude him or astok return immediately  reinforcements sprang viciously  upon his antagonist   moment later  headless body   dusarian noble rolled upon  ersite floor “come” cried carthoris “there  no time   lost astok   back   moment  enough warriors  overpower me” but astok had no such plan  mind  such  move would have meant  spreading   fact among  palace gossips   ptarthian princess   prisoner   east tower quickly would  word have come  his father  no amount  falsifying could have explained away  facts   jeddak’s

longsword so  astok had  parry  dozen vicious cuts before  could disengage himself  flee back down  runway a moment later carthoris  thuvia entered  corridor   secret chamber “well kar komak” asked  heliumite “it  fortunate  you left me here red man” said  bowman “i but just now intercepted one who seemed overanxious  reach this door—it   whom they call astok prince  dusar” carthoris smiled “where   now”  asked “he escaped my blade  ran down this corridor” replied kar komak “we must lose no time then” exclaimed carthoris “he  have  guard upon us yet” together  three hastened along

stranded airship the nationality   latter  could not make out  so great  distance it  not necessary  change  course   thuria  permit  passing directly above  scene  battle but carthoris dropped his craft  few hundred feet   might have  better  closer view if  ship    friendly power  could do no less than stop  direct his guns upon her enemies though   precious freight  carried  scarcely felt justified  landing   could offer but two swords  reinforcement—scarce enough  warrant jeopardizing  safety   princess  ptarth as they came close above  stricken ship they could see   would  but  question  minutes before  green horde would swarm across  armoured bulwarks  glut  ferocity  their bloodlust upon  defenders “it would  futile  descend” said carthoris  thuvia “the craft may even

kar komak turned toward  heliumite  grim smile upon his lips “why should we fight”  asked “against such fearful odds there  another way—a better way look” he pointed toward  companionway  led below

she asked “where  you going carthoris” “with kar komak  bowman”  replied “there   fighting  forgetfulness” the girl put her hands before her eyes  though  shut out some mighty temptation  her sight “may my ancestors have mercy upon me” she cried “if i say  thing i have no right  say but i cannot see you cast your life away carthoris prince  helium stay my chieftain stay—i love you” a cough behind them brought both about  there they saw standing not two paces  them kulan tith jeddak  kaol for  long moment none spoke then kulan tith cleared his throat “i could not help hearing all
