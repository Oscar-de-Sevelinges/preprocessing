presenting  same   clear  concise manner so  any one  following  various manipulations given   enabled  succeed if there  any one part   process  daguerreotype  which operators fail more than all others    not properly preparing  plate it  truly been said   would take  volume  describe all  methods  have been suggested  polishing  plate i shall confine myself   following description which  been successfully practised also most generally adopted  our operators  i believe equal if not superior  any other method yet   same time   not  so much importance what particular method  employed so    thoroughly  skillfully carried out there   general tendency  beginners  slight this operation hence  necessity  adopting  system which precludes  possibility  doing so during many years’ study  practice   art i have tried numerous methods  substances   better accomplishment   end  view  have finally settled upon  following  being so far  experience allows me  judge  modus operandi best suited  all circumstances under no condition would i approve   method less rigorous or precise the operator being provided   bottle  finely prepared rotten stone cover  mouth   bottle   piece  thick paper this perforated   pin so   rotten stone can  dusted   plate fasten  plate   holder take  rotten stone becker’s can always  depended upon  dust  lightly until  surface  freely covered now drop   plate’s surface  few drops   alcoholic solution  this solution  composed  equal parts  alcohol  water   summer   winter three parts alcohol  one  water  few drops  potassa solution may  added   known  have  decided effect upon  plate take  patch  canton flannel  order  prevent  moisture   hand  should have  thick firm texture  this rub  plate  circles across then back covering onehalf   former row  circles  each crossing until you have gone over  plate  back   point  beginning occupying  least half  minute   operation   small plate  so  proportion   other sizes care should  observed  keep  patch wet   alcoholic solution forming  paste   surface   plate  motion   hand should  brisk  free not hurried   pressure about equal     pound weight when  cotton  disposed  adhere   plate  slip  under  finger spread  fore  middle fingers  little apart then pressing down bring them together  such  manner   form  fold   cloth between them  which means you  hold  perfectly secure avoid wetting  fingers  should they perspire wipe them often   moisture penetrating  cotton  coming  contact   plate would cause streaks  would  difficult  remove i  here remark  many operators use much more cotton flannel than there  need of i have found  my experience   single patch about one  half inch square   better  cleaning  number  plates than  new piece  every plate this   case   wet    dryrubbing two or three pieces   found  answer thus  four or five cloths  dozen plates may  prepared some operators use prepared cotton  think  more convenient than  flannel this may  had prepared free  seeds    very perfect state if wished in going over  plate great care should  observed  touching  surface  equally  possible the greatest care should  taken neither  touch  plate   fingers nor  part   cotton flannel which   come  contact   surface take  clean piece  flannel  one corner snap  smartly  free   dust  loose fibres lay  faceside upward dust   little fine rotten stone  this polish around or across or  circles lightly  briskly passing gradually over  whole surface   plate   done before   wet the plate should now exhibit  bright clear uniform surface   strong metallic lustre perfectly free  any appearance  film if not  last polished should  continued until  effect  obtained  when once obtained  plate  ready  buffing buffing  plate—there   variety  ways  means employed  this part   operation some choose wheels  others prefer  ordinary handbuff i have been unable  detect any peculiar advantage   use   wheel except   facility   operation no doubt however but there   saving  time particularly   preparation   larger plates for general use we have not seen  wheel better adapted  this purpose than  one patented  messrs lewis it  generally well  use  handbuff before placing  plate   wheel this   order  prevent  far  possible  dust or other substance  may    surface   plate  coming  contact   cover   wheel i  here follow out  use   handbuffs two  necessary  they  mostly used in  morning before using  buffs brush both  clean  possible  order  free them  dust then   blade   pair  shears held perpendicular rub  buffs  end  end then knock them both together  order  free them  all dust or other substances occasionally exposing them   sun or   fire with one   buffs reserving  finest  softest   last operation powder  face  fine rouge  brush off slightly leaving only  finest particles  it every operator should have two plateholders one  cleaning  one  buffing  plate  when using only one  rotten stone  liable  get   buff  scratch  plate rest  fingers   left hand   back   buff near  farther end  about  same pressure   cleaning while   right you bear   handle  correspond  give  buff  free easy horizontal motion passing  very nearly  whole length over  plate each time continue this operation  such  manner   plate   all parts   surface have received  equal amount  polish this buff once well filled  polish add but little after say  small quantity once  two or three plates the polish  well   buffs must  kept perfectly dry the second buff should always    best order  if this   case but little polish after  first need  used much depends upon  last finish   surface   plate    fine impression  desired   same ratio  operator must exercise care  skill  this operation some buff  smaller plates   hands  resting them   fingers  such  manner   buff cannot touch them some  holding  edges  thumb  little finger   remaining fingers under or   back  others buff   holder when this last method  adopted  requires  greatest caution  prevent  dust  getting   buff the holder should  wiped clean the plate frequently slips off or around   buff comes  contact   bed   holder when however  operator  so unfortunate   meet  this mishap  utmost care must  observed  thoroughly cleaning  buff cover before further buffing in this last buffing  may  continued  before except without  application  polish powder   last buff examine  surface occasionally  buff more lightly towards  close   operation using  last  mere weight   buff this last buffing should occupy  long  time   first the point   aimed  is  production   surface  such exquisite polish    itself invisible like  surface   mirror the secret  producing pictures discernible  any light lies  this  more dark deep  mirrorlike  surface   plate  more nearly do we approach  perfection in all cases very light  long continued buffing  productive   greater success since   means  more perfect polish can  obtained the question  often asked why     plates receive  coating so unevenly i  answer  saying   may arise  two causes  first  most general cause   those parts   plate’s surface which  receive  heaviest coating have been more thoroughly polished   consequence     more sensitive   chemical operation second  might perhaps  considered  part   first  heat   plate may not  equal  all  parts this may arise   heat caused   friction  buffing it   well known fact  which every observing practitioner  familiar   silver plate   temperature   deg or less exposed   vapors  iodine  less sensitive  takes  longer time  coat than when     temperature   deg or more whenever  view    taken or any impression which requires  plate   turned   side  should  buffed   other direction so   marks  always  horizontal when  picture   position with  finest possible polish  plate  ready   coating box the question  often asked  operators what   state   plate when polished  allowed  stand   time before using to meet this point we hare only  consider  silver   power acting upon it pure atmosphere does not act upon silver but we do not have this about  our operating rooms    more or less charged  sulphurated hydrogen which soon tarnishes  surface   plate   film  brown sulphurate it  this  sometimes causes  specks which appear  finishing  impression    great annoyance hence we see   plate should  buffed just before receiving  vapor  iodine mr hunt gives his opinion   use  diluted nitric acid   best solution  freeing  surface   plate  says “numerous experiments  plated copper pure silver plates   silvered glass  paper have convinced me   first operation  polishing  nitric acid etc  essential   production   most sensitive surface all who  take  trouble  examine  subject  soon  convinced   acid softens  silver bringing    state  which   extremely susceptible  being either oxydized or iodized according   circumstances may occur   exposure   atmosphere or  iodine” i cannot see  objection  this solution not however  general use our operators do not find   sufficient importance   success  their pictures  accept it  alcoholic solution being   nature less objectionable i  say here   plate submitted  only  ordinary polish  found  contain numberless minute particles   powder made use of should  same plate  buffed   long time  polish  nearly all disappear leaving  cavities   surface free   action  agents employed  subsequent operation for this reason i find  great amount  polishing powder should not  applied   last buff    obvious  three buffs can  employed  adventure  two last should not receive any polishing materials i have examined  plate   considered  possess  fine finish  similar had produced good impressions these same plates when subjected   long  light buffing would present  surface no finer  appearance   naked eye but upon exposure   solar radiation would produce  welldefined image  one fourth less time than  plate without  extra buffing coating  plate—for this purpose our mechanics  artists have provided  simple apparatus called  coatingbox which  so arranged    perfectly tight retaining  vapor   iodine or accelerators    same time allowing  means   slide  exposure   plate  these vapors they can readily  obtained  application  any dealer all  whom can furnish them the principal difficulty  coating  plate    preserving  exact proportion between  quantity  iodine  bromine or quick it  here necessary  say  hardly any two persons see alike  same degree  color so    enabled  judge correctly  exact tint i e what one might describe  light rose red might appear  another  bright or cherry red consequently  only rule   student  daguerreotype   study what appears  him    particular tint or shade required  aid him  produce  desired result practise  proved  but  slight variation   chemical coating   daguerreotype plate  very materially affect  final result the operator  proportion  coating  iodine  bromine or accelerators according   strength  composition   latter experience proves   common impressions iodized   rather light yellow gold tint  brought   bromine   very light rose color have their whites very intense  their deep shades very black it  also known  if you employ  thicker coating  iodine  apply upon   proportionate tint  bromine so   obtain  deep rose tint delineations   less marked   image have  softer tone this effect  been obvious  everyone who  practised  art thus i may observe   light coatings produce strong contrast  light  shade   this contrast grows gradually less until   very heavy coating  almost wholly disappears from this   readily  perceived   middle shades   ones   desired  representing  harmonious blending   lights  shades then if we examine  respect  strength or depth  tone  sharpness  impression we see   light coating produces  very sharp but shallow impression while  other extreme gives  deep but very dull one here then  still better reasons  avoiding either extreme the changes through which  plate passes  coating may  considered  yellow straw color or dark orange yellow  rose color more or less dark  tint or red violet steel blue or indigo  lastly green after attaining this latter color  plate resumes  light yellow tint  continues  pass successively  second time  very few exceptions through all  shades above mentioned i  here present some excellent remarks upon this subject  mr finley this gentleman says “it  well known  all who have given much attention   subject   excess  iodine gives  light portions  objects  peculiar strength  clearness while  darker parts  retarded   were  not brought out   length  exposure which suffices   former hence statuary monuments  all objects  like character  remarkably well delineated   original process  daguerre  plate being coated  iodine alone an excess  bromine   certain degree   opposite effect  white portions   impression appearing   dull leaden hue while those which should  black or dark appear quite light this being  case i conclude there must   point between  two extremes where light  dark objects    photogenic equilibrium the great object therefore   maintain  nearly  possible  perfect balance between  two elements entering into union  form  sensitive coating   plate  order   lights  shades  truly  faithfully represented   all objects whether light or dark  made  appear so far conformable  nature   consistent   difference   photogenic energy   different colored rays  light it  this nicelybalanced combination which ensures   highest degree  union   essential qualities   fine daguerreotype viz clearness  strength  softness  purity  tone “so far  i know    universal practice  operators  judge   proportion  iodine  bromine  coating  plate  two standards  color  one fixed upon   iodine  other   additional coating  bromine now i maintain  these alone form  very fallacious standard first because  color appears   eye either lighter or darker according  there  more or less light  which we inspect  coating  secondly because if  occur  we  deceived  obtaining  exact tint   first coating we  worse misled  obtaining  second  if  iodine coating  too light then  undue proportion  bromine  used  order  bring    second standard  vice versa” the iodine box should  kept clean  dry the plate immediately after  last buffing should  placed over  iodine   coating  depend upon  character   tone   impression desired coating over dry iodine   orange color then over  accelerator   light rose  back over iodine one sixth  long  first coating  produce  fine soft tone    coating generally used  most accelerators the plate iodized   dark orange yellow or tinged slightly  incipient rose color coated over  accelerator   deep rose red then back over iodine onetenth  long   first coating gives  clear strong bold deep impression i  here state  singular fact which  not generally known   operator if  plate coated over  iodine   rose red  then exposed  strong dry quick or weak bromine water so   change  color can  seen then recoated over  iodine twice  long   first coating    found far more sensitive when exposed   light than when   been recoated over  iodine onefourth   time   first coating probably  best accelerating combination   american compound formerly known  “gurney’s american compound” or some   combinations  bromide  lime the first  thought  possess perhaps more uniformity   action than any other combination i have ever used the plate once coated should  kept excluded   light  means   plate holder   camera box i  notice one   principal causes having  tendency  prevent  perfect uniformity  chemical action between  iodine  silver hydrogen or  moisture   atmosphere makes  very perceptible barrier this moisture may arise   result   cold   want  friction   buffing   plate which coming  contact   warmer air   writer  this subject says “it  well known   often  bodies when cold  exposed   warmer air  humidity contained  them  condensed it   this effect  we must attribute  difficulty experienced  operating  most cases” this  corroborated   results experienced  our operators so   seen   plate should    temperature above    atmosphere mr gurney submits his plates   gentle heat   spirit lamp just before exposing them   vapor  iodine experience  convinced me   plate heated  about  deg before being exposed  iodine  present  far better defined image than  plate   temperature   deg i account  this  noticing that   higher temperature  plate throws off any larger crystals  might otherwise  deposited receiving only  finer thus producing  more perfect chemical combination  iodide  silver i would call  attention   operator  this point  presenting something  interest  which may direct   way  accelerating  future operations that  presence   film  moisture over  plate   preventive  uniform chemical action may  readily understood   fact  iodine  almost insoluble  water requiring seven thousand parts  water  dissolve one  iodine or one grain   gallon  water yet  affinities  silver  other substances  so powerful   prevent  existing   insulated state hence we can account   frequent occurrence   plate presenting parts   image over  surface it  quite evident  those parts  plate’s surface covered  moisture  nothing like  sensitive   iodine  those parts perfectly free exposure   plate   camera  position—the time  exposure necessary  produce  image upon  daguerreotype plate can only  determined  experiment  requires  liberality  judgment   exercised   part   operator the constant variation   light renders  impossible  lay down any exact rule upon this point light  not alone   considered  amount  coating exercises  deviating influence also  subjects   represented  not

towards  boiling point  deg  vapors  mercury rise  greater abundance  collect  larger globules  cold surfaces for various reasons i prefer  high temperature  short exposure it accelerates  process it renders  lights   picture more strong  clear while  deep shades  more intense it gives  finer lustre   drapery the solarized portions also  very seldom blue especially after gilding if heated too high however  light parts become   dead chalky white   shadows  injured  numerous little globules  mercury deposited over them just  right quantity  mercury leaves  impression   transparent pearly white

professors upon  subject   position   plates while exposed   mercurial vapour mr hunt  referring  this subject says “daguerre himself laid much stress upon  necessity  exposing  plate   mercury   angle  about  deg this perhaps   most convenient position   enables  operator  view  plate distinctly  watch  development   design but beyond this i am satisfied there exists no real necessity  angular position both horizontally  vertically i have often produced equally effective daguerreotypes” i presume   last sentence  mr hunt    confined his experiments   smaller sized plates hence  may not have thought   effect   vertical exposure   large plate in america this   subject  no little importance when  impression    developed upon  plate fifteen  seventeen inches  we  use  angle  about

this preparation    hold  bromine longer than others where starch  not employed as regards this claim we do not think  can  substantiated our experience  practice  led us   conclusion  there  no great difference  respects durability but there  some little difference  regards  tone   impressions produced   use to one quart  hydrate  lime add one quart  finely pulverized starch to this mixture add bromine until  assumes  deep yellow or pink color starch may  added  any   dry mixtures use—coat over  iodine   deep yellow then over this quick   red color recoat about one sixth   time  first

iodine  accelerator  not answer for example if  plate exposed   vapor  iodine  perfectly coated  sixteen seconds  then exposed   accelerator not having iodine   combination receives  coating  four seconds    found   proper proportionate coating cannot  preserved  adopting  proportion  time but   contrary  time  diminish  exposure over  accelerator    above example if   desired  coat  plate  twice  much iodine    above example  time would be over iodine thirtytwo seconds  over  accelerator to possess  proper proportion  six  seven seconds hence    many inexperienced operators when wishing  vary their usual manner  coating fail  producing  favorable result they coat calculating  proportion  time when they should not dry quick no —bromide  lime  magnesia—to one quart  hydrate  lime add one quart  magnesia  mix them well together add bromine same   preparing bromide  lime coat  same  over dry quick no  this combination produces very uniform results   worked  much success  beginners chlorobromide  lime—to  bromide  lime add chloride  bromine until  mixture becomes  pale yellow color resembling sulphur it should  shook well  enough   chloride  bromine added  bring  compound   deep

shall endeavor  give  plain  concise  manner  manipulation  possible for some time    question among  operators generally    beneficial result  electrotyping  daguerreotype plate but   few years past our first operators have found   fact   well electrosilvered surface   best  producing  portrait   daguerreotype from my own experiments i have found   plate  being galvanized can  rendered more

delineated the style  battery best   purpose  been  now is  question  dispute among operators some preferring  daniell battery  smee’s some claim  superiority   first   uniformity  action others   latter   strength i consider either good    inexperienced would prefer  daniell this  more simple   construction while   certainty  action the more skillful electrotyper would prefer smee’s  this   one most generally  use i would remark   plan  galvanizing plates should  followed  every operator  when once thoroughly tested no one  abandon it silvering solution to any desired quantity  chloride

this solution  now ready   platecup enough water may  added  cover any sized plate when held perpendicular   cup the strength   solution may  kept up  occasionally adding  chloride  silver  cyanide  potassium there should alway   very little excess   cyanide the plate should  well cleaned  buffed   solution well stirred before   immersed care should  observed  keep  solution clean  allow no

ready  buffing buff  coat   usual manner some operators    practice  immersing  plate   solution  buffing twice this additional silvering  no improvement wherever there  been  proper first coating sometimes  operator  troubled  streaks or scum   plate this may arise  three causes all  which experience must teach  experimenter  avoid first too great  excess  cyanide   solution second  lack  silver third  current too strong another annoyance arises   solution being dirty   dirt collecting   surface when this   case  dirt  sure  come  contact   surface   plate    plunged into  solution   result   scum    difficult  dispose of this can  prevented only  frequent filtering one thing should always  borne  mind  electrotyping daguerreotype plates—that  order  secure  perfectly coated
