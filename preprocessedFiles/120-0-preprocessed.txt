squire trelawney dr livesey   rest  these gentlemen having asked me  write down  whole particulars about treasure island   beginning   end keeping nothing back but  bearings   island   only because there  still treasure not yet lifted i take up my pen   year  grace   go back   time when my father kept  admiral benbow inn   brown old seaman   sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof i remember him  if   yesterday   came plodding   inn door his seachest following behind him   handbarrowa tall strong heavy nutbrown man his tarry pigtail falling over  shoulder  his soiled blue coat his hands ragged  scarred  black broken nails   sabre cut across one cheek  dirty livid white i remember him looking round  cove  whistling  himself   did so  then breaking out   old seasong   sang so often afterwards “fifteen men   dead man’s chest yohoho   bottle  rum”   high old tottering voice  seemed  have been tuned  broken   capstan bars then  rapped   door   bit  stick like  handspike   carried  when my father appeared called roughly   glass  rum this when   brought  him  drank slowly like  connoisseur lingering   taste  still looking about him   cliffs  up  our signboard “this   handy cove” says   length “and  pleasant sittyated grogshop much company mate” my father told him no very little company  more   pity “well then” said he “this   berth  me here you matey”  cried   man who trundled  barrow “bring up alongside  help up my chest i’ll stay here  bit”  continued “i’m  plain man rum  bacon  eggs  what i want   head up there   watch ships off what you mought call me you mought call me captain oh i see what you’re atthere”   threw down three or four gold pieces   threshold “you can tell me when i’ve worked through that” says he looking  fierce   commander and indeed bad  his clothes   coarsely   spoke  had none   appearance   man who sailed before  mast but seemed like  mate or skipper accustomed   obeyed or  strike the man who came   barrow told us  mail had set him down  morning before   royal george   had inquired what inns there  along  coast  hearing ours well spoken of i suppose  described  lonely had chosen    others  his place  residence and   all we could learn  our guest he   very silent man  custom all day  hung round  cove or upon  cliffs   brass telescope all evening  sat   corner   parlour next  fire  drank rum  water very strong mostly  would not speak when spoken to only look up sudden  fierce  blow through his nose like  foghorn  we   people who came about our house soon learned  let him be every day when  came back  his stroll  would ask if any seafaring men had gone  along  road at first we thought    want  company  his own kind  made him ask this question but  last we began  see   desirous  avoid them when  seaman did put up   admiral benbow as now  then some did making   coast road  bristol  would look   him through  curtained door before  entered  parlour    always sure    silent   mouse when any such  present for me  least there  no secret about  matter  i was   way  sharer  his alarms he had taken me aside one day  promised me  silver fourpenny   first  every month if i would only keep my “weathereye open   seafaring man  one leg”  let him know  moment  appeared often enough when  first   month came round  i applied  him  my wage  would only blow through his nose  me  stare me down but before  week  out   sure  think better  it bring me my fourpenny piece  repeat his orders  look out  “the seafaring man  one leg” how  personage haunted my dreams i need scarcely tell you on stormy nights when  wind shook  four corners   house   surf roared along  cove  up  cliffs i would see him   thousand forms    thousand diabolical expressions now  leg would  cut off   knee now   hip now    monstrous kind   creature who had never had but  one leg     middle  his body to see him leap  run  pursue me over hedge  ditch   worst  nightmares and altogether i paid pretty dear  my monthly fourpenny piece   shape  these abominable fancies but though i  so terrified   idea   seafaring man  one leg i  far less afraid   captain himself than anybody else who knew him there  nights when  took  deal more rum  water than his head would carry  then  would sometimes sit  sing his wicked old wild seasongs minding nobody but sometimes  would call  glasses round  force all  trembling company  listen  his stories or bear  chorus  his singing often i have heard  house shaking  “yohoho   bottle  rum” all  neighbours joining   dear life   fear  death upon them  each singing louder than  other  avoid remark for  these fits    most overriding companion ever known  would slap his hand   table  silence all round  would fly up   passion  anger   question or sometimes because none  put  so  judged  company  not following his story nor would  allow anyone  leave  inn till  had drunk himself sleepy  reeled off  bed his stories  what frightened people worst  all dreadful stories they wereabout hanging  walking  plank  storms  sea   dry tortugas  wild deeds  places   spanish main by his own account  must have lived his life among some   wickedest men  god ever allowed upon  sea   language  which  told these stories shocked our plain country people almost  much   crimes   described my father  always saying  inn would  ruined  people would soon cease coming there   tyrannized over  put down  sent shivering  their beds but i really believe his presence did us good people  frightened   time but  looking back they rather liked it    fine excitement   quiet country life  there  even  party   younger men who pretended  admire him calling him  “true seadog”   “real old salt”  such like names  saying there   sort  man  made england terrible  sea in one way indeed  bade fair  ruin us   kept  staying week after week   last month after month so  all  money had been long exhausted  still my father never plucked up  heart  insist  having more if ever  mentioned it  captain blew through his nose so loudly  you might say  roared  stared my poor father out   room i have seen him wringing his hands after such  rebuff  i am sure  annoyance   terror  lived  must have greatly hastened his early  unhappy death all  time  lived  us  captain made no change whatever  his dress but  buy some stockings   hawker one   cocks  his hat having fallen down  let  hang   day forth though    great annoyance when  blew i remember  appearance  his coat which  patched himself upstairs  his room  which before  end  nothing but patches he never wrote or received  letter   never spoke  any but  neighbours   these   most part only when drunk  rum the great seachest none  us had ever seen open he  only once crossed    towards  end when my poor father  far gone   decline  took him off dr livesey came late one afternoon  see  patient took  bit  dinner  my mother  went into  parlour  smoke  pipe until his horse should come down   hamlet  we had no stabling   old benbow i followed him in  i remember observing  contrast  neat bright doctor  his powder  white  snow  his bright black eyes  pleasant manners made   coltish country folk  above all   filthy heavy bleared scarecrow   pirate  ours sitting far gone  rum  his arms   table suddenly hethe captain  isbegan  pipe up his eternal song “fifteen men   dead man’s chest yohoho   bottle  rum drink   devil had done   rest yohoho   bottle  rum” at first i had supposed “the dead man’s chest”    identical big box  his upstairs   front room   thought had been mingled  my nightmares     onelegged seafaring man but  this time we had all long ceased  pay any particular notice   song   new  night  nobody but dr livesey   him i observed  did not produce  agreeable effect   looked up   moment quite angrily before  went   his talk  old taylor  gardener   new cure   rheumatics in  meantime  captain gradually brightened up  his own music   last flapped his hand upon  table before him   way we all knew  mean silence the voices stopped  once all but dr livesey’s  went   before speaking clear  kind  drawing briskly  his pipe between every word or two the captain glared  him   while flapped his hand again glared still harder   last broke out   villainous low oath “silence there between decks” “were you addressing me sir” says  doctor  when  ruffian had told him  another oath  this  so “i have only one thing  say  you sir” replies  doctor “that if you keep  drinking rum  world  soon  quit   very dirty scoundrel” the old fellow’s fury  awful he sprang  his feet drew  opened  sailor’s claspknife  balancing  open   palm  his hand threatened  pin  doctor   wall the doctor never so much  moved he spoke  him  before over his shoulder    same tone  voice rather high so  all  room might hear but perfectly calm  steady “if you do not put  knife this instant  your pocket i promise upon my honour you shall hang   next assizes” then followed  battle  looks between them but  captain soon knuckled under put up his weapon  resumed his seat grumbling like  beaten dog “and now sir” continued  doctor “since i now know there’s such  fellow  my district you may count i’ll have  eye upon you day  night i’m not  doctor only i’m  magistrate  if i catch  breath  complaint against you if it’s only   piece  incivility like tonight’s i’ll take effectual means  have you hunted down  routed out  this let  suffice” soon after dr livesey’s horse came   door   rode away but  captain held his peace  evening   many evenings  come  black dog appears  disappears it  not very long after this  there occurred  first   mysterious events  rid us  last   captain though not  you  see  his affairs it   bitter cold winter  long hard frosts  heavy gales    plain   first  my poor father  little likely  see  spring he sank daily  my mother  i had all  inn upon our hands   kept busy enough without paying much regard  our unpleasant guest it  one january morning very earlya pinching frosty morningthe cove all grey  hoarfrost  ripple lapping softly   stones  sun still low  only touching  hilltops  shining far  seaward the captain had risen earlier than usual  set out down  beach his cutlass swinging under  broad skirts   old blue coat his brass telescope under his arm his hat tilted back upon his head i remember his breath hanging like smoke  his wake   strode off   last sound i heard  him   turned  big rock   loud snort  indignation  though his mind  still running upon dr livesey well mother  upstairs  father  i  laying  breakfasttable against  captain’s return when  parlour door opened   man stepped   whom i had never set my eyes before he   pale tallowy creature wanting two fingers   left hand  though  wore  cutlass  did not look much like  fighter i had always my eye open  seafaring men  one leg or two  i remember this one puzzled me he  not sailorly  yet  had  smack   sea about him too i asked him what   his service   said  would take rum but  i  going out   room  fetch it  sat down upon  table  motioned me  draw near i paused where i was  my napkin  my hand “come here sonny” says he “come nearer here” i took  step nearer “is this here table  my mate bill”  asked   kind  leer i told him i did not know his mate bill  this    person who stayed  our house whom we called  captain “well” said he “my mate bill would  called  captain  like  not he   cut  one cheek   mighty pleasant way  him particularly  drink  my mate bill we’ll put it  argument like  your captain   cut  one cheekand we’ll put it if you like   cheek’s  right one ah well i told you now  my mate bill  this here house” i told him   out walking “which way sonny which way   gone” and when i had pointed out  rock  told him how  captain  likely  return  how soon  answered  few other questions “ah” said he “this’ll   good  drink  my mate bill” the expression  his face   said these words  not  all pleasant  i had my own reasons  thinking   stranger  mistaken even supposing  meant what  said but   no affair  mine i thought  besides   difficult  know what  do the stranger kept hanging about just inside  inn door peering round  corner like  cat waiting   mouse once i stepped out myself into  road but  immediately called me back   i did not obey quick enough  his fancy  most horrible change came over his tallowy face   ordered me    oath  made me jump as soon  i  back again  returned  his former manner half fawning half sneering patted me   shoulder told me i   good boy   had taken quite  fancy  me “i have  son  my own” said he “as like you  two blocks  he’s all  pride  my ’art but  great thing  boys  discipline sonnydiscipline now if you had sailed along  bill you wouldn’t have stood there   spoke  twicenot you that  never bill’s way nor  way  sich  sailed  him and here sure enough  my mate bill   spyglass under his arm bless his old ’art   sure you  me’ll just go back into  parlour sonny  get behind  door  we’ll give bill  little surprisebless his ’art i say again” so saying  stranger backed along  me into  parlour  put me behind him   corner so  we  both hidden   open door i  very uneasy  alarmed  you may fancy   rather added  my fears  observe   stranger  certainly frightened himself he cleared  hilt  his cutlass  loosened  blade   sheath  all  time we  waiting there  kept swallowing  if  felt what we used  call  lump   throat at last  strode  captain slammed  door behind him without looking   right or left  marched straight across  room  where his breakfast awaited him “bill” said  stranger   voice  i thought  had tried  make bold  big the captain spun round  his heel  fronted us all  brown had gone out  his face  even his nose  blue  had  look   man who sees  ghost or  evil one or something worse if anything can be  upon my word i felt sorry  see him all   moment turn so old  sick “come bill you know me you know  old shipmate bill surely” said  stranger the captain made  sort  gasp “black dog” said he “and who else” returned  other getting more  his ease “black dog  ever was come   see his old shipmate billy   admiral benbow inn ah bill bill we have seen  sight  times us two since i lost them two talons” holding up his mutilated hand “now look here” said  captain “you’ve run me down here i am well then speak up what  it” “that’s you bill” returned black dog “you’re   right  it billy i’ll have  glass  rum  this dear child here  i’ve took such  liking to  we’ll sit down if you please  talk square like old shipmates” when i returned   rum they  already seated  either side   captain’s breakfasttableblack dog next   door  sitting sideways so   have one eye  his old shipmate  one  i thought  his retreat he bade me go  leave  door wide open “none  your keyholes  me sonny”  said  i left them together  retired into  bar for  long time though i certainly did my best  listen i could hear nothing but  low gattling but  last  voices began  grow higher  i could pick up  word or two mostly oaths   captain “no no no no   end  it”  cried once and again “if  comes  swinging swing all say i” then all   sudden there   tremendous explosion  oaths  other noisesthe chair  table went over   lump  clash  steel followed  then  cry  pain   next instant i saw black dog  full flight   captain hotly pursuing both  drawn cutlasses   former streaming blood   left shoulder just   door  captain aimed   fugitive one last tremendous cut which would certainly have split him   chine had  not been intercepted  our big signboard  admiral benbow you may see  notch   lower side   frame  this day that blow   last   battle once out upon  road black dog  spite  his wound showed  wonderful clean pair  heels  disappeared over  edge   hill  half  minute the captain  his part stood staring   signboard like  bewildered man then  passed his hand over his eyes several times   last turned back into  house “jim” says he “rum”    spoke  reeled  little  caught himself  one hand against  wall “are you hurt” cried i “rum”  repeated “i must get away  here rum rum” i ran  fetch it but i  quite unsteadied  all  had fallen out  i broke one glass  fouled  tap  while i  still getting  my own way i heard  loud fall   parlour  running in beheld  captain lying full length upon  floor at  same instant my mother alarmed   cries  fighting came running downstairs  help me between us we raised his head he  breathing very loud  hard but his eyes  closed  his face  horrible colour “dear deary me” cried my mother “what  disgrace upon  house and your poor father sick” in  meantime we had no idea what  do  help  captain nor any other thought but   had got his deathhurt   scuffle   stranger i got  rum   sure  tried  put  down his throat but his teeth  tightly shut  his jaws  strong  iron it   happy relief  us when  door opened  doctor livesey came in  his visit  my father “oh doctor” we cried “what shall we do where   wounded” “wounded a fiddlestick’s end” said  doctor “no more wounded than you or i the man  had  stroke  i warned him now mrs hawkins just you run upstairs  your husband  tell him if possible nothing about it for my part i must do my best  save this fellow’s trebly worthless life jim you get me  basin” when i got back   basin  doctor had already ripped up  captain’s sleeve  exposed his great sinewy arm it  tattooed  several places “here’s luck” “a fair wind”  “billy bones his fancy”  very neatly  clearly executed   forearm  up near  shoulder there   sketch   gallows   man hanging  itdone  i thought  great spirit “prophetic” said  doctor touching this picture  his finger “and now master billy bones if   your name we’ll have  look   colour  your blood jim”  said “are you afraid  blood” “no sir” said i “well then” said he “you hold  basin”     took his lancet  opened  vein a great deal  blood  taken before  captain opened his eyes  looked mistily about him first  recognized  doctor   unmistakable frown then his glance fell upon me   looked relieved but suddenly his colour changed   tried  raise himself crying “where’s black dog” “there  no black dog here” said  doctor “except what you have  your own back you have been drinking rum you have had  stroke precisely  i told you  i have just very much against my own will dragged you headforemost out   grave now mr bones” “that’s not my name”  interrupted “much i care” returned  doctor “it’s  name   buccaneer  my acquaintance  i call you     sake  shortness  what i have  say  you  this one glass  rum won’t kill you but if you take one you’ll take another  another  i stake my wig if you don’t break off short you’ll diedo you understand thatdie  go  your own place like  man   bible come now make  effort i’ll help you  your bed  once” between us  much trouble we managed  hoist him upstairs  laid him  his bed where his head fell back   pillow  if   almost fainting “now mind you” said  doctor “i clear my consciencethe name  rum  you  death” and    went off  see my father taking me  him   arm “this  nothing”  said  soon   had closed  door “i have drawn blood enough  keep him quiet awhile  should lie   week where  isthat   best thing  him  you but another stroke would settle him”  the black spot about noon i stopped   captain’s door  some cooling drinks  medicines he  lying very much  we had left him only  little higher   seemed both weak  excited “jim”  said “you’re  only one here that’s worth anything  you know i’ve been always good  you never  month but i’ve given you  silver fourpenny  yourself and now you see mate i’m pretty low  deserted  all  jim you’ll bring me one noggin  rum now won’t you matey” “the doctor” i began but  broke  cursing  doctor   feeble voice but heartily “doctors  all swabs”  said “and  doctor there why what do  know about seafaring men i been  places hot  pitch  mates dropping round  yellow jack   blessed land aheaving like  sea  earthquakeswhat   doctor know  lands like thatand i lived  rum i tell you it’s been meat  drink  man  wife  me  if i’m not  have my rum now i’m  poor old hulk   lee shore my blood’ll   you jim   doctor swab”   ran  again   while  curses “look jim how my fingers fidges”  continued   pleading tone “i can’t keep ’em still not i i haven’t had  drop this blessed day that doctor’s  fool i tell you if i don’t have  dram o’ rum jim i’ll have  horrors i seen some  ’em already i seen old flint   corner there behind you  plain  print i seen him  if i get  horrors i’m  man   lived rough  i’ll raise cain your doctor hisself said one glass wouldn’t hurt me i’ll give you  golden guinea   noggin jim” he  growing more  more excited  this alarmed me  my father who  very low  day  needed quiet besides i  reassured   doctor’s words now quoted  me  rather offended   offer   bribe “i want none  your money” said i “but what you owe my father i’ll get you one glass  no more” when i brought   him  seized  greedily  drank  out “aye aye” said he “that’s some better sure enough and now matey did  doctor say how long i   lie here  this old berth” “a week  least” said i “thunder”  cried “a week i can’t do that they’d have  black spot  me  then the lubbers  going about  get  wind  me this blessed moment lubbers  couldn’t keep what they got  want  nail what  another’s is  seamanly behaviour now i want  know but i’m  saving soul i never wasted good money  mine nor lost  neither  i’ll trick ’em again i’m not afraid  ’em i’ll shake out another reef matey  daddle ’em again” as   thus speaking  had risen  bed  great difficulty holding  my shoulder   grip  almost made me cry out  moving his legs like so much dead weight his words spirited  they   meaning contrasted sadly   weakness   voice  which they  uttered he paused when  had got into  sitting position   edge “that doctor’s done me”  murmured “my ears  singing lay me back” before i could do much  help him  had fallen back again  his former place where  lay   while silent “jim”  said  length “you saw  seafaring man today” “black dog” i asked “ah black dog” says he “he’s  bad un but there’s worse  put him on now if i can’t get away nohow  they tip me  black spot mind you it’s my old seachest they’re after you get   horseyou can can’t you well then you get   horse  go towell yes i willto  eternal doctor swab  tell him  pipe all handsmagistrates  sichand he’ll lay ’em aboard   admiral benbowall old flint’s crew man  boy all  ’em that’s left i  first mate i was old flint’s first mate  i’m  on’y one  knows  place he gave  me  savannah when  lay adying like  if i   now you see but you won’t peach unless they get  black spot  me or unless you see  black dog again or  seafaring man  one leg jimhim above all” “but what   black spot captain” i asked “that’s  summons mate i’ll tell you if they get that but you keep your weathereye open jim  i’ll share  you equals upon my honour” he wandered  little longer his voice growing weaker but soon after i had given him his medicine which  took like  child   remark “if ever  seaman wanted drugs it’s me”  fell  last into  heavy swoonlike sleep  which i left him what i should have done had all gone well i do not know probably i should have told  whole story   doctor  i   mortal fear lest  captain should repent  his confessions  make  end  me but  things fell out my poor father died quite suddenly  evening which put all other matters  one side our natural distress  visits   neighbours  arranging   funeral  all  work   inn   carried    meanwhile kept me so busy  i had scarcely time  think   captain far less   afraid  him he got downstairs next morning   sure  had his meals  usual though  ate little  had more i am afraid than his usual supply  rum   helped himself out   bar scowling  blowing through his nose  no one dared  cross him on  night before  funeral    drunk  ever    shocking   house  mourning  hear him singing away  his ugly old seasong but weak   was we  all   fear  death  him   doctor  suddenly taken up   case many miles away   never near  house after my father’s death i have said  captain  weak  indeed  seemed rather  grow weaker than regain his strength he clambered up  down stairs  went   parlour   bar  back again  sometimes put his nose out  doors  smell  sea holding    walls   went  support  breathing hard  fast like  man   steep mountain he never particularly addressed me    my belief  had  good  forgotten his confidences but his temper  more flighty  allowing  his bodily weakness more violent than ever he had  alarming way now when   drunk  drawing his cutlass  laying  bare before him   table but  all that  minded people less  seemed shut up  his own thoughts  rather wandering once  instance  our extreme wonder  piped up   different air  kind  country lovesong   must have learned  his youth before  had begun  follow  sea so things passed until  day after  funeral  about three o’clock   bitter foggy frosty afternoon i  standing   door   moment full  sad thoughts about my father when i saw someone drawing slowly near along  road he  plainly blind   tapped before him   stick  wore  great green shade over his eyes  nose    hunched  if  age or weakness  wore  huge old tattered seacloak   hood  made him appear positively deformed i never saw  my life  more dreadfullooking figure he stopped  little   inn  raising his voice   odd singsong addressed  air  front  him “will any kind friend inform  poor blind man who  lost  precious sight  his eyes   gracious defence  his native country englandand god bless king georgewhere or  what part  this country  may now be” “you    admiral benbow black hill cove my good man” said i “i hear  voice” said he “a young voice will you give me your hand my kind young friend  lead me in” i held out my hand   horrible softspoken eyeless creature gripped    moment like  vise i  so much startled  i struggled  withdraw but  blind man pulled me close up  him   single action  his arm “now boy”  said “take me    captain” “sir” said i “upon my word i dare not” “oh”  sneered “that’s it take me  straight or i’ll break your arm” and  gave it   spoke  wrench  made me cry out “sir” said i “it   yourself i mean the captain  not what  used  be he sits   drawn cutlass another gentleman” “come now march” interrupted he  i never heard  voice so cruel  cold  ugly   blind man’s it cowed me more than  pain  i began  obey him  once walking straight    door  towards  parlour where our sick old buccaneer  sitting dazed  rum the blind man clung close  me holding me  one iron fist  leaning almost more  his weight  me than i could carry “lead me straight up  him  when i’m  view cry out ‘here’s  friend  you bill’ if you don’t i’ll do this”     gave me  twitch  i thought would have made me faint between this  that i  so utterly terrified   blind beggar  i forgot my terror   captain   i opened  parlour door cried out  words  had ordered   trembling voice the poor captain raised his eyes   one look  rum went out  him  left him staring sober the expression  his face  not so much  terror   mortal sickness he made  movement  rise but i do not believe  had enough force left  his body “now bill sit where you are” said  beggar “if i can’t see i can hear  finger stirring business  business hold out your left hand boy take his left hand   wrist  bring  near  my right” we both obeyed him   letter  i saw him pass something   hollow   hand  held his stick into  palm   captain’s which closed upon  instantly “and now that’s done” said  blind man    words  suddenly left hold  me   incredible accuracy  nimbleness skipped out   parlour  into  road where  i still stood motionless i could hear his stick go taptaptapping into  distance it  some time before either i or  captain seemed  gather our senses but  length  about   same moment i released his wrist which i  still holding   drew  his hand  looked sharply into  palm “ten o’clock”  cried “six hours we’ll do them yet”   sprang  his feet even   did so  reeled put his hand  his throat stood swaying   moment  then   peculiar sound fell  his whole height face foremost   floor i ran  him  once calling  my mother but haste  all  vain the captain had been struck dead  thundering apoplexy it   curious thing  understand  i had certainly never liked  man though  late i had begun  pity him but  soon  i saw    dead i burst into  flood  tears it   second death i had known   sorrow   first  still fresh  my heart  the seachest i lost no time  course  telling my mother all  i knew  perhaps should have told her long before  we saw ourselves  once   difficult  dangerous position some   man’s moneyif  had anywas certainly due  us but   not likely  our captain’s shipmates above all  two specimens seen  me black dog   blind beggar would  inclined  give up their booty  payment   dead man’s debts the captain’s order  mount  once  ride  doctor livesey would have left my mother alone  unprotected which  not   thought of indeed  seemed impossible  either  us  remain much longer   house  fall  coals   kitchen grate  very ticking   clock filled us  alarms the neighbourhood  our ears seemed haunted  approaching footsteps  what between  dead body   captain   parlour floor   thought   detestable blind beggar hovering near  hand  ready  return there  moments when   saying goes i jumped  my skin  terror something must speedily  resolved upon   occurred  us  last  go forth together  seek help   neighbouring hamlet no sooner said than done bareheaded  we were we ran out  once   gathering evening   frosty fog the hamlet lay not many hundred yards away though out  view   other side   next cove  what greatly encouraged me     opposite direction   whence  blind man had made his appearance  whither  had presumably returned we  not many minutes   road though we sometimes stopped  lay hold  each other  hearken but there  no unusual soundnothing but  low wash   ripple   croaking   inmates   wood it  already candlelight when we reached  hamlet  i shall never forget how much i  cheered  see  yellow shine  doors  windows but that   proved   best   help we  likely  get   quarter foryou would have thought men would have been ashamed  themselvesno soul would consent  return  us   admiral benbow the more we told  our troubles  moreman woman  childthey clung   shelter  their houses the name  captain flint though   strange  me  well enough known  some there  carried  great weight  terror some   men who had been  fieldwork   far side   admiral benbow remembered besides  have seen several strangers   road  taking them   smugglers  have bolted away  one  least had seen  little lugger  what we called kitt’s hole for  matter anyone who   comrade   captain’s  enough  frighten them  death and  short   long   matter was  while we could get several who  willing enough  ride  dr livesey’s which lay  another direction not one would help us  defend  inn they say cowardice  infectious but then argument is   other hand  great emboldener  so when each had said his say my mother made them  speech she would not she declared lose money  belonged  her fatherless boy “if none   rest  you dare” she said “jim  i dare back we  go  way we came  small thanks  you big hulking chickenhearted men we’ll have  chest open if we die  it and i’ll thank you   bag mrs crossley  bring back our lawful money in” of course i said i would go  my mother   course they all cried out  our foolhardiness but even then not  man would go along  us all they would do   give me  loaded pistol lest we  attacked   promise  have horses ready saddled  case we  pursued  our return while one lad   ride forward   doctor’s  search  armed assistance my heart  beating finely when we two set forth   cold night upon this dangerous venture a full moon  beginning  rise  peered redly through  upper edges   fog  this increased our haste    plain before we came forth again  all would   bright  day  our departure exposed   eyes  any watchers we slipped along  hedges noiseless  swift nor did we see or hear anything  increase our terrors till  our relief  door   admiral benbow had closed behind us i slipped  bolt  once  we stood  panted   moment   dark alone   house   dead captain’s body then my mother got  candle   bar  holding each other’s hands we advanced into  parlour he lay  we had left him  his back  his eyes open  one arm stretched out “draw down  blind jim” whispered my mother “they might come  watch outside and now” said she when i had done so “we have  get  key off that  who’s  touch it i should like  know”  she gave  kind  sob  she said  words i went down  my knees  once on  floor close  his hand there   little round  paper blackened   one side i could not doubt  this   black spot  taking  up i found written   other side   very good clear hand this short message “you have till ten tonight” “he had till ten mother” said i  just  i said it our old clock began striking this sudden noise startled us shockingly but  news  good    only six “now jim” she said “that key” i felt  his pockets one after another a few small coins  thimble  some thread  big needles  piece  pigtail tobacco bitten away   end his gully   crooked handle  pocket compass   tinder box  all  they contained  i began  despair “perhaps it’s round his neck” suggested my mother overcoming  strong repugnance i tore open his shirt   neck  there sure enough hanging   bit  tarry string which i cut  his own gully we found  key at this triumph we  filled  hope  hurried upstairs without delay   little room where  had slept so long  where his box had stood since  day  his arrival it  like any other seaman’s chest   outside  initial “b” burned   top     hot iron   corners somewhat smashed  broken   long rough usage “give me  key” said my mother  though  lock  very stiff she had turned   thrown back  lid   twinkling a strong smell  tobacco  tar rose   interior but nothing    seen   top except  suit  very good clothes carefully brushed  folded they had never been worn my mother said under that  miscellany begana quadrant  tin canikin several sticks  tobacco two brace  very handsome pistols  piece  bar silver  old spanish watch  some other trinkets  little value  mostly  foreign make  pair  compasses mounted  brass  five or six curious west indian shells i have often wondered since why  should have carried about these shells  him  his wandering guilty  hunted life in  meantime we had found nothing  any value but  silver   trinkets  neither  these   our way underneath there   old boatcloak whitened  seasalt  many  harbourbar my mother pulled  up  impatience  there lay before us  last things   chest  bundle tied up  oilcloth  looking like papers   canvas bag  gave forth   touch  jingle  gold “i’ll show these rogues  i’m  honest woman” said my mother “i’ll have my dues  not  farthing over hold mrs crossley’s bag” and she began  count over  amount   captain’s score   sailor’s bag into  one  i  holding it   long difficult business   coins   all countries  sizesdoubloons  louis d’ors  guineas  pieces  eight  i know not what besides all shaken together  random the guineas too  about  scarcest     these only  my mother knew how  make her count when we  about halfway through i suddenly put my hand upon her arm  i had heard   silent frosty air  sound  brought my heart into my mouththe taptapping   blind man’s stick upon  frozen road it drew nearer  nearer while we sat holding our breath then  struck sharp   inn door  then we could hear  handle being turned   bolt rattling   wretched being tried  enter  then there   long time  silence both within  without at last  tapping recommenced and  our indescribable joy  gratitude died slowly away again until  ceased   heard “mother” said i “take  whole  let’s  going”  i  sure  bolted door must have seemed suspicious  would bring  whole hornet’s nest about our ears though how thankful i   i had bolted it none could tell who had never met  terrible blind man but my mother frightened  she was would not consent  take  fraction more than  due  her   obstinately unwilling   content  less it  not yet seven she said   long way she knew her rights  she would have them  she  still arguing  me when  little low whistle sounded  good way off upon  hill that  enough  more than enough  both  us “i’ll take what i have” she said jumping  her feet “and i’ll take this  square  count” said i picking up  oilskin packet next moment we  both groping downstairs leaving  candle   empty chest   next we had opened  door    full retreat we had not started  moment too soon the fog  rapidly dispersing already  moon shone quite clear   high ground  either side    only   exact bottom   dell  round  tavern door   thin veil still hung unbroken  conceal  first steps  our escape far less than halfway   hamlet very little beyond  bottom   hill we must come forth into  moonlight nor  this all   sound  several footsteps running came already  our ears   we looked back  their direction  light tossing   fro  still rapidly advancing showed  one   newcomers carried  lantern “my dear” said my mother suddenly “take  money  run on i am going  faint” this  certainly  end  both  us i thought how i cursed  cowardice   neighbours how i blamed my poor mother  her honesty  her greed  her past foolhardiness  present weakness we  just   little bridge  good fortune  i helped her tottering  she was   edge   bank where sure enough she gave  sigh  fell  my shoulder i do not know how i found  strength  do   all  i am afraid   roughly done but i managed  drag her down  bank   little way under  arch farther i could not move her   bridge  too low  let me do more than crawl below it so there we had  staymy mother almost entirely exposed  both  us within earshot   inn  the last   blind man my curiosity   sense  stronger than my fear  i could not remain where i was but crept back   bank again whence sheltering my head behind  bush  broom i might command  road before our door i  scarcely  position ere my enemies began  arrive seven or eight  them running hard their feet beating out  time along  road   man   lantern some paces  front three men ran together hand  hand  i made out even through  mist   middle man  this trio   blind beggar the next moment his voice showed me  i  right “down   door”  cried “aye aye sir” answered two or three   rush  made upon  admiral benbow  lanternbearer following  then i could see them pause  hear speeches passed   lower key  if they  surprised  find  door open but  pause  brief   blind man again issued his commands his voice sounded louder  higher  if   afire  eagerness  rage “in in in”  shouted  cursed them  their delay four or five  them obeyed  once two remaining   road   formidable beggar there   pause then  cry  surprise  then  voice shouting   house “bill’s dead” but  blind man swore  them again  their delay “search him some  you shirking lubbers   rest  you aloft  get  chest”  cried i could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs so   house must have shook  it promptly afterwards fresh sounds  astonishment arose  window   captain’s room  thrown open   slam   jingle  broken glass   man leaned out into  moonlight head  shoulders  addressed  blind beggar   road below him “pew”  cried “they’ve been before us someone’s turned  chest out alow  aloft” “is  there” roared pew “the money’s there” the blind man cursed  money “flint’s fist i mean”  cried “we don’t see  here nohow” returned  man “here you below there    bill” cried  blind man again at  another fellow probably him who had remained below  search  captain’s body came   door   inn “bill’s been overhauled a’ready” said he “nothin’ left” “it’s these people   innit’s  boy i wish i had put his eyes out” cried  blind man pew “there  no time agothey had  door bolted when i tried it scatter lads  find ’em” “sure enough they left their glim here” said  fellow   window “scatter  find ’em rout  house out” reiterated pew striking  his stick upon  road then there followed  great todo through all our old inn heavy feet pounding   fro furniture thrown over doors kicked in until  very rocks reechoed   men came out again one after another   road  declared  we  nowhere   found and just  same whistle  had alarmed my mother  myself over  dead captain’s money  once more clearly audible through  night but this time twice repeated i had thought     blind man’s trumpet so  speak summoning his crew   assault but i now found     signal   hillside towards  hamlet    effect upon  buccaneers  signal  warn them  approaching danger “there’s dirk again” said one “twice we’ll have  budge mates” “budge you skulk” cried pew “dirk   fool   coward   firstyou wouldn’t mind him they must  close by they can’t  far you have your hands  it scatter  look  them dogs oh shiver my soul”  cried “if i had eyes” this appeal seemed  produce some effect  two   fellows began  look here  there among  lumber but halfheartedly i thought   half  eye  their own danger all  time while  rest stood irresolute   road “you have your hands  thousands you fools  you hang  leg you’d   rich  kings if you could find it  you know it’s here  you stand there skulking there wasn’t one  you dared face bill  i did ita blind man and i’m  lose my chance  you i’m    poor crawling beggar sponging  rum when i might  rolling   coach if you had  pluck   weevil   biscuit you would catch them still” “hang it pew we’ve got  doubloons” grumbled one “they might have hid  blessed thing” said another “take  georges pew  don’t stand here squalling” squalling   word  it pew’s anger rose so high  these objections till  last his passion completely taking  upper hand  struck  them right  left  his blindness  his stick sounded heavily  more than one these  their turn cursed back   blind miscreant threatened him  horrid terms  tried  vain  catch  stick  wrest   his grasp this quarrel   saving  us  while   still raging another sound came   top   hill   side   hamletthe tramp  horses galloping almost   same time  pistolshot flash  report came   hedge side and   plainly  last signal  danger   buccaneers turned  once  ran separating  every direction one seaward along  cove one slant across  hill  so on so   half  minute not  sign  them remained but pew him they had deserted whether  sheer panic or out  revenge  his ill words  blows i know not but there  remained behind tapping up  down  road   frenzy  groping  calling  his comrades finally  took  wrong turn  ran  few steps past me towards  hamlet crying “johnny black dog dirk”  other names “you won’t leave old pew matesnot old pew” just then  noise  horses topped  rise  four or five riders came  sight   moonlight  swept  full gallop down  slope at this pew saw his error turned   scream  ran straight   ditch into which  rolled but    his feet again   second  made another dash now utterly bewildered right under  nearest   coming horses the rider tried  save him but  vain down went pew   cry  rang high into  night   four hoofs trampled  spurned him  passed by he fell  his side then gently collapsed upon his face  moved no more i leaped  my feet  hailed  riders they  pulling up  any rate horrified   accident  i soon saw what they were one tailing out behind  rest   lad  had gone   hamlet  dr livesey’s  rest  revenue officers whom  had met   way   whom  had had  intelligence  return  once some news   lugger  kitt’s hole had found  way  supervisor dance  set him forth  night  our direction    circumstance my mother  i owed our preservation  death pew  dead stone dead as  my mother when we had carried her up   hamlet  little cold water  salts   soon brought her back again  she  none  worse  her terror though she still continued  deplore  balance   money in  meantime  supervisor rode on  fast   could  kitt’s hole but his men had  dismount  grope down  dingle leading  sometimes supporting their horses   continual fear  ambushes so   no great matter  surprise  when they got down   hole  lugger  already under way though still close in he hailed her a voice replied telling him  keep out   moonlight or  would get some lead  him    same time  bullet whistled close  his arm soon after  lugger doubled  point  disappeared mr dance stood there   said “like  fish out  water”  all  could do   dispatch  man  b  warn  cutter “and that” said he “is just about  good  nothing they’ve got off clean  there’s  end only”  added “i’m glad i trod  master pew’s corns”   this time  had heard my story i went back  him   admiral benbow  you cannot imagine  house  such  state  smash  very clock had been thrown down  these fellows  their furious hunt after my mother  myself  though nothing had actually been taken away except  captain’s moneybag   little silver   till i could see  once  we  ruined mr dance could make nothing   scene “they got  money you say well then hawkins what  fortune  they after more money i suppose” “no sir not money i think” replied i “in fact sir i believe i have  thing  my breast pocket   tell you  truth i should like  get  put  safety” “to  sure boy quite right” said he “i’ll take it if you like” “i thought perhaps dr livesey” i began “perfectly right”  interrupted very cheerily “perfectly righta gentleman   magistrate and now i come  think  it i might  well ride round there myself  report  him or squire master pew’s dead when all’s done not  i regret it but he’s dead you see  people  make  out against  officer  his majesty’s revenue if make  out they can now i’ll tell you hawkins if you like i’ll take you along” i thanked him heartily   offer  we walked back   hamlet where  horses were by  time i had told mother  my purpose they  all   saddle “dogger” said mr dance “you have  good horse take up this lad behind you” as soon  i  mounted holding   dogger’s belt  supervisor gave  word   party struck out   bouncing trot   road  dr livesey’s house  the captain’s papers we rode hard all  way till we drew up before dr livesey’s door the house  all dark   front mr dance told me  jump down  knock  dogger gave me  stirrup  descend by the door  opened almost  once   maid “is dr livesey in” i asked no she said  had come home   afternoon but had gone up   hall  dine  pass  evening   squire “so there we go boys” said mr dance this time   distance  short i did not mount but ran  dogger’s stirrupleather   lodge gates  up  long leafless moonlit avenue  where  white line   hall buildings looked  either hand  great old gardens here mr dance dismounted  taking me along  him  admitted   word into  house the servant led us down  matted passage  showed us   end into  great library all lined  bookcases  busts upon  top  them where  squire  dr livesey sat pipe  hand  either side   bright fire i had never seen  squire so near  hand he   tall man over six feet high  broad  proportion   had  bluff roughandready face all roughened  reddened  lined  his long travels his eyebrows  very black  moved readily  this gave him  look  some temper not bad you would say but quick  high “come in mr dance” says he very stately  condescending “good evening dance” says  doctor   nod “and good evening  you friend jim what good wind brings you here” the supervisor stood up straight  stiff  told his story like  lesson  you should have seen how  two gentlemen leaned forward  looked  each other  forgot  smoke  their surprise  interest when they heard how my mother went back   inn dr livesey fairly slapped his thigh   squire cried “bravo”  broke his long pipe against  grate long before   done mr trelawney that you  remember   squire’s name had got up  his seat   striding about  room   doctor  if  hear  better had taken off his powdered wig  sat there looking very strange indeed  his own closecropped black poll at last mr dance finished  story “mr dance” said  squire “you   very noble fellow and   riding down  black atrocious miscreant i regard    act  virtue sir like stamping   cockroach this lad hawkins   trump i perceive hawkins  you ring  bell mr dance must have some ale” “and so jim” said  doctor “you have  thing  they  after have you” “here  is sir” said i  gave him  oilskin packet the doctor looked  all over  if his fingers  itching  open it but instead  doing that  put  quietly   pocket  his coat “squire” said he “when dance  had his ale  must  course  off  his majesty’s service but i mean  keep jim hawkins here  sleep  my house   your permission i propose we should have up  cold pie  let him sup” “as you will livesey” said  squire “hawkins  earned better than cold pie” so  big pigeon pie  brought   put   sidetable  i made  hearty supper  i   hungry   hawk while mr dance  further complimented   last dismissed “and now squire” said  doctor “and now livesey” said  squire   same breath “one   time one   time” laughed dr livesey “you have heard  this flint i suppose” “heard  him” cried  squire “heard  him you say he   bloodthirstiest buccaneer  sailed blackbeard   child  flint the spaniards  so prodigiously afraid  him that i tell you sir i  sometimes proud    englishman i’ve seen his topsails  these eyes off trinidad   cowardly son   rumpuncheon  i sailed  put backput back sir into port  spain” “well i’ve heard  him myself  england” said  doctor “but  point is had  money” “money” cried  squire “have you heard  story what  these villains after but money what do they care  but money for what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money” “that we shall soon know” replied  doctor “but you  so confoundedly hotheaded  exclamatory  i cannot get  word in what i want  know  this supposing  i have here  my pocket some clue  where flint buried his treasure   treasure amount  much” “amount sir” cried  squire “it  amount  this if we have  clue you talk about i fit out  ship  bristol dock  take you  hawkins here along  i’ll have  treasure if i search  year” “very well” said  doctor “now then if jim  agreeable we’ll open  packet”   laid  before him   table the bundle  sewn together   doctor had  get out his instrument case  cut  stitches  his medical scissors it contained two thingsa book   sealed paper “first  all we’ll try  book” observed  doctor the squire  i  both peering over his shoulder   opened it  dr livesey had kindly motioned me  come round   sidetable where i had been eating  enjoy  sport   search on  first page there  only some scraps  writing such   man   pen  his hand might make  idleness or practice one   same   tattoo mark “billy bones his fancy” then there  “mr w bones mate” “no more rum” “off palm key  got itt”  some other snatches mostly single words  unintelligible i could not help wondering who    had “got itt”  what “itt”    got a knife  his back  like  not “not much instruction there” said dr livesey   passed on the next ten or twelve pages  filled   curious series  entries there   date  one end   line    other  sum  money   common accountbooks but instead  explanatory writing only  varying number  crosses between  two on

 latitude  longitude  “o ′ ″ o ′ ″” the record lasted over nearly twenty years  amount   separate entries growing larger  time went on    end  grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions  these words appended “bones his pile” “i can’t make head or tail  this” said dr livesey “the thing   clear  noonday” cried  squire “this   blackhearted hound’s accountbook these crosses

bearings  places noted   blank leaves towards  end   table  reducing french english  spanish moneys   common value “thrifty man” cried  doctor “he wasn’t  one   cheated” “and now” said  squire “for

 log up hill  down dale through stage after stage  when i  awakened  last     punch   ribs  i opened my eyes  find  we  standing still before  large building   city street    day had already broken  long time “where  we” i asked “bristol” said tom “get down” mr trelawney had taken up his residence   inn far down  docks  superintend  work upon  schooner thither we had now  walk  our way  my great delight lay along  quays  beside  great multitude  ships  all sizes  rigs  nations in one sailors  singing  their work  another there  men aloft high over my head hanging  threads  seemed no thicker than  spider’s though i had lived   shore all my life i seemed never  have been near  sea till then the smell  tar  salt  something new i saw  most wonderful figureheads  had all been far over  ocean i saw besides many old sailors  rings  their ears  whiskers curled  ringlets  tarry pigtails  their swaggering clumsy seawalk  if i had seen  many kings or archbishops i could not have been more delighted and i  going  sea myself  sea   schooner   piping boatswain  pigtailed singing seamen  sea bound   unknown island   seek  buried treasure while i  still  this delightful dream we came suddenly  front   large inn  met squire trelawney all dressed out like  seaofficer  stout blue cloth coming out   door   smile  his face   capital imitation   sailor’s walk “here you are”  cried “and  doctor came last night  london bravo the ship’s company complete” “oh sir” cried i “when do we sail” “sail” says he “we sail tomorrow”  at  sign   spyglass when i had done breakfasting  squire gave me  note addressed  john silver   sign   spyglass  told me i should easily find  place  following  line   docks  keeping  bright lookout   little tavern   large brass telescope  sign i set off overjoyed  this opportunity  see some more   ships  seamen  picked my way among  great crowd  people  carts  bales   dock  now   busiest until i found  tavern  question it   bright enough little place  entertainment the sign  newly painted  windows had neat red curtains  floor  cleanly sanded there   street  each side   open door  both which made  large low room pretty clear  see in  spite  clouds  tobacco smoke the customers  mostly seafaring men  they talked so loudly  i hung   door almost afraid  enter as i  waiting  man came out   side room    glance i  sure  must  long john his left leg  cut off close   hip  under  left shoulder  carried  crutch which  managed  wonderful dexterity hopping about upon  like  bird he  very tall  strong   face  big   hamplain  pale but intelligent  smiling indeed  seemed   most cheerful spirits whistling   moved about among  tables   merry word or  slap   shoulder   more favoured  his guests now  tell you  truth   very first mention  long john  squire trelawney’s letter i had taken  fear  my mind   might prove    very onelegged sailor whom i had watched  so long   old benbow but one look   man before me  enough i had seen  captain  black dog   blind man pew  i thought i knew what  buccaneer  likea very different creature according  me  this clean  pleasanttempered landlord i plucked up courage  once crossed  threshold  walked right up   man where  stood propped  his crutch talking   customer “mr silver sir” i asked holding out  note “yes my lad” said he “such  my name   sure and who may you be” and then   saw  squire’s letter  seemed  me  give something almost like  start “oh” said he quite loud  offering his hand “i see you  our new cabinboy pleased i am  see you” and  took my hand  his large firm grasp just then one   customers   far side rose suddenly  made   door it  close  him    out   street   moment but his hurry had attracted my notice  i recognized him  glance it   tallowfaced man wanting two fingers who had come first   admiral benbow “oh” i cried “stop him it’s black dog” “i don’t care two coppers who  is” cried silver “but  hasn’t paid his score harry run  catch him” one   others who  nearest  door leaped up  started  pursuit “if   admiral hawke  shall pay his score” cried silver  then relinquishing my hand “who did you say  was”  asked “black what” “dog sir” said i “has mr trelawney not told you   buccaneers he  one  them” “so” cried silver “in my house ben run  help harry one  those swabs  he was  you drinking  him morgan step up here” the man whom  called morganan old greyhaired mahoganyfaced sailorcame forward pretty sheepishly rolling his quid “now morgan” said long john very sternly “you never clapped your eyes   blackblack dog before did you now” “not i sir” said morgan   salute “you didn’t know his name did you” “no sir” “by  powers tom morgan it’s  good  you” exclaimed  landlord “if you had been mixed up   like  that you would never have put another foot  my house you may lay  that and what   saying  you” “i don’t rightly know sir” answered morgan “do you call   head  your shoulders or  blessed deadeye” cried long john “don’t rightly know don’t you perhaps you don’t happen  rightly know who you  speaking to perhaps come now what   jawingv’yages cap’ns ships pipe up what  it” “we  atalkin’  keelhauling” answered morgan “keelhauling  you and  mighty suitable thing too  you may lay  that get back  your place   lubber tom” and then  morgan rolled back  his seat silver added  me   confidential whisper   very flattering  i thought “he’s quite  honest man tom morgan on’y stupid and now”  ran  again aloud “let’s seeblack dog no i don’t know  name not i yet i kind  think i’veyes i’ve seen  swab he used  come here   blind beggar  used” “that  did you may  sure” said i “i knew  blind man too his name  pew” “it was” cried silver now quite excited “pew that  his name  certain ah  looked  shark  did if we run down this black dog now there’ll  news  cap’n trelawney ben’s  good runner few seamen run better than ben he should run him down hand over hand   powers he talked o’ keelhauling did he i’ll keelhaul him” all  time   jerking out these phrases   stumping up  down  tavern  his crutch slapping tables  his hand  giving such  show  excitement  would have convinced  old bailey judge or  bow street runner my suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened  finding black dog   spyglass  i watched  cook narrowly but   too deep  too ready  too clever  me    time  two men had come back out  breath  confessed  they had lost  track   crowd  been scolded like thieves i would have gone bail   innocence  long john silver “see here now hawkins” said he “here’s  blessed hard thing   man like me now ain’t it there’s cap’n trelawneywhat’s   think here i have this confounded son   dutchman sitting  my own house drinking  my own rum here you comes  tells me   plain  here i let him give us all  slip before my blessed deadlights now hawkins you do me justice   cap’n you’re  lad you are but you’re  smart  paint i see  when you first come in now here  is what could i do  this old timber i hobble on when i   a b master mariner i’d have come up alongside  him hand over hand  broached him    brace  old shakes i would but now” and then all   sudden  stopped  his jaw dropped  though  had remembered something “the score”  burst out “three goes o’ rum why shiver my timbers if i hadn’t forgotten my score” and falling   bench  laughed until  tears ran down his cheeks i could not help joining  we laughed together peal after peal until  tavern rang again “why what  precious old seacalf i am”  said  last wiping his cheeks “you  me should get  well hawkins  i’ll take my davy i should  rated ship’s boy but come now stand   go about this won’t do dooty  dooty messmates i’ll put  my old cockerel hat  step along  you  cap’n trelawney  report this here affair for mind you it’s serious young hawkins  neither you nor me’s come out    what i should make so bold   call credit nor you neither says you not smartnone   pair  us smart but dash my buttons that   good un about my score” and  began  laugh again   so heartily  though i did not see  joke   did i  again obliged  join him  his mirth on our little walk along  quays  made himself  most interesting companion telling me about  different ships  we passed by their rig tonnage  nationality explaining  work   going forwardhow one  discharging another taking  cargo   third making ready  seaand every now  then telling me some little anecdote  ships or seamen or repeating  nautical phrase till i had learned  perfectly i began  see  here  one   best  possible shipmates when we got   inn  squire  dr livesey  seated together finishing  quart  ale   toast  it before they should go aboard  schooner   visit  inspection long john told  story  first  last   great deal  spirit   most perfect truth “that  how  were now weren’t it hawkins”  would say now  again  i could always bear him entirely out the two gentlemen regretted  black dog had got away but we all agreed there  nothing   done  after  had been complimented long john took up his crutch  departed “all hands aboard  four this afternoon” shouted  squire after him “aye aye sir” cried  cook   passage “well squire” said dr livesey “i don’t put much faith  your discoveries   general thing but i  say this john silver suits me” “the man’s  perfect trump” declared  squire “and now” added  doctor “jim may come  board  us may  not” “to  sure  may” says squire “take your hat hawkins  we’ll see  ship”  powder  arms the hispaniola lay some way out  we went under  figureheads  round  sterns  many other ships  their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel  sometimes swung above us at last however we got alongside   met  saluted  we stepped aboard   mate mr arrow  brown old sailor  earrings  his ears   squint he   squire  very thick  friendly but i soon observed  things  not  same between mr trelawney   captain this last   sharplooking man who seemed angry  everything  board   soon  tell us why  we had hardly got down into  cabin when  sailor followed us “captain smollett sir axing  speak  you” said he “i am always   captain’s orders show him in” said  squire the captain who  close behind his messenger entered  once  shut  door behind him “well captain smollett what have you  say all well i hope all shipshape  seaworthy” “well sir” said  captain “better speak plain i believe even   risk  offence i don’t like this cruise i don’t like  men  i don’t like my officer that’s short  sweet” “perhaps sir you don’t like  ship” inquired  squire very angry  i could see “i can’t speak   that sir not having seen her tried” said  captain “she seems  clever craft more i can’t say” “possibly sir you may not like your employer either” says  squire but here dr livesey cut in “stay  bit” said he “stay  bit no use  such questions   but  produce ill feeling the captain  said too much or   said too little  i’m bound  say  i require  explanation  his words you don’t you say like this cruise now why” “i  engaged sir  what we call sealed orders  sail this ship   gentleman where  should bid me” said  captain “so far so good but now i find  every man before  mast knows more than i do i don’t call  fair now do you” “no” said dr livesey “i don’t” “next” said  captain “i learn we  going after treasurehear   my own hands mind you now treasure  ticklish work i don’t like treasure voyages  any account  i don’t like them above all when they  secret  when begging your pardon mr trelawney  secret  been told   parrot” “silver’s parrot” asked  squire “it’s  way  speaking” said  captain “blabbed i mean it’s my belief neither  you gentlemen know what you  about but i’ll tell you my way  itlife or death   close run” “that  all clear and i dare say true enough” replied dr livesey “we take  risk but we  not so ignorant  you believe us next you say you don’t like  crew are they not good seamen” “i don’t like them sir” returned captain smollett “and i think i should have had  choosing  my own hands if you go  that” “perhaps you should” replied  doctor “my friend should perhaps have taken you along  him but  slight if there  one  unintentional and you don’t like mr arrow” “i don’t sir i believe he’s  good seaman but he’s too free   crew    good officer a mate should keep himself  himselfshouldn’t drink   men before  mast” “do you mean  drinks” cried  squire “no sir” replied  captain “only  he’s too familiar” “well now   short  long  it captain” asked  doctor “tell us what you want” “well gentlemen  you determined  go  this cruise” “like iron” answered  squire “very good” said  captain “then  you’ve heard me very patiently saying things  i could not prove hear me  few words more they  putting  powder   arms   fore hold now you have  good place under  cabin why not put them therefirst point then you  bringing four  your own people  you  they tell me some  them    berthed forward why not give them  berths here beside  cabinsecond point” “any more” asked mr trelawney “one more” said  captain “there’s been too much blabbing already” “far too much” agreed  doctor “i’ll tell you what i’ve heard myself” continued captain smollett “that you have  map   island  there’s crosses   map  show where treasure is    island lies” and then  named  latitude  longitude exactly “i never told that” cried  squire “to  soul” “the hands know it sir” returned  captain “livesey  must have been you or hawkins” cried  squire “it doesn’t much matter who  was” replied  doctor and i could see  neither  nor  captain paid much regard  mr trelawney’s protestations neither did i   sure   so loose  talker yet  this case i believe   really right   nobody had told  situation   island “well gentlemen” continued  captain “i don’t know who  this map but i make   point  shall  kept secret even  me  mr arrow otherwise i would ask you  let me resign” “i see” said  doctor “you wish us  keep this matter dark   make  garrison   stern part   ship manned  my friend’s own people  provided  all  arms  powder  board in other words you fear  mutiny” “sir” said captain smollett “with no intention  take offence i deny your right  put words into my mouth no captain sir would  justified  going  sea  all if  had ground enough  say that as  mr arrow i believe him thoroughly honest some   men   same all may   what i know but i am responsible   ship’s safety   life  every man jack aboard  her i see things going  i think not quite right and i ask you  take certain precautions or let me resign my berth and that’s all” “captain smollett” began  doctor   smile “did ever you hear  fable   mountain   mouse you’ll excuse me i dare say but you remind me   fable when you came  here i’ll stake my wig you meant more than this” “doctor” said  captain “you  smart when i came  here i meant  get discharged i had no thought  mr trelawney would hear  word” “no more i would” cried  squire “had livesey not been here i should have seen you   deuce as  is i have heard you i  do  you desire but i think  worse  you” “that’s  you please sir” said  captain “you’ll find i do my duty” and    took his leave “trelawney” said  doctor “contrary  all my notions i believed you have managed  get two honest men  board  youthat man  john silver” “silver if you like” cried  squire “but    intolerable humbug i declare i think his conduct unmanly unsailorly  downright unenglish” “well” says  doctor “we shall see” when we came  deck  men had begun already  take out  arms  powder yohoing  their work while  captain  mr arrow stood  superintending the new arrangement  quite  my liking the whole schooner had been overhauled six berths had been made astern out  what had been  afterpart   main hold  this set  cabins  only joined   galley  forecastle   sparred passage   port side it had been originally meant   captain mr arrow hunter joyce  doctor   squire   occupy these six berths now redruth  i   get two

 mate seemed pleased   arrangement even he perhaps had been doubtful    crew but   only guess   you shall hear we had not long  benefit  his opinion we  all hard  work changing  powder   berths when  last man or two  long john along  them came off   shoreboat the cook came up  side like  monkey  cleverness   soon   saw what  doing “so ho mates” says he “what’s this” “we’re achanging   powder jack” answers one “why   powers” cried long john “if we do we’ll miss  morning tide” “my orders” said  captain shortly “you may go below my man hands  want supper” “aye aye sir” answered  cook  touching his forelock  disappeared  once   direction  his galley “that’s  good man captain” said  doctor “very likely sir” replied captain smollett “easy  that meneasy”  ran on   fellows who  shifting  powder  then suddenly observing me examining  swivel we carried amidships  long brass nine “here you ship’s boy”  cried “out o’ that off  you   cook  get some work” and then  i  hurrying off i heard him say quite loudly   doctor “i’ll have no favourites  my ship” i assure you i  quite   squire’s way  thinking  hated  captain deeply  the voyage all  night we    great bustle getting things stowed  their place  boatfuls   squire’s friends mr blandly   like coming off  wish him  good voyage   safe return we never had  night   admiral benbow when i had half  work  i  dogtired when  little before dawn

bustling  their places   glimmer   ship’s lanterns “now barbecue tip us  stave” cried one voice “the old one” cried another “aye aye mates” said long john who  standing by  his crutch under his arm   once broke out   air  words i knew so well “fifteen men   dead man’s chest” and then  whole crew bore chorus “yohoho   bottle  rum” and   third “ho” drove  bars before them   will even   exciting moment  carried me back   old admiral benbow   second  i seemed  hear  voice   captain piping   chorus but soon  anchor  short up soon   hanging dripping   bows soon  sails began  draw   land

proved    good ship  crew  capable seamen   captain thoroughly understood his business but before we came  length  treasure island two or three things had happened which require   known mr arrow first  all turned out even worse than  captain had feared he had no command among  men  people did what they pleased  him but    no means  worst  it  after  day or two  sea  began  appear  deck  hazy eye red cheeks stuttering tongue  other marks  drunkenness time after time   ordered below  disgrace sometimes  fell  cut himself sometimes  lay all day long  his little bunk  one side   companion sometimes   day or two  would  almost sober  attend  his work  least passably in  meantime we could never make out where  got  drink that   ship’s mystery watch him  we pleased we could do nothing  solve it  when we asked him  his face  would only laugh if   drunk  if   sober deny solemnly   ever tasted anything but water he  not only useless   officer   bad influence amongst  men but   plain   this rate  must soon kill himself outright so nobody  much surprised nor very sorry when one dark night   head sea  disappeared entirely   seen no more “overboard” said  captain “well gentlemen  saves  trouble  putting him  irons” but there we were without  mate    necessary  course  advance one   men the boatswain job anderson   likeliest man aboard  though  kept his old title  served   way  mate

coxswain  me “he had good schooling  his young days  can speak like  book when so minded  bravea lion’s nothing alongside  long john i seen him grapple four  knock their heads togetherhim unarmed” all

bones about  matter  despised  captain the captain  his part never spoke but when   spoken to  then sharp  short  dry  not  word wasted he owned when driven into  corner   seemed  have been wrong about  crew  some  them   brisk   wanted  see  all had behaved fairly well as   ship  had taken  downright fancy  her “she’ll lie  point nearer  wind than  man   right  expect  his own married wife sir but”  would add “all i say is we’re not home again  i don’t like  cruise” the squire  this would turn away  march up  down  deck chin  air “a trifle more   man”  would say “and i shall explode” we had some heavy weather which only proved  qualities   hispaniola every man  board seemed well content  they must have been hard  please if they had been otherwise    my belief there  never  ship’s company so spoiled since noah put  sea double grog  going   least excuse there  duff  odd days as  instance if  squire heard   any man’s birthday  always  barrel  apples standing broached   waist

manner  speaking i laid  nine hundred safe  england  two thousand after flint that ain’t bad   man before  mastall safe  bank ’tain’t earning now it’s saving does it you may lay  that where’s all england’s men now i dunno where’s flint’s why most  ’em aboard here  glad  get  duffbeen begging before that some  ’em old pew  had lost his sight  might have thought shame spends twelve hundred pound   year like  lord  parliament where   now well he’s dead now  under hatches but  two year before that shiver my timbers  man  starving he begged   stole   cut throats  starved  that   powers” “well  ain’t much use after all” said  young seaman “’tain’t much use  fools you may lay  itthat nor nothing” cried silver “but now you look here you’re young you are but you’re  smart  paint i see  when i set my eyes  you  i’ll talk  you like  man” you may imagine how i felt when i heard this abominable old rogue addressing another   very same words  flattery   had used  myself i think if i had been able  i would have killed him through  barrel meantime  ran on little supposing   overheard “here   about gentlemen  fortune they lives rough  they risk swinging but they eat  drink like fightingcocks  when  cruise  done why it’s hundreds  pounds instead  hundreds  farthings  their pockets now  most goes  rum   good fling   sea again  their shirts but that’s not  course i lay i puts  all away some

daren’t show face  bristol after this” “why where might you suppose  was” asked silver derisively “at bristol  banks  places” answered his companion “it were” said  cook “it  when we weighed anchor but my old missis   all  now and  spyglass  sold lease  goodwill  rigging   old girl’s off  meet me i would tell you where  i trust you but it’d make jealousy among  mates” “and can you trust your missis” asked  other “gentlemen  fortune” returned  cook “usually trusts little among themselves  right they are you may lay  it but i have  way  me i have when  mate brings  slip  his cableone  knows me i meanit won’t    same world  old john there  some   feared  pew  some   feared  flint but flint his own self  feared  me feared  was  proud they   roughest crew afloat  flint’s  devil himself

too” answered silver shaking hands so heartily  all  barrel shook “and  finer figurehead   gentleman  fortune i never clapped my eyes on” by this time i had begun  understand  meaning  their terms by  “gentleman  fortune” they plainly meant neither more nor less than  common pirate   little scene  i had overheard   last act   corruption  one   honest handsperhaps   last one left aboard but  this point i  soon   relieved  silver giving  little whistle  third man strolled up  sat down   party “dick’s square” said silver “oh i know’d dick  square” returned  voice   coxswain israel hands “he’s no fool  dick” and  turned his quid  spat “but look here”  went on “here’s what i want  know barbecue how long  we agoing  stand off   like  blessed bumboat i’ve had a’most enough o’ cap’n smollett he’s hazed me long enough  thunder i want  go into  cabin i do i want their pickles  wines  that” “israel” said silver “your head ain’t much account nor ever was but you’re able  hear i reckon leastways your ears  big enough now here’s what i say you’ll berth forward  you’ll live hard  you’ll speak soft  you’ll keep sober till i give  word  you may lay  that my son” “well i don’t say no do i” growled  coxswain “what i say is when that’s what i say” “when by  powers” cried silver “well now if you want  know i’ll tell you when the last moment i can manage  that’s when here’s  firstrate seaman cap’n smollett sails  blessed ship  us here’s this squire  doctor   map  suchi don’t know where  is do i no more do you says you well then i mean this squire  doctor shall find  stuff  help us  get  aboard   powers then we’ll see if i  sure  you all sons  double dutchmen i’d have cap’n smollett navigate us halfway back again before i struck” “why we’re all seamen aboard here i should think” said  lad dick “we’re all forecastle hands you mean” snapped silver “we can steer  course but who’s  set one that’s what all you gentlemen split on first  last if i had my way i’d have cap’n smollett work us back into  trades  least then we’d have no blessed miscalculations   spoonful  water  day but i know  sort you are i’ll finish  ’em   island  soon’s  blunt’s  board   pity  is but you’re never happy till you’re drunk split my sides i’ve  sick heart  sail   likes  you” “easy all long john” cried israel “who’s acrossin’  you” “why how many tall ships think ye now have i seen laid aboard and how many brisk lads drying   sun  execution dock” cried silver “and all  this same hurry  hurry  hurry you hear me i seen  thing or two  sea i have if you would on’y lay your course   p’int  windward you would ride  carriages you would but not you i know you you’ll have your mouthful  rum tomorrow  go hang” “everybody knowed you   kind   chapling john but there’s others  could hand  steer  well  you” said israel “they liked  bit o’ fun they did they wasn’t so high  dry nohow but took their fling like jolly companions every one” “so” says silver “well  where  they now pew   sort   died  beggarman flint was   died  rum  savannah ah they   sweet crew they was on’y where  they” “but” asked dick “when we do lay ’em athwart what  we  do  ’em anyhow” “there’s  man  me” cried  cook admiringly “that’s what i call business well what would you think put ’em ashore like maroons that would have been england’s way or cut ’em down like  much pork that would have been flint’s or billy bones’s” “billy   man  that” said israel “‘dead men don’t bite’ says he well he’s dead now hisself  knows  long  short   now  if ever  rough hand come  port   billy” “right you are” said silver “rough  ready but mark you here i’m  easy mani’m quite  gentleman says you but this time it’s serious dooty  dooty mates i give my votedeath when i’m  parlyment  riding  my coach i don’t want none  these sealawyers   cabin acoming home unlooked for like  devil  prayers wait  what i say but when  time comes why let her rip” “john” cries  coxswain “you’re  man” “you’ll say so israel when you see” said silver “only one thing i claimi claim trelawney i’ll wring his calf’s head off his body  these hands dick”  added breaking off “you just jump up like  sweet lad  get me  apple  wet my pipe like” you may fancy  terror i  in i should have leaped out  run   if i had found  strength but my limbs  heart alike misgave me i heard dick begin  rise  then someone seemingly stopped him   voice  hands exclaimed “oh stow that don’t you get sucking   bilge john let’s have  go   rum” “dick” said silver “i trust you i’ve  gauge   keg mind there’s  key you fill  pannikin  bring  up” terrified  i was i could not help thinking  myself  this must have been how mr arrow got  strong waters  destroyed him dick  gone but  little while  during his absence israel spoke straight    cook’s ear it  but  word or two  i could catch  yet i gathered some important news  besides other scraps  tended   same purpose this whole clause  audible “not another man  them’ll jine” hence there  still faithful men  board when dick returned one after another   trio took  pannikin  drankone “to luck” another   “here’s  old flint”  silver himself saying   kind  song “here’s  ourselves  hold your luff plenty  prizes  plenty  duff” just then  sort  brightness fell upon me   barrel  looking up i found  moon had risen   silvering  mizzentop  shining white   luff   foresail  almost   same time  voice   lookout shouted “land ho”  council  war there   great rush  feet across  deck i could hear people tumbling up   cabin   forecastle  slipping   instant outside my barrel i dived behind  foresail made  double towards  stern  came out upon  open deck  time  join hunter  dr livesey   rush   weather bow there all hands  already congregated a belt  fog had lifted almost simultaneously   appearance   moon away   southwest  us we saw two low hills about  couple  miles apart  rising behind one  them  third  higher hill whose peak  still buried   fog all three seemed sharp  conical  figure so much i saw almost   dream  i had not yet recovered  my horrid fear   minute or two before and then i heard  voice  captain smollett issuing orders the hispaniola  laid  couple  points nearer  wind  now sailed  course  would just clear  island   east “and now men” said  captain when all  sheeted home “has any one  you ever seen  land ahead” “i have sir” said silver “i’ve watered there   trader i  cook in” “the anchorage    south behind  islet i fancy” asked  captain “yes sir skeleton island they calls it it   main place  pirates once   hand we had  board knowed all their names  it that hill   nor’ard they calls  foremast hill there  three hills   row running south’ardfore main  mizzen sir but  mainthat’s  big un   cloud  itthey usually calls  spyglass  reason   lookout they kept when they    anchorage cleaning  it’s there they cleaned their ships sir asking your pardon” “i have  chart here” says captain smollett “see if that’s  place” long john’s eyes burned  his head   took  chart but   fresh look   paper i knew   doomed  disappointment this  not  map we found  billy bones’s chest but  accurate copy complete  all thingsnames  heights  soundingswith  single exception   red crosses   written notes sharp  must have been his annoyance silver had  strength  mind  hide it “yes sir” said he “this   spot   sure  very prettily drawed out who might have done that i wonder the pirates  too ignorant i reckon aye here  is ‘capt kidd’s anchorage’just  name my shipmate called it there’s  strong current runs along  south  then away nor’ard up  west coast right you was sir” says he “to haul your wind  keep  weather   island leastways if such  your intention   enter  careen  there ain’t no better place    these waters” “thank you my man” says captain smollett “i’ll ask you later   give us  help you may go” i  surprised   coolness  which john avowed his knowledge   island  i own i  halffrightened when i saw him drawing nearer  myself he did not know   sure  i had overheard his council   apple barrel  yet i had  this time taken such  horror  his cruelty duplicity  power  i could scarce conceal  shudder when  laid his hand upon my arm “ah” says he “this here   sweet spot this islanda sweet spot   lad  get ashore on you’ll bathe  you’ll climb trees  you’ll hunt goats you will  you’ll get aloft  them hills like  goat yourself why  makes me young again i  going  forget my timber leg i was it’s  pleasant thing   young  have ten toes  you may lay  that when you want  go  bit  exploring you just ask old john  he’ll put up  snack  you  take along” and clapping me   friendliest way upon  shoulder  hobbled off forward  went below captain smollett  squire  dr livesey  talking together   quarterdeck  anxious  i   tell them my story i durst not interrupt them openly while i  still casting about  my thoughts  find some probable excuse dr livesey called me  his side he had left his pipe below  being  slave  tobacco had meant  i should fetch it but  soon  i  near enough  speak  not   overheard i broke immediately “doctor let me speak get  captain  squire down   cabin  then make some pretence  send  me i have terrible news” the doctor changed countenance  little but next moment   master  himself “thank you jim” said  quite loudly “that  all i wanted  know”  if  had asked me  question and    turned  his heel  rejoined  other two they spoke together   little  though none  them started or raised his voice or so much  whistled   plain enough  dr livesey had communicated my request   next thing  i heard   captain giving  order  job anderson  all hands  piped  deck “my lads” said captain smollett “i’ve  word  say  you this land  we have sighted   place we have been sailing for mr trelawney being  very openhanded gentleman  we all know  just asked me  word or two   i  able  tell him  every man  board had done his duty alow  aloft  i never ask  see  done better why   i   doctor  going below   cabin  drink your health  luck  you’ll have grog served out  you  drink our health  luck i’ll tell you what i think  this i think  handsome and if you think  i do you’ll give  good seacheer   gentleman  does it” the cheer followedthat   matter  course but  rang out so full  hearty  i confess i could hardly believe these same men  plotting  our blood “one more cheer  cap’n smollett” cried long john when  first had subsided and this also  given   will on  top    three gentlemen went below  not long after word  sent forward  jim hawkins  wanted   cabin i found them all three seated round  table  bottle  spanish wine  some raisins before them   doctor smoking away  his wig  his lap  that i knew   sign    agitated the stern window  open     warm night  you could see  moon shining behind   ship’s wake “now hawkins” said  squire “you have something  say speak up” i did  i  bid   short  i could make it told  whole details  silver’s conversation nobody interrupted me till i  done nor did any one   three  them make so much   movement but they kept their eyes upon my face  first  last “jim” said dr livesey “take  seat” and they made me sit down  table beside them poured me out  glass  wine filled my hands  raisins  all three one after  other  each   bow drank my good health  their service  me  my luck  courage “now captain” said  squire “you  right  i  wrong i own myself  ass  i await your orders” “no more  ass than i sir” returned  captain “i never heard   crew  meant  mutiny but what showed signs before  any man  had  eye  his head  see  mischief  take steps according but this crew”  added “beats me” “captain” said  doctor “with your permission that’s silver a very remarkable man” “he’d look remarkably well   yardarm sir” returned  captain “but this  talk this don’t lead  anything i see three or four points   mr trelawney’s permission i’ll name them” “you sir   captain it   you  speak” says mr trelawney grandly “first point” began mr smollett “we must go on because we can’t turn back if i gave  word  go about they would rise  once second point we have time before usat least until this treasure’s found third point there  faithful hands now sir it’s got  come  blows sooner or later  what i propose   take time   forelock   saying is  come  blows some fine day when they least expect it we can count i take it  your own home servants mr trelawney” “as upon myself” declared  squire “three” reckoned  captain “ourselves make seven counting hawkins here now about  honest hands” “most likely trelawney’s own men” said  doctor “those  had picked up  himself before  lit  silver” “nay” replied  squire “hands  one  mine” “i did think i could have trusted hands” added  captain “and  think  they’re all englishmen” broke out  squire “sir i could find   my heart  blow  ship up” “well gentlemen” said  captain “the best  i can say  not much we must lay to if you please  keep  bright lookout it’s trying   man i know it would  pleasanter  come  blows but there’s no help   till we know our men lay to  whistle   wind that’s my view” “jim here” said  doctor “can help us more than anyone the men  not shy  him  jim   noticing lad” “hawkins i put prodigious faith  you” added  squire i began  feel pretty desperate  this  i felt altogether helpless  yet   odd train  circumstances   indeed through me  safety came in  meantime talk  we pleased there  only seven out   twentysix  whom we knew we could rely  out  these seven one   boy so   grown men  our side  six  their nineteen part threemy shore adventure  how my shore adventure began the appearance   island when i came  deck next morning  altogether changed although  breeze had now utterly ceased we had made  great deal  way during  night   now lying becalmed about half  mile   southeast   low eastern coast greycoloured woods covered  large part   surface this even tint  indeed broken up  streaks  yellow sandbreak   lower lands   many tall trees   pine family outtopping  otherssome singly some  clumps but  general colouring  uniform  sad the hills ran up clear above  vegetation  spires  naked rock all  strangely shaped   spyglass which   three or four hundred feet  tallest   island  likewise  strangest  configuration running up sheer  almost every side  then suddenly cut off   top like  pedestal  put  statue on the hispaniola  rolling scuppers under   ocean swell the booms  tearing   blocks  rudder  banging   fro   whole ship creaking groaning  jumping like  manufactory i had  cling tight   backstay   world turned giddily before my eyes  though i   good enough sailor when there  way on this standing still  being rolled about like  bottle   thing i never learned  stand without  qualm or so above all   morning   empty stomach perhaps   thisperhaps    look   island   grey melancholy woods  wild stone spires   surf  we could both see  hear foaming  thundering   steep beachat least although  sun shone bright  hot   shore birds  fishing  crying all around us  you would have thought anyone would have been glad  get  land after being so long  sea my heart sank   saying is into my boots    first look onward i hated  very thought  treasure island we had  dreary morning’s work before us  there  no sign  any wind   boats had   got out  manned   ship warped three or four miles round  corner   island  up  narrow passage   haven behind skeleton island i volunteered  one   boats where i had  course no business the heat  sweltering   men grumbled fiercely over their work anderson   command  my boat  instead  keeping  crew  order  grumbled  loud   worst “well”  said   oath “it’s not forever” i thought this   very bad sign  up   day  men had gone briskly  willingly about their business but  very sight   island had relaxed  cords  discipline all  way in long john stood   steersman  conned  ship he knew  passage like  palm  his hand  though  man   chains got everywhere more water than  down   chart john never hesitated once “there’s  strong scour   ebb”  said “and this here passage  been dug out   manner  speaking   spade” we brought up just where  anchor    chart about  third   mile  each shore  mainland  one side  skeleton island   other the bottom  clean sand the plunge  our anchor sent up clouds  birds wheeling  crying over  woods but  less than  minute they  down again  all  once more silent the place  entirely landlocked buried  woods  trees coming right down  highwater mark  shores mostly flat   hilltops standing round   distance   sort  amphitheatre one here one there two little rivers or rather two swamps emptied out into this pond  you might call it   foliage round  part   shore had  kind  poisonous brightness from  ship we could see nothing   house or stockade  they  quite buried among trees  if  had not been   chart   companion we might have been  first  had ever anchored there since  island arose out   seas there  not  breath  air moving nor  sound but    surf booming half  mile away along  beaches  against  rocks outside a peculiar stagnant smell hung over  anchoragea smell  sodden leaves  rotting tree trunks i observed  doctor sniffing  sniffing like someone tasting  bad egg “i don’t know about treasure”  said “but i’ll stake my wig there’s fever here” if  conduct   men had been alarming   boat  became truly threatening when they had come aboard they lay about  deck growling together  talk the slightest order  received   black look  grudgingly  carelessly obeyed even  honest hands must have caught  infection  there  not one man aboard  mend another mutiny   plain hung over us like  thundercloud and   not only we   cabin party who perceived  danger long john  hard  work going  group  group spending himself  good advice    example no man could have shown  better he fairly outstripped himself  willingness  civility   all smiles  everyone if  order  given john would   his crutch   instant   cheeriest “aye aye sir”   world  when there  nothing else  do  kept up one song after another  if  conceal  discontent   rest of all  gloomy features   gloomy afternoon this obvious anxiety   part  long john appeared  worst we held  council   cabin “sir” said  captain “if i risk another order  whole ship’ll come about our ears   run you see sir here  is i get  rough answer do i not well if i speak back pikes   going  two shakes if i don’t silver  see there’s something under that   game’s up now we’ve only one man  rely on” “and who  that” asked  squire “silver sir” returned  captain “he’s  anxious  you  i  smother things up this   tiff he’d soon talk ’em out   if  had  chance  what i propose  do   give him  chance let’s allow  men  afternoon ashore if they all go why we’ll fight  ship if they none  them go well then we hold  cabin  god defend  right if some go you mark my words sir silver’ll bring ’em aboard again  mild  lambs” it  so decided loaded pistols  served out  all  sure men hunter joyce  redruth  taken into our confidence  received  news  less surprise   better spirit than we had looked for  then  captain went  deck  addressed  crew “my lads” said he “we’ve had  hot day   all tired  out  sorts a turn ashore’ll hurt nobodythe boats  still   water you can take  gigs   many  please may go ashore   afternoon i’ll fire  gun half  hour before sundown” i believe  silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure  soon  they  landed  they all came out  their sulks   moment  gave  cheer  started  echo   faraway hill  sent  birds once more flying  squalling round  anchorage the captain  too bright     way he whipped out  sight   moment leaving silver  arrange  party  i fancy    well  did so had  been  deck  could no longer so much  have pretended not  understand  situation it   plain  day silver   captain   mighty rebellious crew  had  it the honest handsand i  soon  see  proved  there  such  boardmust have been very stupid fellows or rather i suppose  truth  this  all hands  disaffected   example   ringleadersonly some more some less   few being good fellows   main could neither  led nor driven any further it  one thing   idle  skulk  quite another  take  ship  murder  number  innocent men at last however  party  made up six fellows   stay  board   remaining thirteen including silver began  embark then    there came into my head  first   mad notions  contributed so much  save our lives if six men  left  silver   plain our party could not take  fight  ship  since only six  left   equally plain   cabin party had no present need  my assistance it occurred  me  once  go ashore in  jiffy i had slipped over  side  curled up   foresheets   nearest boat  almost   same moment she shoved off no one took notice  me only  bow oar saying “is  you jim keep your head down” but silver   other boat looked sharply over  called out  know if   me    moment i began  regret what i had done the crews raced   beach but  boat i  in having some start  being  once  lighter   better manned shot far ahead  her consort   bow had struck among  shoreside trees  i had caught  branch  swung myself out  plunged into  nearest thicket while silver   rest  still  hundred yards behind “jim jim” i heard him shouting but you may suppose i paid no heed jumping ducking  breaking through i ran straight before my nose till i could run no longer  the first blow i was so pleased  having given  slip  long john  i began  enjoy myself  look around me  some interest   strange land  i  in i had crossed  marshy tract full  willows bulrushes  odd outlandish swampy trees  i had now come out upon  skirts   open piece  undulating sandy country about  mile long dotted   few pines   great number  contorted trees not unlike  oak  growth but pale   foliage like willows on  far side   open stood one   hills  two quaint craggy peaks shining vividly   sun i now felt   first time  joy  exploration the isle  uninhabited my shipmates i had left behind  nothing lived  front  me but dumb brutes  fowls i turned hither  thither among  trees here  there  flowering plants unknown  me here  there i saw snakes  one raised his head   ledge  rock  hissed  me   noise not unlike  spinning   top little did i suppose     deadly enemy    noise   famous rattle then i came   long thicket  these oaklike treeslive or evergreen oaks i heard afterwards they should  calledwhich grew low along  sand like brambles  boughs curiously twisted  foliage compact like thatch the thicket stretched down   top  one   sandy knolls spreading  growing taller   went until  reached  margin   broad reedy fen through which  nearest   little rivers soaked  way into  anchorage the marsh  steaming   strong sun   outline   spyglass trembled through  haze all  once there began  go  sort  bustle among  bulrushes  wild duck flew up   quack another followed  soon over  whole surface   marsh  great cloud  birds hung screaming  circling   air i judged  once  some  my shipmates must  drawing near along  borders   fen nor  i deceived  soon i heard  very distant  low tones   human voice which  i continued  give ear grew steadily louder  nearer this put me   great fear  i crawled under cover   nearest liveoak  squatted there hearkening  silent   mouse another voice answered  then  first voice which i now recognized   silver’s once more took up  story  ran    long while   stream only now  again interrupted   other by  sound they must have been talking earnestly  almost fiercely but no distinct word came  my hearing at last  speakers seemed  have paused  perhaps  have sat down  not only did they cease  draw any nearer but  birds themselves began  grow more quiet   settle again  their places   swamp and now i began  feel  i  neglecting my business  since i had been so foolhardy   come ashore  these desperadoes  least i could do   overhear them  their councils   my plain  obvious duty   draw  close  i could manage under  favourable ambush   crouching trees i could tell  direction   speakers pretty exactly not only   sound  their voices but   behaviour   few birds  still hung  alarm above  heads   intruders crawling  all fours i made steadily but slowly towards them till  last raising my head   aperture among  leaves i could see clear down into  little green dell beside  marsh  closely set about  trees where long john silver  another   crew stood face  face  conversation the sun beat full upon them silver had thrown his hat beside him   ground  his great smooth blond face all shining  heat  lifted   other man’s   kind  appeal “mate”   saying “it’s because i thinks gold dust  yougold dust  you may lay  that if i hadn’t took  you like pitch do you think i’d have been here awarning  you all’s upyou can’t make nor mend it’s  save your neck  i’m aspeaking  if one   wild uns knew it where’d i be tomnow tell me where’d i be” “silver” said  other manand i observed   not only red   face but spoke  hoarse   crow  his voice shook too like  taut rope“silver” says he “you’re old  you’re honest or   name  it  you’ve money too which lots  poor sailors hasn’t  you’re brave or i’m mistook and  you tell me you’ll let yourself  led away   kind   mess  swabs not you as sure  god sees me i’d sooner lose my hand if i turn agin my dooty” and then all   sudden   interrupted   noise i had found one   honest handswell here   same moment came news  another far away out   marsh there arose all   sudden  sound like  cry  anger then another   back  it  then one horrid longdrawn scream the rocks   spyglass reechoed   score  times  whole troop  marshbirds rose again darkening heaven   simultaneous whirr  long after  death yell  still ringing  my brain silence had reestablished  empire  only  rustle   redescending birds   boom   distant surges disturbed  languor   afternoon tom had leaped   sound like  horse   spur but silver had not winked  eye he stood where  was resting lightly  his crutch watching his companion like  snake about  spring “john” said  sailor stretching out his hand “hands off” cried silver leaping back  yard   seemed  me   speed  security   trained gymnast “hands off if you like john silver” said  other “it’s  black conscience  can make you feared  me but  heaven’s name tell me what  that” “that” returned silver smiling away but warier than ever his eye  mere pinpoint  his big face but gleaming like  crumb  glass “that oh i reckon that’ll  alan” and  this point tom flashed out like  hero “alan”  cried “then rest his soul   true seaman and   you john silver long you’ve been  mate  mine but you’re mate

no time given him  recover silver agile   monkey even without leg or crutch    top  him next moment  had twice buried his knife up   hilt   defenceless body from my place  ambush i could hear him pant aloud   struck  blows i do not know what  rightly   faint but i do know    next little while  whole world swam away  before me   whirling mist silver   birds   tall spyglass hilltop going round  round  topsyturvy before my eyes  all manner  bells ringing  distant voices shouting  my ear when i came again  myself  monster had pulled himself together his crutch under his arm his hat upon his head just before him tom lay motionless upon  sward but  murderer minded him not  whit cleansing his bloodstained knife  while upon  wisp  grass everything else  unchanged  sun still shining mercilessly   steaming marsh   tall pinnacle   mountain  i could scarce persuade myself  murder had been actually done   human life cruelly cut short  moment since before my eyes but now john put his hand into his pocket brought out  whistle  blew upon  several modulated blasts  rang far across  heated air i could not tell  course  meaning   signal but  instantly awoke my fears more men would  coming i might  discovered they had already slain two   honest people after tom  alan might not i come next instantly i began  extricate myself  crawl back again  what speed  silence i could manage   more open portion   wood as i did so i could hear hails coming  going between  old buccaneer  his comrades  this sound  danger lent me wings as soon  i  clear   thicket i ran  i never ran before scarce minding  direction  my flight so long   led me   murderers   i ran fear grew  grew upon me until  turned into  kind  frenzy indeed could anyone  more entirely lost than i when  gun fired how should i dare  go down   boats among those fiends still smoking  their crime would not  first  them who saw me wring my neck like  snipe’s would not my absence itself   evidence  them  my alarm  therefore  my fatal knowledge it  all over i thought goodbye   hispaniola goodbye   squire  doctor   captain there  nothing left  me but death  starvation or death   hands   mutineers all this while  i say i  still running  without taking any notice i had drawn near   foot   little hill   two peaks  had got into  part   island where  liveoaks grew more widely apart  seemed more like forest trees  their bearing  dimensions mingled  these   few scattered pines some fifty some nearer seventy feet high the air too smelt more freshly than down beside  marsh and here  fresh alarm brought me   standstill   thumping heart  the man   island from  side   hill which  here steep  stony  spout  gravel  dislodged  fell rattling  bounding through  trees my eyes turned instinctively   direction  i saw  figure leap  great rapidity behind  trunk   pine what  was whether bear or man or monkey i could  no wise tell it seemed dark  shaggy more i knew not but  terror  this new apparition brought me   stand i  now  seemed cut off upon both sides behind me  murderers before me this lurking nondescript and immediately i began  prefer  dangers  i knew  those i knew not silver himself appeared less terrible  contrast  this creature   woods  i turned  my heel  looking sharply behind me over my shoulder began  retrace my steps   direction   boats instantly  figure reappeared  making  wide circuit began  head me off i  tired  any rate but had i been  fresh  when i rose i could see    vain  me  contend  speed  such  adversary from trunk  trunk  creature flitted like  deer running manlike  two legs but unlike any man  i had ever seen stooping almost double   ran yet  man  was i could no longer   doubt about that i began  recall what i had heard  cannibals i  within  ace  calling  help but  mere fact     man however wild had somewhat reassured me  my fear  silver began  revive  proportion i stood still therefore  cast about  some method  escape   i  so thinking  recollection  my pistol flashed into my mind as soon  i remembered i  not defenceless courage glowed again  my heart  i set my face resolutely  this man   island  walked briskly towards him he  concealed  this time behind another tree trunk but  must have been watching me closely   soon  i began  move  his direction  reappeared  took  step  meet me then  hesitated drew back came forward again   last  my wonder  confusion threw himself  his knees  held out his clasped hands  supplication at  i once more stopped “who  you” i asked “ben gunn”  answered  his voice sounded hoarse  awkward like  rusty lock “i’m poor ben gunn i am  i haven’t spoke   christian these three years” i could now see     white man like myself   his features  even pleasing his skin wherever   exposed  burnt   sun even his lips  black  his fair eyes looked quite startling  so dark  face of all  beggarmen  i had seen or fancied    chief  raggedness he  clothed  tatters  old ship’s canvas  old seacloth  this extraordinary patchwork  all held together   system   most various  incongruous fastenings brass buttons bits  stick  loops  tarry gaskin about his waist  wore  old brassbuckled leather belt which   one thing solid  his whole accoutrement “three years” i cried “were you shipwrecked” “nay mate” said he “marooned” i had heard  word  i knew  stood   horrible kind  punishment common enough among  buccaneers  which  offender  put ashore   little powder  shot  left behind  some desolate  distant island “marooned three years agone”  continued “and lived  goats since then  berries  oysters wherever  man is says i  man can do  himself but mate my heart  sore  christian diet you mightn’t happen  have  piece  cheese about you now no well many’s  long night i’ve dreamed  cheesetoasted mostlyand woke up again  here i were” “if ever i can get aboard again” said i “you shall have cheese   stone” all this time  had been feeling  stuff  my jacket smoothing my hands looking  my boots  generally   intervals  his speech showing  childish pleasure   presence   fellow creature but  my last words  perked up into  kind  startled slyness “if ever you can get aboard again says you”  repeated “why now who’s  hinder you” “not you i know”  my reply “and right you was”  cried “now youwhat do you call yourself mate” “jim” i told him “jim jim” says he quite pleased apparently “well now jim i’ve lived  rough  you’d  ashamed  hear of now  instance you wouldn’t think i had had  pious motherto look  me”  asked “why no not  particular” i answered “ah well” said he “but i hadremarkable pious and i   civil pious boy  could rattle off my catechism  fast  you couldn’t tell one word  another and here’s what  come to jim   begun  chuckfarthen   blessed gravestones that’s what  begun with but  went further’n that  so my mother told me  predicked  whole she did  pious woman but   providence  put me here i’ve thought  all out  this here lonely island  i’m back  piety you don’t catch me tasting rum so much but just  thimbleful  luck  course  first chance i have i’m bound i’ll  good  i see  way to and jim”looking all round him  lowering his voice   whisper“i’m rich” i now felt sure   poor fellow had gone crazy  his solitude  i suppose i must have shown  feeling  my face   repeated  statement hotly “rich rich i says and i’ll tell you what i’ll make  man  you jim ah jim you’ll bless your stars you will you   first  found me” and  this there came suddenly  lowering shadow over his face   tightened his grasp upon my hand  raised  forefinger threateningly before my eyes “now jim you tell me true  ain’t flint’s ship”  asked at this i had  happy inspiration i began  believe  i had found  ally  i answered him  once “it’s not flint’s ship  flint  dead but i’ll tell you true  you ask methere  some  flint’s hands aboard worse luck   rest  us” “not  manwith oneleg”  gasped “silver” i asked “ah silver” says he “that  his name” “he’s  cook   ringleader too” he  still holding me   wrist     give  quite  wring “if you  sent  long john”  said “i’m  good  pork  i know it but where  you do you suppose” i had made my mind up   moment   way  answer told him  whole story  our voyage   predicament  which we found ourselves he heard me   keenest interest  when i had done  patted me   head “you’re  good lad jim”  said “and you’re all   clove hitch ain’t you well you just put your trust  ben gunnben gunn’s  man  do it would you think  likely now  your squire would prove  liberalminded one  case  helphim being   clove hitch  you remark” i told him  squire   most liberal  men “aye but you see” returned ben gunn “i didn’t mean giving me  gate  keep   suit  livery clothes  such that’s not my mark jim what i mean is would   likely  come down   toon of say one thousand pounds out  money that’s  good   man’s own already” “i am sure  would” said i “as  was all hands   share” “and  passage home”  added   look  great shrewdness “why” i cried “the squire’s  gentleman and besides if we got rid   others we should want you  help work  vessel home” “ah” said he “so you would” and  seemed very much relieved “now i’ll tell you what”  went on “so much i’ll tell you  no more i   flint’s ship when  buried  treasure   six alongsix strong

long john   quartermaster  they asked him where  treasure was ‘ah’ says he ‘you can go ashore if you like  stay’  says ‘but    ship she’ll beat up  more  thunder’ that’s what  said “well i   another ship three years back  we sighted this island ‘boys’ said i ‘here’s flint’s treasure let’s land  find it’ the cap’n  displeased  that but my messmates  all   mind  landed twelve days they looked  it  every day they had  worse word  me until one fine morning all hands went aboard ‘as  you benjamin gunn’ says they ‘here’s  musket’ they says ‘and  spade  pickaxe you can stay here  find flint’s money  yourself’ they says “well jim three years have i been here  not  bite  christian diet   day  this but now you look here look  me do i look like  man before  mast no says you nor i weren’t neither i

more confidencea precious sight mind thatin  gen’leman born than  these gen’leman  fortune having been one hisself” “well” i said “i don’t understand one word  you’ve been saying but that’s neither here nor there  how am i  get  board” “ah” said he “that’s  hitch  sure well there’s my boat  i made  my two hands i keep her under  white rock if  worst come   worst we might try  after dark hi”  broke out “what’s that” for just then although  sun had still  hour or two  run all  echoes   island awoke  bellowed   thunder   cannon “they have begun  fight” i cried “follow me” and i began  run towards  anchorage my terrors all forgotten while close  my side  marooned man  his goatskins trotted easily  lightly “left left” says he “keep  your left hand mate jim under  trees  you theer’s where i killed my first goat they don’t come down here now they’re all mastheaded  them mountings   fear  benjamin gunn ah and there’s  cetemery”cemetery  must have meant “you see  mounds i come here  prayed nows  thens when i thought maybe  sunday would  about doo it weren’t quite  chapel but  seemed more solemn like  then says you ben gunn  shorthandedno chapling nor so much   bible   flag you says” so  kept talking  i ran neither expecting nor receiving any answer the cannonshot  followed after  considerable interval   volley  small arms another pause  then not  quarter   mile  front  me i beheld  union jack flutter   air above  wood part fourthe stockade  narrative continued   doctor how  ship was abandoned it  about half past onethree bells   sea phrasethat  two boats went ashore   hispaniola the captain  squire  i  talking matters over   cabin had there been  breath  wind we should have fallen   six mutineers who  left aboard  us slipped our cable  away  sea but  wind  wanting   complete our helplessness down came hunter   news  jim hawkins had slipped into  boat   gone ashore   rest it never occurred  us  doubt jim hawkins but we  alarmed  his safety with  men   temper they  in  seemed  even chance if we should see  lad again we ran  deck the pitch  bubbling   seams  nasty stench   place turned me sick if ever  man smelt fever  dysentery     abominable anchorage the six scoundrels  sitting grumbling under  sail   forecastle ashore we could see  gigs made fast   man sitting  each hard  where  river runs in one  them  whistling “lillibullero” waiting   strain    decided  hunter  i should go ashore   jollyboat  quest  information the gigs had leaned  their right but hunter  i pulled straight in   direction   stockade upon  chart the two who  left guarding their boats seemed   bustle  our appearance “lillibullero” stopped off  i could see  pair discussing what they ought  do had they gone  told silver all might have turned out differently but they had their orders i suppose  decided  sit quietly where they   hark back again  “lillibullero” there   slight bend   coast  i steered so   put  between us even before we landed we had thus lost sight   gigs i jumped out  came  near running  i durst   big silk handkerchief under my hat  coolness’ sake   brace  pistols ready primed  safety i had not gone  hundred yards when i reached  stockade this  how  was  spring  clear water rose almost   top   knoll well   knoll  enclosing  spring they had clapped  stout loghouse fit  hold two score  people   pinch  loopholed  musketry  either side all round

had them  every way they stood quiet  shelter  shot  others like partridges all they wanted   good watch  food for short   complete surprise they might have held  place against  regiment what particularly took my fancy   spring for though we had  good enough place     cabin   hispaniola  plenty  arms  ammunition  things  eat  excellent wines there had been one thing overlookedwe had no water i  thinking this over when there came ringing over  island  cry   man   point  death i  not new  violent deathi have served his royal highness  duke  cumberland  got  wound myself  fontenoybut i know my pulse went dot  carry one “jim hawkins  gone”  my first thought it  something  have been  old soldier but more still  have been  doctor there  no time  dillydally  our work and so now i made up my mind instantly   no time lost returned   shore  jumped  board  jollyboat by good fortune hunter pulled  good oar we made  water fly   boat  soon alongside  i aboard  schooner i found them all shaken   natural the squire  sitting down  white   sheet thinking   harm  had led us to  good soul and one   six forecastle hands  little better “there’s  man” says captain smollett nodding towards him “new  this work he came nighhand fainting doctor when  heard  cry another touch   rudder   man would join us” i told my plan   captain  between us we settled   details   accomplishment we put old redruth   gallery between  cabin   forecastle  three or four loaded muskets   mattress  protection hunter brought  boat round under  sternport  joyce  i set  work loading her  powder tins muskets bags  biscuits kegs  pork  cask  cognac  my invaluable medicine chest in  meantime  squire   captain stayed  deck   latter hailed  coxswain who   principal man aboard “mr hands”  said “here  two  us   brace  pistols each if any one  you six make  signal  any description  man’s dead” they   good deal taken aback  after  little consultation one  all tumbled down  fore companion thinking no doubt  take us   rear but when they saw redruth waiting  them   sparred galley they went about ship  once   head popped out again  deck “down dog” cries  captain and  head popped back again  we heard no more   time  these six very fainthearted seamen by this time tumbling things   they came we had  jollyboat loaded  much  we dared joyce  i got out through  sternport  we made  shore again  fast  oars could take us this second trip fairly aroused  watchers along shore “lillibullero”  dropped again  just before we lost sight  them behind  little point one  them whipped ashore  disappeared i had half  mind  change my plan  destroy their boats but i feared  silver   others might  close  hand  all might very well  lost  trying  too much we had soon touched land   same place  before  set  provision  block house all three made  first journey heavily laden  tossed our stores over  palisade then leaving joyce  guard themone man   sure but  half  dozen musketshunter  i returned   jollyboat  loaded ourselves once more so we proceeded without pausing  take breath till  whole cargo  bestowed when  two servants took up their position   block house  i  all my power sculled back   hispaniola that we should have risked  second boat load seems more daring than  really was they had  advantage  numbers  course but we had  advantage  arms not one   men ashore had  musket  before they could get within range  pistol shooting we flattered ourselves we should  able  give  good account   halfdozen  least the squire  waiting  me   stern window all his faintness gone  him he caught  painter  made  fast  we fell  loading  boat  our very lives pork powder  biscuit   cargo  only  musket   cutlass apiece   squire  me  redruth   captain the rest   arms  powder we dropped overboard  two fathoms   half  water so  we could see  bright steel shining far below us   sun   clean sandy bottom by this time  tide  beginning  ebb   ship  swinging round  her anchor voices  heard faintly halloaing   direction   two gigs  though this reassured us  joyce  hunter who  well   eastward  warned our party   off redruth retreated  his place   gallery  dropped into  boat which we then brought round   ship’s counter   handier  captain smollett “now men” said he “do you hear me” there  no answer   forecastle “it’s  you abraham grayit’s  you i am speaking” still no reply “gray” resumed mr smollett  little louder “i am leaving this ship  i order you  follow your captain i know you   good man  bottom  i dare say not one   lot  you’s  bad   makes out i have my watch here  my hand i give you thirty seconds  join me in” there   pause “come my fine fellow” continued  captain “don’t hang so long  stays i’m risking my life   lives  these good gentlemen every second” there   sudden scuffle  sound  blows  out burst abraham gray   knife cut   side   cheek  came running   captain like  dog   whistle “i’m  you sir” said he and  next moment    captain had dropped aboard  us  we had shoved off  given way we  clear out   ship but not yet ashore  our stockade  narrative continued   doctor the jollyboat’s last trip this fifth trip  quite different  any   others in  first place  little gallipot   boat  we    gravely overloaded five grown men  three  themtrelawney redruth   captainover six feet high  already more than she  meant  carry add    powder pork  breadbags the gunwale  lipping astern several times we shipped  little water  my breeches   tails  my coat  all soaking wet before we had gone  hundred yards the captain made us trim  boat  we got her  lie  little more evenly all  same we  afraid  breathe in  second place  ebb  now makinga strong rippling current running westward through  basin  then south’ard  seaward down  straits  which we had entered   morning even  ripples   danger  our overloaded craft but  worst     we  swept out  our true course  away  our proper landingplace behind  point if we let  current have  way we should come ashore beside  gigs where  pirates might appear  any moment “i cannot keep her head   stockade sir” said i   captain i  steering while   redruth two fresh men    oars “the tide keeps washing her down could you pull  little stronger” “not without swamping  boat” said he “you must bear up sir if you pleasebear up until you see you’re gaining” i tried  found  experiment   tide kept sweeping us westward until i had laid her head due east or just about right angles   way we ought  go “we’ll never get ashore  this rate” said i “if it’s  only course  we can lie sir we must even lie it” returned  captain “we must keep upstream you see sir”  went on “if once we dropped  leeward   landingplace it’s hard  say where we should get ashore besides  chance  being boarded   gigs whereas  way we go  current must slacken  then we can dodge back along  shore” “the current’s less a’ready sir” said  man gray who  sitting   foresheets “you can ease her off  bit” “thank you my man” said i quite  if nothing had happened  we had all quietly made up our minds  treat him like one  ourselves suddenly  captain spoke up again  i thought his voice   little changed “the gun” said he “i have thought  that” said i  i made sure   thinking   bombardment   fort “they could never get  gun ashore  if they did they could never haul  through  woods” “look astern doctor” replied  captain we had entirely forgotten  long nine  there  our horror   five rogues busy about her getting off her jacket  they called  stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed not only that but  flashed into my mind   same moment   roundshot   powder   gun had been left behind   stroke   axe would put  all into  possession   evil ones abroad “israel  flint’s gunner” said gray hoarsely at any risk we put  boat’s head direct   landingplace by this time we had got so far out   run   current  we kept steerage way even  our necessarily gentle rate  rowing  i could keep her steady   goal but  worst       course i now held we turned our broadside instead  our stern   hispaniola  offered  target like  barn door i could hear  well  see  brandyfaced rascal israel hands plumping down  roundshot   deck “who’s  best shot” asked  captain “mr trelawney out  away” said i “mr trelawney  you please pick me off one  these men sir hands if possible” said  captain trelawney   cool  steel he looked   priming  his gun “now” cried  captain “easy   gun sir or you’ll swamp  boat all hands stand   trim her when  aims” the squire raised his gun  rowing ceased  we leaned over   other side  keep  balance  all  so nicely contrived  we did not ship  drop they had  gun  this time slewed round upon  swivel  hands who    muzzle   rammer   consequence  most exposed however we had no luck  just  trelawney fired down  stooped  ball whistled over him    one   other four who fell the cry  gave  echoed not only  his companions  board but   great number  voices   shore  looking   direction i saw  other pirates trooping out  among  trees  tumbling into their places   boats “here come  gigs sir” said i “give way then” cried  captain “we mustn’t mind if we swamp her now if we can’t get ashore all’s up” “only one   gigs  being manned sir” i added “the crew   other most likely going round  shore  cut us off” “they’ll have  hot run sir” returned  captain “jack ashore you know it’s not them i mind it’s  roundshot carpet bowls my lady’s maid couldn’t miss tell us squire when you see  match  we’ll hold water” in  meanwhile we had been making headway   good pace   boat so overloaded  we had shipped but little water   process we  now close in thirty or forty strokes  we should beach her   ebb had already disclosed  narrow belt  sand below  clustering trees the gig  no longer   feared  little point had already concealed   our eyes the ebbtide which had so cruelly delayed us  now making reparation  delaying our assailants the one source  danger   gun “if i durst” said  captain “i’d stop  pick off another man” but   plain  they meant nothing should delay their shot they had never so much  looked  their fallen comrade though   not dead  i could see him trying  crawl away “ready” cried  squire “hold” cried  captain quick   echo and   redruth backed   great heave  sent her stern bodily under water the report fell    same instant  time this   first  jim heard  sound   squire’s shot not having reached him where  ball passed not one  us precisely knew but i fancy  must have been over our heads    wind   may have contributed  our disaster at any rate  boat sank   stern quite gently  three feet  water leaving  captain  myself facing each other  our feet the other three took complete headers  came up again drenched  bubbling so far there  no great harm no lives  lost  we could wade ashore  safety but there  all our stores   bottom   make things worse only two guns out  five remained   state  service mine i had snatched  my knees  held over my head   sort  instinct as   captain  had carried his over his shoulder   bandoleer  like  wise man lock uppermost the other three had gone down   boat to add  our concern we heard voices already drawing near us   woods along shore  we had not only  danger  being cut off   stockade  our halfcrippled state but  fear before us whether if hunter  joyce  attacked  half  dozen they would have  sense  conduct  stand firm hunter  steady  we knew joyce   doubtful casea pleasant polite man   valet   brush one’s clothes but not entirely fitted   man  war with all this  our minds we waded ashore  fast  we could leaving behind us  poor jollyboat   good half  all our powder  provisions  narrative continued   doctor end   first day’s fighting we made our best speed across  strip  wood  now divided us   stockade   every step we took  voices   buccaneers rang nearer soon we could hear their footfalls  they ran   cracking   branches  they breasted across  bit  thicket i began  see we should have  brush    earnest  looked  my priming “captain” said i “trelawney   dead shot give him your gun his own  useless” they exchanged guns  trelawney silent  cool   had been since  beginning   bustle hung  moment  his heel  see  all  fit  service at  same time observing gray   unarmed i handed him my cutlass it did all our hearts good  see him spit  his hand knit his brows  make  blade sing through  air it  plain  every line  his body  our new hand  worth his salt forty paces farther we came   edge   wood  saw  stockade  front  us we struck  enclosure about  middle   south side  almost   same time seven mutineersjob anderson  boatswain  their headappeared  full cry   southwestern corner they paused  if taken aback  before they recovered not only  squire  i but hunter  joyce   block house had time  fire the four shots came  rather  scattering volley but they did  business one   enemy actually fell   rest without hesitation turned  plunged into  trees after reloading we walked down  outside   palisade  see   fallen enemy he  stone deadshot through  heart we began  rejoice over our good success when just   moment  pistol cracked   bush  ball whistled close past my ear  poor tom redruth stumbled  fell his length   ground both  squire  i returned  shot but  we had nothing  aim at   probable we only wasted powder then we reloaded  turned our attention  poor tom the captain  gray  already examining him  i saw  half  eye  all  over i believe  readiness  our return volley had scattered  mutineers once more  we  suffered without further molestation  get  poor old gamekeeper hoisted over  stockade  carried groaning  bleeding into  loghouse poor old fellow  had not uttered one word  surprise complaint fear or even acquiescence   very beginning  our troubles till now when we had laid him down   loghouse  die he had lain like  trojan behind his mattress   gallery  had followed every order silently doggedly  well    oldest  our party   score  years  now sullen old serviceable servant       die the squire dropped down beside him  his knees  kissed his hand crying like  child “be i going doctor”  asked “tom my man” said i “you’re going home” “i wish i had had  lick  them   gun first”  replied “tom” said  squire “say you forgive me won’t you” “would   respectful like  me  you squire”   answer “howsoever so  it amen” after  little while  silence  said  thought somebody might read  prayer “it’s  custom sir”  added apologetically and not long after without another word  passed away in  meantime  captain whom i had observed   wonderfully swollen about  chest  pockets had turned out  great many various storesthe british colours  bible  coil  stoutish rope pen ink  logbook  pounds  tobacco he had found  longish firtree lying felled  trimmed   enclosure    help  hunter  had set  up   corner   loghouse where  trunks crossed  made  angle then climbing   roof  had

over came forward  another flag  reverently spread    body “don’t you take on sir”  said shaking  squire’s hand “all’s well  him no fear   hand that’s been shot down  his duty  captain  owner it

august blandly   send  find us but neither sooner nor later “you can calculate  yourself” i said “why yes” returned  captain scratching his head “and making  large allowance sir  all  gifts  providence i should say we  pretty close hauled” “how do you mean” i asked “it’s  pity sir we lost  second load that’s what i mean” replied  captain “as  powder  shot we’ll do but  rations  short very shortso short dr livesey  we’re perhaps  well without  extra mouth” and  pointed   dead body under  flag just then   roar   whistle  roundshot passed high above  roof   loghouse  plumped far beyond us

“captain” said  squire “the house  quite invisible   ship it must   flag they  aiming at would  not  wiser  take  in” “strike my colours” cried  captain “no sir not i”   soon   had said  words i think we all agreed  him for   not only  piece  stout seamanly good feeling   good policy besides  showed our enemies  we despised their cannonade all through  evening they kept thundering away ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up  sand   enclosure but they had  fire so high   shot fell dead  buried itself   soft sand we had no ricochet  fear  though one popped  through  roof   loghouse  out again through  floor we soon got used   sort  horseplay  minded  no more than cricket “there  one good thing about all this” observed  captain “the wood  front  us  likely clear the ebb  made  good while our stores should  uncovered volunteers  go  bring  pork” gray  hunter   first  come forward well armed they stole out   stockade but  proved  useless mission the mutineers  bolder than we

fate a hail   land side “somebody hailing us” said hunter who   guard “doctor squire captain hullo hunter   you” came  cries and i ran   door  time  see jim hawkins safe  sound come climbing over  stockade  narrative resumed  jim hawkins the garrison   stockade as soon  ben gunn saw  colours  came   halt stopped me   arm  sat down “now” said he “there’s your friends sure enough” “far more likely it’s  mutineers” i answered “that”  cried “why   place like this where nobody puts  but gen’lemen  fortune silver would fly  jolly roger you don’t make no doubt  that no that’s your friends

jim just wheer you found him today and him  comes   have  white thing  his hand  he’s  come alone oh and you’ll say this ‘ben gunn’ says you ‘has reasons  his own’” “well” said i “i believe i understand you have something  propose  you wish  see  squire or  doctor  you’re   found where i found you is  all” “and when says you”  added “why  about noon observation  about six bells” “good” said i “and now may i go” “you won’t forget”  inquired anxiously “precious sight  reasons  his own says you reasons  his own that’s  mainstay  between man  man well then”still holding me“i reckon you

morning” here   interrupted   loud report   cannonball came tearing through  trees  pitched   sand not  hundred yards  where we two  talking the next moment each  us had taken  his heels   different direction for  good hour  come frequent reports shook  island  balls kept crashing through  woods i moved  hidingplace  hidingplace always pursued or so  seemed  me  these terrifying missiles but towards  end   bombardment though still i durst not venture   direction   stockade where  balls fell oftenest i had begun   manner  pluck up my heart again  after  long detour   east crept down among  shoreside trees the sun had just set  sea breeze  rustling  tumbling   woods  ruffling  grey surface   anchorage  tide too  far out  great tracts  sand lay uncovered  air after  heat   day chilled me through my jacket the hispaniola still lay where she had anchored but sure enough there   jolly rogerthe black flag  piracyflying  her peak even  i looked there came another red flash  another report  sent  echoes clattering  one more roundshot whistled through  air it   last   cannonade i lay  some time watching  bustle which succeeded  attack men  demolishing something  axes   beach near  stockadethe poor jollyboat i afterwards discovered away near  mouth   river  great fire  glowing among  trees  between  point   ship one   gigs kept coming  going  men whom i had seen so gloomy shouting   oars like children but there   sound  their voices which suggested rum at length i thought i might return towards  stockade i  pretty far down   low sandy spit  encloses  anchorage   east   joined  halfwater  skeleton island  now  i rose  my feet i saw some distance further down  spit  rising  among low bushes  isolated rock pretty high  peculiarly white  colour it occurred  me  this might   white rock  which ben gunn had spoken   some day or other  boat might  wanted  i should know where  look  one then i skirted among  woods until i had regained  rear or shoreward side   stockade   soon warmly welcomed   faithful party i had soon told my story  began  look about me the loghouse  made  unsquared trunks  pineroof walls  floor the latter stood  several places  much   foot or  foot   half above  surface   sand there   porch   door  under this porch  little spring welled up into  artificial basin   rather odd kindno other than  great ship’s kettle  iron   bottom knocked out  sunk “to her bearings”   captain said among  sand little had been left besides  framework   house but  one corner there   stone slab laid down  way  hearth   old rusty iron basket  contain  fire the slopes   knoll  all  inside   stockade had been cleared  timber  build  house  we could see   stumps what  fine  lofty grove had been destroyed most   soil had been washed away or buried  drift after  removal   trees only where  streamlet ran down   kettle  thick bed  moss  some ferns  little creeping bushes  still green among  sand very close around  stockadetoo close  defence they saidthe wood still flourished high  dense all  fir   land side but towards  sea   large admixture  liveoaks the cold evening breeze  which i have spoken whistled through every chink   rude building  sprinkled  floor   continual rain  fine sand there  sand  our eyes sand  our teeth sand  our suppers sand dancing   spring   bottom   kettle  all  world like porridge beginning  boil our chimney   square hole   roof   but  little part   smoke  found  way out   rest eddied about  house  kept us coughing  piping  eye add  this  gray  new man had his face tied up   bandage   cut  had got  breaking away   mutineers   poor old tom redruth still unburied lay along  wall stiff  stark under  union jack if we had been allowed  sit idle we should all have fallen   blues but captain smollett  never  man  that all hands  called up before him   divided us into watches the doctor  gray  i  one  squire hunter  joyce upon  other tired though we all were two  sent out  firewood two more  set  dig  grave  redruth  doctor  named cook i  put sentry   door   captain himself went  one  another keeping up our spirits  lending  hand wherever   wanted from time  time  doctor came   door   little air   rest his eyes which  almost smoked out  his head  whenever  did so  had  word  me “that man smollett”  said once “is  better man than i am and when i say   means  deal jim” another time  came   silent   while then  put his head  one side  looked  me “is this ben gunn  man”  asked “i do not know sir” said i “i am not very sure whether he’s sane” “if there’s any doubt about  matter  is” returned  doctor “a man who  been three years biting his nails   desert island jim can’t expect  appear  sane  you or me it doesn’t lie  human nature was  cheese you said  had  fancy for” “yes sir cheese” i answered “well jim” says he “just see  good  comes  being dainty  your food you’ve seen my snuffbox haven’t you and you never saw me take snuff  reason being   my snuffbox i carry  piece  parmesan cheesea cheese made  italy very nutritious well that’s  ben gunn” before supper  eaten we buried old tom   sand  stood round him   while bareheaded   breeze a good deal  firewood had been got in but not enough   captain’s fancy   shook his head over   told us we “must get back  this tomorrow rather livelier” then when we had eaten our pork  each had  good stiff glass  brandy grog  three chiefs got together   corner  discuss our prospects it appears they   their wits’ end what  do  stores being so low  we must have been starved into surrender long before help came but our best hope   decided   kill off  buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away   hispaniola from nineteen they  already reduced  fifteen two others  wounded  one  leastthe man shot beside  gunseverely wounded if   not dead every time we had  crack  them we   take it saving our own lives   extremest care and besides that we had two able alliesrum   climate as   first though we  about half  mile away we could hear them roaring  singing late into  night     second  doctor staked his wig that camped where they    marsh  unprovided  remedies  half  them would   their backs before  week “so”  added “if we  not all shot down first they’ll  glad   packing   schooner it’s always  ship  they can get  buccaneering again i suppose” “first ship  ever i lost” said captain smollett i  dead tired  you may fancy  when i got  sleep which  not till after  great deal  tossing i slept like  log  wood the rest had long been up  had already breakfasted  increased  pile  firewood  about half  much again when i  wakened   bustle   sound  voices “flag  truce” i heard someone say  then immediately after   cry  surprise “silver himself” and  that up i jumped  rubbing my eyes ran   loophole   wall  silver’s embassy sure enough there  two men just outside  stockade one  them waving  white cloth  other no less  person than silver himself standing placidly by it  still quite early   coldest morning  i think i ever  abroad ina chill  pierced into  marrow the sky  bright  cloudless overhead   tops   trees shone rosily   sun but where silver stood  his lieutenant all  still  shadow  they waded kneedeep   low white vapour  had crawled during  night out   morass the chill   vapour taken together told  poor tale   island it  plainly  damp feverish unhealthy spot “keep indoors men” said  captain “ten  one this   trick” then  hailed  buccaneer “who goes stand or we fire” “flag  truce” cried silver the captain    porch keeping himself carefully out   way   treacherous shot should any  intended he turned  spoke  us “doctor’s watch   lookout dr livesey take  north side if you please jim  east gray west the watch below all hands  load muskets lively men  careful” and then  turned again   mutineers “and what do you want  your flag  truce”  cried this time    other man who replied “cap’n silver sir  come  board  make terms”  shouted “cap’n silver don’t know him who’s he” cried  captain and we could hear him adding  himself “cap’n  it my heart  here’s promotion” long john answered  himself “me sir these poor lads have chosen me cap’n after your desertion sir”laying  particular emphasis upon  word “desertion” “we’re willing  submit if we can come  terms  no bones about it all i ask  your word cap’n smollett  let me safe  sound out  this here stockade  one minute  get out o’ shot before  gun  fired” “my man” said captain smollett “i have not  slightest desire  talk  you if you wish  talk  me you can come that’s all if there’s any treachery it’ll   your side   lord help you” “that’s enough cap’n” shouted long john cheerily “a word  you’s enough i know  gentleman  you may lay  that” we could see  man who carried  flag  truce attempting  hold silver back nor   wonderful seeing how cavalier had been  captain’s answer but silver laughed  him aloud  slapped him   back  if  idea  alarm had been absurd then  advanced   stockade threw over his crutch got  leg up   great vigour  skill succeeded  surmounting  fence  dropping safely   other side i  confess  i  far too much taken up  what  going      slightest use  sentry indeed i had already deserted my eastern loophole  crept up behind  captain who had now seated himself   threshold  his elbows  his knees his head  his hands  his eyes fixed   water   bubbled out   old iron kettle   sand he  whistling “come lasses  lads” silver had terrible hard work getting up  knoll what   steepness   incline  thick tree stumps   soft sand   his crutch   helpless   ship  stays but  stuck   like  man  silence   last arrived before  captain whom  saluted   handsomest style he  tricked out  his best  immense blue coat thick  brass buttons hung  low   his knees   fine laced hat  set   back  his head “here you are my man” said  captain raising his head “you had better sit down” “you ain’t agoing  let me inside cap’n” complained long john “it’s  main cold morning   sure sir  sit outside upon  sand” “why silver” said  captain “if you had pleased    honest man you might have been sitting  your galley it’s your own doing you’re either my ship’s cookand then you  treated handsomeor cap’n silver  common mutineer  pirate  then you can go hang” “well well cap’n” returned  seacook sitting down    bidden   sand “you’ll have  give me  hand up again that’s all a sweet pretty place you have   here ah there’s jim the top   morning  you jim doctor here’s my service why there you all  together like  happy family   manner  speaking” “if you have anything  say my man better say it” said  captain “right you were cap’n smollett” replied silver “dooty  dooty   sure well now you look here    good lay  yours last night i don’t deny    good lay some  you pretty handy   handspikeend and i’ll not deny neither but what some  my people  shookmaybe all  shook maybe i  shook myself maybe that’s why i’m here  terms but you mark me cap’n  won’t do twice  thunder we’ll have  do sentrygo  ease off  point or so   rum maybe you think we  all  sheet   wind’s eye but i’ll tell you i  sober i  on’y dog tired  if i’d awoke  second sooner i’d ’a caught you   act i would he wasn’t dead when i got round  him not he” “well” says captain smollett  cool  can be all  silver said   riddle  him but you would never have guessed   his tone as  me i began  have  inkling ben gunn’s last words came back  my mind i began  suppose   had paid  buccaneers  visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire  i reckoned up  glee  we had only fourteen enemies  deal with “well here  is” said silver “we want  treasure  we’ll have itthat’s our point you would just  soon save your lives i reckon  that’s yours you have  chart haven’t you” “that’s  may be” replied  captain “oh well you have i know that” returned long john “you needn’t  so husky   man there ain’t  particle  service  that  you may lay  it what i mean is we want your chart now i never meant you no harm myself” “that won’t do  me my man” interrupted  captain “we know exactly what you meant  do  we don’t care  now you see you can’t do it” and  captain looked  him calmly  proceeded  fill  pipe “if abe gray” silver broke out “avast there” cried mr smollett “gray told me nothing  i asked him nothing  what’s more i would see you  him  this whole island blown clean out   water into blazes first so there’s my mind  you my man  that” this little whiff  temper seemed  cool silver down he had been growing nettled before but now  pulled himself together “like enough” said he “i would set no limits  what gentlemen might consider shipshape or might not   case were and seein’  how you  about  take  pipe cap’n i’ll make so free  do likewise” and  filled  pipe  lighted it   two men sat silently smoking  quite  while now looking each other   face now stopping their tobacco now leaning forward  spit it   good   play  see them “now” resumed silver “here  is you give us  chart  get  treasure by  drop shooting poor seamen  stoving  their heads  while asleep you do that  we’ll offer you  choice either you come aboard along  us once  treasure shipped  then i’ll give you my affydavy upon my word  honour  clap you somewhere safe ashore or if  ain’t  your fancy some  my hands being rough  having old scores  account  hazing then you can stay here you can we’ll divide stores  you man  man  i’ll give my affydavy  before  speak  first ship i sight  send ’em here  pick you up now you’ll own that’s talking handsomer you couldn’t look  get now you and i hope”raising his voice“that all hands  this here block house  overhaul my words  what  spoke  one  spoke  all” captain smollett rose  his seat  knocked out  ashes  his pipe   palm  his left hand “is  all”  asked “every last word  thunder” answered john “refuse that  you’ve seen  last  me but musketballs” “very good” said  captain “now you’ll hear me if you’ll come up one  one unarmed i’ll engage  clap you all  irons  take you home   fair trial  england if you won’t my name  alexander smollett i’ve flown my sovereign’s colours  i’ll see you all  davy jones you can’t find  treasure you can’t sail  shipthere’s not  man among you fit  sail  ship you can’t fight usgray there got away  five  you your ship’s  irons master silver you’re   lee shore  so you’ll find i stand here  tell you so  they’re  last good words you’ll get  me    name  heaven i’ll put  bullet  your back when next i meet you tramp my lad bundle out  this please hand over hand  double quick” silver’s face   picture his eyes started  his head  wrath he shook  fire out  his pipe “give me  hand up”  cried “not i” returned  captain “who’ll give me  hand up”  roared not  man among us moved growling  foulest imprecations  crawled along  sand till  got hold   porch  could hoist himself again upon his crutch then  spat into  spring “there”  cried “that’s what i think  ye before  hour’s out i’ll stove  your old block house like  rum puncheon laugh  thunder laugh before  hour’s out ye’ll laugh upon  other side them  die’ll   lucky ones” and   dreadful oath  stumbled off ploughed down  sand  helped across  stockade after four or five failures   man   flag  truce  disappeared   instant afterwards among  trees  the attack as soon  silver disappeared  captain who had been closely watching him turned towards  interior   house  found not  man  us  his post but gray it   first time we had ever seen him angry “quarters”  roared and then  we all slunk back  our places “gray”  said “i’ll put your name   log you’ve stood  your duty like  seaman mr trelawney i’m surprised  you sir doctor i thought you had worn  king’s coat if   how you served  fontenoy sir you’d have been better  your berth” the doctor’s watch  all back  their loopholes  rest  busy loading  spare muskets  everyone   red face you may  certain   flea  his ear   saying is the captain looked    while  silence then  spoke “my lads” said he “i’ve given silver  broadside i pitched   redhot  purpose  before  hour’s out   said we shall  boarded we’re outnumbered i needn’t tell you that but we fight  shelter   minute ago i should have said we fought  discipline i’ve no manner  doubt  we can drub them if you choose” then  went  rounds  saw   said  all  clear on  two short sides   house east  west there  only two loopholes   south side where  porch was two again    north side five there   round score  muskets   seven  us  firewood had been built into four pilestables you might sayone about  middle  each side   each  these tables some ammunition  four loaded muskets  laid ready   hand   defenders in  middle  cutlasses lay ranged “toss out  fire” said  captain “the chill  past  we mustn’t have smoke  our eyes” the iron firebasket  carried bodily out  mr trelawney   embers smothered among sand “hawkins hasn’t had his breakfast hawkins help yourself  back  your post  eat it” continued captain smollett “lively now my lad you’ll want  before you’ve done hunter serve out  round  brandy  all hands” and while this  going on  captain completed  his own mind  plan   defence “doctor you  take  door”  resumed “see  don’t expose yourself keep within  fire through  porch hunter take  east side there joyce you stand   west my man mr trelawney you   best shotyou  gray  take this long north side   five loopholes it’s there  danger is if they can get up    fire  upon us through our own ports things would begin  look dirty hawkins neither you nor i  much account   shooting we’ll stand   load  bear  hand” as  captain had said  chill  past as soon   sun had climbed above our girdle  trees  fell  all  force upon  clearing  drank up  vapours   draught soon  sand  baking   resin melting   logs   block house jackets  coats  flung aside shirts thrown open   neck  rolled up   shoulders  we stood there each  his post   fever  heat  anxiety an hour passed away “hang them” said  captain “this   dull   doldrums gray whistle   wind” and just   moment came  first news   attack “if you please sir” said joyce “if i see anyone am i  fire” “i told you so” cried  captain “thank you sir” returned joyce   same quiet civility nothing followed   time but  remark had set us all   alert straining ears  eyesthe musketeers  their pieces balanced  their hands  captain out   middle   block house  his mouth very tight   frown  his face so some seconds passed till suddenly joyce whipped up his musket  fired the report had scarcely died away ere   repeated  repeated  without   scattering volley shot behind shot like  string  geese  every side   enclosure several bullets struck  loghouse but not one entered    smoke cleared away  vanished  stockade   woods around  looked  quiet  empty  before not  bough waved not  gleam   musketbarrel betrayed  presence  our foes “did you hit your man” asked  captain “no sir” replied joyce “i believe not sir” “next best thing  tell  truth” muttered captain smollett “load his gun hawkins how many should say there   your side doctor” “i know precisely” said dr livesey “three shots  fired  this side i saw  three flashestwo close togetherone farther   west” “three” repeated  captain “and how many  yours mr trelawney” but this  not so easily answered there had come many   northseven   squire’s computation eight or nine according  gray from  east  west only  single shot had been fired it  plain therefore   attack would  developed   north     other three sides we  only   annoyed   show  hostilities but captain smollett made no change  his arrangements if  mutineers succeeded  crossing  stockade  argued they would take possession  any unprotected loophole  shoot us down like rats  our own stronghold nor had we much time left  us  thought suddenly   loud huzza  little cloud  pirates leaped   woods   north side  ran straight   stockade at  same moment  fire  once more opened   woods   rifle ball sang through  doorway  knocked  doctor’s musket into bits the boarders swarmed over  fence like monkeys squire  gray fired again  yet again three men fell one forwards into  enclosure two back   outside but  these one  evidently more frightened than hurt     his feet again   crack  instantly disappeared among  trees two had bit  dust one had fled four had made good their footing inside our defences while   shelter   woods seven or eight men each evidently supplied  several muskets kept up  hot though useless fire   loghouse the four who had boarded made straight before them   building shouting  they ran   men among  trees shouted back  encourage them several shots  fired but such   hurry   marksmen  not one appears  have taken effect in  moment  four pirates had swarmed up  mound   upon us the head  job anderson  boatswain appeared   middle loophole “at ’em all handsall hands”  roared   voice  thunder at  same moment another pirate grasped hunter’s musket   muzzle wrenched   his hands plucked  through  loophole   one stunning blow laid  poor fellow senseless   floor meanwhile  third running unharmed all around  house appeared suddenly   doorway  fell  his cutlass   doctor our position  utterly reversed a moment since we  firing under cover   exposed enemy now   we who lay uncovered  could not return  blow the loghouse  full  smoke  which we owed our comparative safety cries  confusion  flashes  reports  pistolshots  one loud groan rang  my ears “out lads out  fight ’em   open cutlasses” cried  captain i snatched  cutlass   pile  someone   same time snatching another gave me  cut across  knuckles which i hardly felt i dashed out   door into  clear sunlight someone  close behind i knew not whom right  front  doctor  pursuing his assailant down  hill  just  my eyes fell upon him beat down his guard  sent him sprawling  his back   great slash across  face “round  house lads round  house” cried  captain  even   hurlyburly i perceived  change  his voice mechanically i obeyed turned eastwards   my cutlass raised ran round  corner   house next moment i  face  face  anderson he roared aloud  his hanger went up above his head flashing   sunlight i had not time   afraid but   blow still hung impending leaped   trice upon one side  missing my foot   soft sand rolled headlong down  slope when i had first sallied   door  other mutineers had been already swarming up  palisade  make  end  us one man   red nightcap  his cutlass  his mouth had even got upon  top  thrown  leg across well so short had been  interval  when i found my feet again all    same posture  fellow   red nightcap still halfway over another still just showing his head above  top   stockade and yet  this breath  time  fight  over   victory  ours gray following close behind me had cut down  big boatswain ere  had time  recover  his last blow another had been shot   loophole   very act  firing into  house  now lay  agony  pistol still smoking  his hand a third  i had seen  doctor had disposed    blow of  four who had scaled  palisade one only remained unaccounted for  he having left his cutlass   field  now clambering out again   fear  death upon him “firefire   house” cried  doctor “and you lads back into cover” but his words  unheeded no shot  fired   last boarder made good his escape  disappeared   rest into  wood in three seconds nothing remained   attacking party but  five who had fallen four   inside  one   outside   palisade the doctor  gray  i ran full speed  shelter the survivors would soon  back where they had left their muskets   any moment  fire might recommence the house   this time somewhat cleared  smoke  we saw   glance  price we had paid  victory hunter lay beside his loophole stunned joyce  his shot through  head never  move again while right   centre  squire  supporting  captain one  pale   other “the captain’s wounded” said mr trelawney “have they run” asked mr smollett “all  could you may  bound” returned  doctor “but there’s five  them  never run again” “five” cried  captain “come that’s better five against three leaves us four  nine that’s better odds than we had  starting we  seven  nineteen then or thought we were  that’s  bad  bear”  the mutineers  soon only eight  number   man shot  mr trelawney  board  schooner died  same evening  his wound but this was  course not known till after   faithful party part fivemy sea adventure  how my sea adventure began there  no return   mutineersnot so much  another shot out   woods they had “got their rations   day”   captain put it  we

bargain after dinner  squire   doctor sat   captain’s side awhile  consultation  when they had talked  their hearts’ content  being then  little past noon  doctor took up his hat  pistols girt   cutlass put  chart  his pocket    musket over his shoulder crossed  palisade   north side  set off briskly through  trees gray  i  sitting together   far end   block house   out  earshot  our officers consulting  gray took his pipe out  his mouth  fairly forgot  put  back again so thunderstruck    this occurrence “why   name  davy jones” said he “is dr livesey mad” “why no” says i “he’s about  last  this crew  that i take it” “well shipmate” said gray “mad  may not be but if he’s not you mark my words i am” “i take it” replied i “the doctor  his idea  if i am right he’s going now  see ben gunn” i  right  appeared later but   meantime  house being stifling hot   little patch  sand inside  palisade ablaze  midday sun i began  get another thought into my head which  not  any means so right what i began  do   envy  doctor walking   cool shadow   woods   birds about him   pleasant smell   pines while i sat grilling  my clothes stuck   hot resin  so much blood about me  so many poor dead bodies lying all around  i took  disgust   place   almost  strong  fear all  time i  washing out  block house  then washing up  things  dinner this disgust  envy kept growing stronger  stronger till  last being near  breadbag  no one then observing me i took  first step towards my escapade  filled both pockets  my coat  biscuit i   fool if you like  certainly i  going  do  foolish overbold act but i  determined  do   all  precautions  my power these biscuits should anything befall me would keep me  least  starving till far    next day the next thing i laid hold    brace  pistols   i already had  powderhorn  bullets i felt myself well supplied  arms as   scheme i had  my head   not  bad one  itself i   go down  sandy spit  divides  anchorage   east   open sea find  white rock i had observed last evening  ascertain whether   there or not  ben gunn had hidden his boat  thing quite worth doing  i still believe but  i  certain i should not  allowed  leave  enclosure my only plan   take french leave  slip out when nobody  watching    so bad  way  doing   made  thing itself wrong but i  only  boy  i had made my mind up well  things  last fell out i found  admirable opportunity the squire  gray  busy helping  captain  his bandages  coast  clear i made  bolt   over  stockade  into  thickest   trees  before my absence  observed i  out  cry  my companions this  my second folly far worse than  first  i left but two sound men  guard  house but like  first    help towards saving all  us i took my way straight   east coast   island  i  determined  go down  sea side   spit  avoid all chance  observation   anchorage it  already late   afternoon although still warm  sunny as i continued  thread  tall woods i could hear  far before me not only  continuous thunder   surf but  certain tossing  foliage  grinding  boughs which showed me  sea breeze had set  higher than usual soon cool draughts  air began  reach me   few steps farther i came forth into  open borders   grove  saw  sea lying blue  sunny   horizon   surf tumbling  tossing  foam along  beach i have never seen  sea quiet round treasure island the sun might blaze overhead  air  without  breath  surface smooth  blue but still these great rollers would  running along all  external coast thundering  thundering  day  night  i scarce believe there  one spot   island where  man would  out  earshot  their noise i walked along beside  surf  great enjoyment till thinking i  now got far enough   south i took  cover  some thick bushes  crept warily up   ridge   spit behind me   sea  front  anchorage the sea breeze  though  had  sooner blown itself out   unusual violence  already   end  had been succeeded  light variable airs   south  southeast carrying great banks  fog   anchorage under lee  skeleton island lay still  leaden  when first we entered it the hispaniola   unbroken mirror  exactly portrayed   truck   waterline  jolly roger hanging  her peak alongside lay one   gigs silver   sternsheetshim i could

distanceupwards   milei could  course hear no word  what  said all  once there began  most horrid unearthly screaming which  first startled me badly though i had soon remembered  voice  captain flint  even thought i could make out  bird  her bright plumage  she sat perched upon her master’s wrist soon after  jollyboat shoved off  pulled  shore   man   red cap  his comrade went below   cabin companion just about  same time  sun had gone down behind  spyglass    fog  collecting rapidly  began  grow dark  earnest i saw i must lose no time if i   find  boat  evening the white rock visible enough above  brush  still some eighth   mile further down  spit   took me  goodish while  get up  it crawling often  all fours among  scrub night had almost come when i laid my hand   rough sides right below  there   exceedingly small hollow  green turf hidden  banks   thick underwood about kneedeep  grew there very plentifully    centre   dell sure enough  little tent  goatskins like what  gipsies carry about  them  england i dropped into  hollow lifted  side   tent  there  ben gunn’s boathomemade if ever anything  homemade  rude lopsided framework  tough wood  stretched upon   covering  goatskin   hair inside the thing  extremely small even  me  i can hardly imagine   could have floated   fullsized man there  one thwart set  low  possible  kind  stretcher   bows   double paddle  propulsion i had not then seen  coracle such   ancient britons made but i have seen one since  i can give you no fairer idea  ben gunn’s boat than  saying   like  first   worst coracle ever made  man but  great advantage   coracle  certainly possessed    exceedingly light  portable well now  i had found  boat you would have thought i had had enough  truantry  once but   meantime i had taken another notion  become so obstinately fond    i would have carried  out i believe   teeth  captain smollett himself this   slip out under cover   night cut  hispaniola adrift  let her go ashore where she fancied i had quite made up my mind   mutineers after their repulse   morning had nothing nearer their hearts than  up anchor  away  sea this i thought  would   fine thing  prevent  now  i had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided   boat i thought  might  done  little risk down i sat  wait  darkness  made  hearty meal  biscuit it   night out  ten thousand  my purpose the fog had now buried all heaven as  last rays  daylight dwindled  disappeared absolute blackness settled down  treasure island and when  last i shouldered  coracle  groped my way stumblingly out   hollow where i had supped there  but two points visible   whole anchorage one   great fire  shore  which  defeated pirates lay carousing   swamp the other  mere blur  light upon  darkness indicated  position   anchored ship she had swung round   ebbher bow  now towards methe only lights  board    cabin  what i saw  merely  reflection   fog   strong rays  flowed   stern window the ebb had already run some time  i had  wade through  long belt  swampy sand where i sank several times above  ankle before i came   edge   retreating water  wading  little way in  some strength  dexterity set my coracle keel downwards   surface  the ebbtide runs the coracleas i had ample reason  know before i  done  herwas  very safe boat   person  my height  weight both buoyant  clever   seaway but she   most crossgrained lopsided craft  manage do  you pleased she always made more leeway than anything else  turning round  round   manoeuvre she  best at even ben gunn himself  admitted  she  “queer  handle till you knew her way” certainly i did not know her way she turned  every direction but  one i  bound  go  most part   time we  broadside on  i am very sure i never should have made  ship  all but   tide by good fortune paddle  i pleased  tide  still sweeping me down  there lay  hispaniola right   fairway hardly   missed first she loomed before me like  blot  something yet blacker than darkness then her spars  hull began  take shape   next moment   seemed for  farther i went  brisker grew  current   ebb i  alongside  her hawser  had laid hold the hawser   taut   bowstring   current so strong she pulled upon her anchor all round  hull   blackness  rippling current bubbled  chattered like  little mountain stream one cut  my seagully   hispaniola would go humming down  tide so far so good but  next occurred  my recollection   taut hawser suddenly cut   thing  dangerous   kicking horse ten  one if i  so foolhardy   cut  hispaniola  her anchor i   coracle would  knocked clean out   water this brought me   full stop  if fortune had not again particularly favoured me i should have had  abandon my design but  light airs which had begun blowing   southeast  south had hauled round after nightfall into  southwest just while i  meditating  puff came caught  hispaniola  forced her up into  current   my great joy i felt  hawser slacken  my grasp   hand  which i held  dip   second under water with  i made my mind up took out my gully opened   my teeth  cut one strand after another till  vessel swung only  two then i lay quiet waiting  sever these last when  strain should  once more lightened   breath  wind all this time i had heard  sound  loud voices   cabin but  say truth my mind had been so entirely taken up  other thoughts  i had scarcely given ear now however when i had nothing else  do i began  pay more heed one i recognized   coxswain’s israel hands  had been flint’s gunner  former days the other was  course my friend   red nightcap both men  plainly  worse  drink  they  still drinking  even while i  listening one  them   drunken cry opened  stern window  threw out something which i divined    empty bottle but they  not only tipsy   plain  they  furiously angry oaths flew like hailstones  every now  then there came forth such  explosion  i thought  sure  end  blows but each time  quarrel passed off   voices grumbled lower   while until  next crisis came    turn passed away without result on shore i could see  glow   great campfire burning warmly through  shoreside trees someone  singing  dull old droning sailor’s song   droop   quaver   end  every verse  seemingly no end    all but  patience   singer i had heard    voyage more than once  remembered these words “but one man  her crew alive what put  sea  seventyfive” and i thought    ditty rather too dolefully appropriate   company  had met such cruel losses   morning but indeed  what i saw all these buccaneers   callous   sea they sailed on at last  breeze came  schooner sidled  drew nearer   dark i felt  hawser slacken once more    good tough effort cut  last fibres through the breeze had but little action   coracle  i  almost instantly swept against  bows   hispaniola at  same time  schooner began  turn upon her heel spinning slowly end  end across  current i wrought like  fiend  i expected every moment   swamped  since i found i could not push  coracle directly off i now shoved straight astern at length i  clear  my dangerous neighbour  just  i gave  last impulsion my hands came across  light cord   trailing overboard across  stern bulwarks instantly i grasped it why i should have done so i can hardly say it   first mere instinct but once i had   my hands  found  fast curiosity began  get  upper hand  i determined i should have one look through  cabin window i pulled  hand over hand   cord  when i judged myself near enough rose  infinite risk  about half my height  thus commanded  roof   slice   interior   cabin by this time  schooner  her little consort  gliding pretty swiftly through  water indeed we had already fetched up level   campfire the ship  talking  sailors say loudly treading  innumerable ripples   incessant weltering splash  until i got my eye above  windowsill i could not comprehend why  watchmen had taken no alarm one glance however  sufficient    only one glance  i durst take   unsteady skiff it showed me hands  his companion locked together  deadly wrestle each   hand upon  other’s throat i dropped upon  thwart again none too soon  i  near overboard i could see nothing   moment but these two furious encrimsoned faces swaying together under  smoky lamp  i shut my eyes  let them grow once more familiar   darkness the endless ballad had come   end  last   whole diminished company about  campfire had broken into  chorus i had heard so often “fifteen men   dead man’s chest yohoho   bottle  rum drink   devil had done   rest yohoho   bottle  rum” i  just thinking how busy drink   devil    very moment   cabin   hispaniola when i  surprised   sudden lurch   coracle at  same moment she yawed sharply  seemed  change her course the speed   meantime had strangely increased i opened my eyes  once all round me  little ripples combing over   sharp bristling sound  slightly phosphorescent the hispaniola herself  few yards  whose wake i  still being whirled along seemed  stagger  her course  i saw her spars toss  little against  blackness   night nay  i looked longer i made sure she also  wheeling   southward i glanced over my shoulder  my heart jumped against my ribs there right behind me   glow   campfire the current had turned  right angles sweeping round along    tall schooner   little dancing coracle ever quickening ever bubbling higher ever muttering louder  went spinning through  narrows   open sea suddenly  schooner  front  me gave  violent yaw turning perhaps through twenty degrees  almost   same moment one shout followed another   board i could hear feet pounding   companion ladder  i knew   two drunkards had  last been interrupted  their quarrel  awakened   sense  their disaster i lay down flat   bottom   wretched skiff  devoutly recommended my spirit   maker at  end   straits i made sure we must fall into some bar  raging breakers where all my troubles would  ended speedily  though i could perhaps bear  die i could not bear  look upon my fate   approached so i must have lain  hours continually beaten   fro upon  billows now  again wetted  flying sprays  never ceasing  expect death   next plunge gradually weariness grew upon me  numbness  occasional stupor fell upon my mind even   midst  my terrors until sleep  last supervened   my seatossed coracle i lay  dreamed  home   old admiral benbow  the cruise   coracle it  broad day when i awoke  found myself tossing   southwest end  treasure island the sun  up but  still hid  me behind  great bulk   spyglass which  this side descended almost   sea  formidable cliffs haulbowline head  mizzenmast hill   my elbow  hill bare  dark  head bound  cliffs forty or fifty feet high  fringed  great masses  fallen rock i  scarce  quarter   mile  seaward    my first thought  paddle   land that notion  soon given over among  fallen rocks  breakers spouted  bellowed loud reverberations heavy sprays flying  falling succeeded one another  second  second  i saw myself if i ventured nearer dashed  death upon  rough shore or spending my strength  vain  scale  beetling crags nor   all  crawling together  flat tables  rock or letting themselves drop into  sea  loud reports i beheld huge slimy monsterssoft snails   were  incredible bignesstwo or three score  them together making  rocks  echo  their barkings i have understood since  they  sea lions  entirely harmless but  look  them added   difficulty   shore   high running   surf  more than enough  disgust me   landingplace i felt willing rather  starve  sea than  confront such perils in  meantime i had  better chance  i supposed before me north  haulbowline head  land runs   long way leaving  low tide  long stretch  yellow sand to  north  that again there comes another capecape   woods    marked upon  chartburied  tall green pines which descended   margin   sea i remembered what silver had said about  current  sets northward along  whole west coast  treasure island  seeing  my position  i  already under  influence i preferred  leave haulbowline head behind me  reserve my strength   attempt  land upon  kindlierlooking cape   woods there   great smooth swell upon  sea the wind blowing steady  gentle   south there  no contrariety between    current   billows rose  fell unbroken had  been otherwise i must long ago have perished but   was   surprising how easily  securely my little  light boat could ride often  i still lay   bottom  kept no more than  eye above  gunwale i would see  big blue summit heaving close above me yet  coracle would but bounce  little dance  if  springs  subside   other side into  trough  lightly   bird i began after  little  grow very bold  sat up  try my skill  paddling but even  small change   disposition   weight  produce violent changes   behaviour   coracle and i had hardly moved before  boat giving up  once her gentle dancing movement ran straight down  slope  water so steep   made me giddy  struck her nose   spout  spray deep into  side   next wave i  drenched  terrified  fell instantly back into my old position whereupon  coracle seemed  find her head again  led me  softly  before among  billows it  plain she  not   interfered with    rate since i could  no way influence her course what hope had i left  reaching land i began   horribly frightened but i kept my head  all that first moving  all care i gradually baled out  coracle  my seacap then getting my eye once more above  gunwale i set myself  study how   she managed  slip so quietly through  rollers i found each wave instead   big smooth glossy mountain  looks  shore or   vessel’s deck   all  world like any range  hills  dry land full  peaks  smooth places  valleys the coracle left  herself turning  side  side threaded so  speak her way through these lower parts  avoided  steep slopes  higher toppling summits   wave “well now” thought i  myself “it  plain i must lie where i am  not disturb  balance but   plain also  i can put  paddle over  side   time  time  smooth places give her  shove or two towards land” no sooner thought upon than done there i lay  my elbows   most trying attitude  every now  again gave  weak stroke or two  turn her head  shore it  very tiring  slow work yet i did visibly gain ground   we drew near  cape   woods though i saw i must infallibly miss  point i had still made some hundred yards  easting i was indeed close in i could see  cool green treetops swaying together   breeze  i felt sure i should make  next promontory without fail it  high time  i now began   tortured  thirst the glow   sun  above  thousandfold reflection   waves  seawater  fell  dried upon me caking my very lips  salt combined  make my throat burn  my brain ache the sight   trees so near  hand had almost made me sick  longing but  current had soon carried me past  point    next reach  sea opened out i beheld  sight  changed  nature  my thoughts right  front  me not half  mile away i beheld  hispaniola under sail i made sure  course  i should  taken but i  so distressed  want  water  i scarce knew whether   glad or sorry   thought  long before i had come   conclusion surprise had taken entire possession  my mind  i could do nothing but stare  wonder the hispaniola  under her mainsail  two jibs   beautiful white canvas shone   sun like snow or silver when i first sighted her all her sails  drawing she  lying  course about northwest  i presumed  men  board  going round  island  their way back   anchorage presently she began  fetch more  more   westward so  i thought they had sighted me   going about  chase at last however she fell right into  wind’s eye  taken dead aback  stood there awhile helpless  her sails shivering “clumsy fellows” said i “they must still  drunk  owls” and i thought how captain smollett would have set them skipping meanwhile  schooner gradually fell off  filled again upon another tack sailed swiftly   minute or so  brought up once more dead   wind’s eye again  again  this repeated to  fro up  down north south east  west  hispaniola sailed  swoops  dashes   each repetition ended  she had begun  idly flapping canvas it became plain  me  nobody  steering and if so where   men either they  dead drunk or had deserted her i thought  perhaps if i could get  board i might return  vessel  her captain the current  bearing coracle  schooner southward   equal rate as   latter’s sailing   so wild  intermittent  she hung each time so long  irons  she certainly gained nothing if she did not even lose if only i dared  sit up  paddle i made sure  i could overhaul her the scheme had  air  adventure  inspired me   thought   water breaker beside  fore companion doubled my growing courage up i got  welcomed almost instantly  another cloud  spray but this time stuck  my purpose  set myself  all my strength  caution  paddle after  unsteered hispaniola once i shipped  sea so heavy  i had  stop  bail  my heart fluttering like  bird but gradually i got into  way   thing  guided my coracle among  waves  only now  then  blow upon her bows   dash  foam  my face i  now gaining rapidly   schooner i could see  brass glisten   tiller   banged about  still no soul appeared upon her decks i could not choose but suppose she  deserted if not  men  lying drunk below where i might batten them down perhaps  do what i chose   ship for some time she had been doing  worse thing possible  mestanding still she headed nearly due south yawing  course all  time each time she fell off her sails partly filled  these brought her   moment right   wind again i have said this   worst thing possible  me  helpless  she looked  this situation   canvas cracking like cannon   blocks trundling  banging   deck she still continued  run away  me not only   speed   current but   whole amount  her leeway which  naturally great but now  last i had my chance the breeze fell  some seconds very low   current gradually turning her  hispaniola revolved slowly round her centre   last presented me her stern   cabin window still gaping open   lamp over  table still burning  into  day the mainsail hung drooped like  banner she  stockstill but   current for  last little while i had even lost but now redoubling my efforts i began once more  overhaul  chase i  not  hundred yards  her when  wind came again   clap she filled   port tack   off again stooping  skimming like  swallow my first impulse  one  despair but my second  towards joy round she came till she  broadside   meround still till she had covered  half  then two thirds  then three quarters   distance  separated us i could see  waves boiling white under her forefoot immensely tall she looked  me  my low station   coracle and then   sudden i began  comprehend i had scarce time  thinkscarce time  act  save myself i    summit  one swell when  schooner came stooping over  next the bowsprit  over my head i sprang  my feet  leaped stamping  coracle under water with one hand i caught  jibboom while my foot  lodged between  stay   brace   i still clung there panting  dull blow told me   schooner had charged down upon  struck  coracle   i  left without retreat   hispaniola  i strike  jolly roger i had scarce gained  position   bowsprit when  flying jib flapped  filled upon  other tack   report like  gun the schooner trembled  her keel under  reverse but next moment  other sails still drawing  jib flapped back again  hung idle this had nearly tossed me off into  sea  now i lost no time crawled back along  bowsprit  tumbled head foremost   deck i    lee side   forecastle   mainsail which  still drawing concealed  me  certain portion   afterdeck not  soul    seen the planks which had not been swabbed since  mutiny bore  print  many feet   empty bottle broken   neck tumbled   fro like  live thing   scuppers suddenly  hispaniola came right into  wind the jibs behind me cracked aloud  rudder slammed to  whole ship gave  sickening heave  shudder    same moment  mainboom swung inboard  sheet groaning   blocks  showed me  lee afterdeck there   two watchmen sure enough redcap  his back  stiff   handspike  his arms stretched out like those   crucifix  his teeth showing through his open lips israel hands propped against  bulwarks his chin  his chest his hands lying open before him   deck his face  white under  tan   tallow candle for  while  ship kept bucking  sidling like  vicious horse  sails filling now  one tack now  another   boom swinging   fro till  mast groaned aloud under  strain now  again too there would come  cloud  light sprays over  bulwark   heavy blow   ship’s bows against  swell so much heavier weather  made    this great rigged ship than  my homemade lopsided coracle now gone   bottom   sea at every jump   schooner redcap slipped   fro butwhat  ghastly  beholdneither his attitude nor his fixed teethdisclosing grin  anyway disturbed  this rough usage at every jump too hands appeared still more  sink into himself  settle down upon  deck his feet sliding ever  farther out   whole body canting towards  stern so  his face became little  little hid  me   last i could see nothing beyond his ear   frayed ringlet  one whisker at  same time i observed around both  them splashes  dark blood upon  planks  began  feel sure  they had killed each other  their drunken wrath while i  thus looking  wondering   calm moment when  ship  still israel hands turned partly round    low moan writhed himself back   position  which i had seen him first the moan which told  pain  deadly weakness   way  which his jaw hung open went right  my heart but when i remembered  talk i had overheard   apple barrel all pity left me i walked aft until i reached  mainmast “come aboard mr hands” i said ironically he rolled his eyes round heavily but   too far gone  express surprise all  could do   utter one word “brandy” it occurred  me there  no time  lose  dodging  boom   once more lurched across  deck i slipped aft  down  companion stairs into  cabin it  such  scene  confusion  you can hardly fancy all  lockfast places had been broken open  quest   chart the floor  thick  mud where ruffians had sat down  drink or consult after wading   marshes round their camp the bulkheads all painted  clear white  beaded round  gilt bore  pattern  dirty hands dozens  empty bottles clinked together  corners   rolling   ship one   doctor’s medical books lay open   table half   leaves gutted out i suppose  pipelights in  midst  all this  lamp still cast  smoky glow obscure  brown  umber i went into  cellar all  barrels  gone    bottles  most surprising number had been drunk out  thrown away certainly since  mutiny began not  man  them could ever have been sober foraging about i found  bottle  some brandy left  hands   myself i routed out some biscuit some pickled fruits  great bunch  raisins   piece  cheese with these i came  deck put down my own stock behind  rudder head  well out   coxswain’s reach went forward   waterbreaker  had  good deep drink  water  then  not till then gave hands  brandy he must have drunk  gill before  took  bottle  his mouth “aye” said he “by thunder but i wanted some o’ that” i had sat down already  my own corner  begun  eat “much hurt” i asked him he grunted or rather i might say  barked “if  doctor  aboard”  said “i’d  right enough   couple  turns but i don’t have no manner  luck you see  that’s what’s  matter  me as   swab he’s good  dead  is”  added indicating  man   red cap “he warn’t no seaman anyhow and where mought you have come from” “well” said i “i’ve come aboard  take possession  this ship mr hands  you’ll please regard me  your captain until further notice” he looked  me sourly enough but said nothing some   colour had come back into his cheeks though  still looked very sick  still continued  slip out  settle down   ship banged about “by  by” i continued “i can’t have these colours mr hands   your leave i’ll strike ’em better none than these” and again dodging  boom i ran   colour lines handed down their cursed black flag  chucked  overboard “god save  king” said i waving my cap “and there’s  end  captain silver” he watched me keenly  slyly his chin all  while  his breast “i reckon”  said  last “i reckon cap’n hawkins you’ll kind  want  get ashore now s’pose we talks” “why yes” says i “with all my heart mr hands say on” and i went back  my meal   good appetite “this man”  began nodding feebly   corpse “o’brien  his name  rank irelanderthis man  me got  canvas  her meaning   sail her back well he’s dead now  isas dead  bilge  who’s  sail this ship i don’t see without i gives you  hint you ain’t  man  far’s i can tell now look here you gives me food  drink   old scarf or ankecher  tie my wound up you do  i’ll tell you how  sail her  that’s about square all round i take it” “i’ll tell you one thing” says i “i’m not going back  captain kidd’s anchorage i mean  get into north inlet  beach her quietly there” “to  sure you did”  cried “why i ain’t sich  infernal lubber after all i can see can’t i i’ve tried my fling i have  i’ve lost  it’s you   wind  me north inlet why i haven’t no ch’ice not i i’d help you sail her up  execution dock  thunder so i would” well   seemed  me there  some sense  this we struck our bargain   spot in three minutes i had  hispaniola sailing easily before  wind along  coast  treasure island  good hopes  turning  northern point ere noon  beating down again  far  north inlet before high water when we might beach her safely  wait till  subsiding tide permitted us  land then i lashed  tiller  went below  my own chest where i got  soft silk handkerchief  my mother’s with this   my aid hands bound up  great

followed me derisively about  deck   odd smile  appeared continually  his face it   smile  had   something both  pain  weaknessa haggard old man’s smile but there was besides that  grain  derision

i don’t take no blame  settling his hash but i don’t reckon him ornamental now do you” “i’m not strong enough  i don’t like  job  there  lies  me” said i “this here’s  unlucky ship this hispaniola jim”  went on blinking “there’s  power  men been killed  this hispaniolaa sight o’ poor seamen dead  gone since you  me took ship  bristol i never seen sich dirty luck not i there  this here o’brien nowhe’s dead ain’t he well now i’m no scholar  you’re  lad  can read  figure   put  straight do you take    dead man  dead  good or do  come alive again” “you can kill  body mr hands but not  spirit you must know  already” i replied “o’brien there   another world  may  watching us” “ah” says he “well that’s unfort’nateappears  if killing parties   waste  time howsomever sperrits don’t reckon  much  what i’ve seen i’ll chance    sperrits jim and now you’ve spoke up free  i’ll take  kind if you’d step down into  there cabin  get me awell ashiver my timbers i can’t hit  name  ’t well you get me  bottle  wine jimthis here brandy’s too strong  my head” now  coxswain’s hesitation seemed   unnatural     notion  his preferring wine  brandy i entirely disbelieved it the whole story   pretext he wanted me  leave  deckso much  plain but  what purpose i could  no way imagine his eyes never met mine they kept wandering   fro up  down now   look   sky now   flitting glance upon  dead o’brien all  time  kept smiling  putting his tongue out   most guilty embarrassed manner so   child could have told    bent  some deception i  prompt  my answer however  i saw where my advantage lay     fellow so densely stupid i could easily conceal my suspicions   end “some wine” i said “far better will you have white or red” “well i reckon it’s about  blessed same  me shipmate”  replied “so it’s strong  plenty  it what’s  odds” “all right” i answered “i’ll bring you port mr hands but i’ll have  dig  it” with  i scuttled down  companion  all  noise i could slipped off my shoes ran quietly along  sparred gallery mounted  forecastle ladder  popped my head out   fore companion i knew  would not expect  see me there yet i took every precaution possible  certainly  worst  my suspicions proved too true he had risen  his position  his hands  knees  though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when  movedfor i could hear him stifle  groanyet     good rattling rate   trailed himself across  deck in half  minute  had reached  port scuppers  picked out   coil  rope  long knife or rather  short dirk discoloured   hilt  blood he looked upon    moment thrusting forth his under jaw tried  point upon his hand  then hastily concealing    bosom  his jacket trundled back again into his old place against  bulwark this  all  i required  know israel could move about   now armed  if  had been  so much trouble  get rid  me   plain  i  meant    victim what  would do afterwardswhether  would try  crawl right across  island  north inlet   camp among  swamps or whether  would fire long tom trusting  his own comrades might come first  help himwas  course more than i could say yet i felt sure  i could trust him  one point since   our interests jumped together      disposition   schooner we both desired  have her stranded safe enough   sheltered place  so that when  time came she could  got off again   little labour  danger  might be  until   done i considered  my life would certainly  spared while i  thus turning  business over  my mind i had not been idle  my body i had stolen back   cabin slipped once more into my shoes  laid my hand  random   bottle  wine  now  this   excuse i made my reappearance   deck hands lay  i had left him all fallen together   bundle   his eyelids lowered  though   too weak  bear  light he looked up however  my coming knocked  neck off  bottle like  man who had done  same thing often  took  good swig  his favourite toast  “here’s luck” then  lay quiet   little  then pulling out  stick  tobacco begged me  cut him  quid “cut me  junk o’ that” says he “for i haven’t no knife  hardly strength enough so   i had ah jim jim i reckon i’ve missed stays cut me  quid as’ll likely   last lad  i’m  my long home  no mistake” “well” said i “i’ll cut you some tobacco but if i  you  thought myself so badly i would go  my prayers like  christian man” “why” said he “now you tell me why” “why” i cried “you  asking me just now about  dead you’ve broken your trust you’ve lived  sin  lies  blood there’s  man you killed lying  your feet this moment  you ask me why for god’s mercy mr hands that’s why” i spoke   little heat thinking   bloody dirk  had hidden  his pocket  designed  his ill thoughts  end me with he  his part took  great draught   wine  spoke   most unusual solemnity “for thirty years”  said “i’ve sailed  seas  seen good  bad better  worse fair weather  foul provisions running out knives going  what not well now i tell you i never seen good come o’ goodness yet him  strikes first  my fancy dead men don’t bite them’s my viewsamen so  it and now you look here”  added suddenly changing his tone “we’ve had about enough  this foolery the tide’s made good enough  now you just take my orders cap’n hawkins  we’ll sail slap    done  it” all told we had scarce two miles  run but  navigation  delicate  entrance  this northern anchorage  not only narrow  shoal but lay east  west so   schooner must  nicely handled   got in i think i   good prompt subaltern  i am very sure  hands   excellent pilot  we went about  about  dodged in shaving  banks   certainty   neatness    pleasure  behold scarcely had we passed  heads before  land closed around us the shores  north inlet   thickly wooded  those   southern anchorage but  space  longer  narrower  more like what  truth  was  estuary   river right before us   southern end we saw  wreck   ship   last stages  dilapidation it had been  great vessel  three masts but had lain so long exposed   injuries   weather    hung about  great webs  dripping seaweed    deck   shore bushes had taken root  now flourished thick  flowers it   sad sight but  showed us   anchorage  calm “now” said hands “look there there’s  pet bit   beach  ship in fine flat sand never  cat’s paw trees all around  it  flowers ablowing like  garding   old ship” “and once beached” i inquired “how shall we get her off again” “why so”  replied “you take  line ashore there   other side  low water take  turn about one  them big pines bring  back take  turn around  capstan  lie    tide come high water all hands take  pull upon  line  off she comes  sweet  natur’ and now boy you stand by we’re near  bit now  she’s too much way  her starboard  littlesosteadystarboardlarboard  littlesteadysteady” so  issued his commands which i breathlessly obeyed till all   sudden  cried “now my hearty luff” and i put  helm hard up   hispaniola swung round rapidly  ran stem    low wooded shore the excitement  these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered   watch i had kept hitherto sharply enough upon  coxswain even then i  still so much interested waiting   ship  touch  i had quite forgot  peril  hung over my head  stood craning over  starboard bulwarks  watching  ripples spreading wide before  bows i might have fallen without  struggle  my life had not  sudden disquietude seized upon me  made me turn my head perhaps i had heard  creak or seen his shadow moving   tail  my eye perhaps    instinct like  cat’s but sure enough when i looked round there  hands already halfway towards me   dirk  his right hand we must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met but while mine   shrill cry  terror his   roar  fury like  charging bully’s at  same instant  threw himself forward  i leapt sideways towards  bows as i did so i let go   tiller which sprang sharp  leeward  i think this saved my life   struck hands across  chest  stopped him   moment dead before  could recover i  safe out   corner where  had me trapped  all  deck  dodge about just forward   mainmast i stopped drew  pistol  my pocket took  cool aim though  had already turned   once more coming directly after me  drew  trigger the hammer fell but there followed neither flash nor sound  priming  useless  seawater i cursed myself  my neglect why had not i long before reprimed  reloaded my only weapons then i should not have been  now  mere fleeing sheep before this butcher wounded   was   wonderful how fast  could move his grizzled hair tumbling over his face  his face itself  red   red ensign  his haste  fury i had no time  try my other pistol nor indeed much inclination  i  sure  would  useless one thing i saw plainly i must not simply retreat before him or  would speedily hold me boxed into  bows   moment since  had so nearly boxed me   stern once so caught  nine or ten inches   bloodstained dirk would  my last experience  this side  eternity i placed my palms against  mainmast which    goodish bigness  waited every nerve upon  stretch seeing  i meant  dodge  also paused   moment or two passed  feints  his part  corresponding movements upon mine it  such  game  i had often played  home about  rocks  black hill cove but never before you may  sure  such  wildly beating heart  now still  i say    boy’s game  i thought i could hold my own   against  elderly seaman   wounded thigh indeed my courage had begun  rise so high  i allowed myself  few darting thoughts  what would   end   affair  while i saw certainly  i could spin  out  long i saw no hope  any ultimate escape well while things stood thus suddenly  hispaniola struck staggered ground   instant   sand  then swift   blow canted over   port side till  deck stood   angle  fortyfive degrees  about  puncheon  water splashed into  scupper holes  lay   pool between  deck  bulwark we  both  us capsized   second  both  us rolled almost together into  scuppers  dead redcap  his arms still spread out tumbling stiffly after us so near  we indeed  my head came against  coxswain’s foot   crack  made my teeth rattle blow  all i   first afoot again  hands had got involved   dead body the sudden canting   ship had made  deck no place  running on i had  find some new way  escape   upon  instant  my foe  almost touching me quick  thought i sprang into  mizzen shrouds rattled up hand over hand  did not draw  breath till i  seated   crosstrees i had been saved  being prompt  dirk had struck not half  foot below me  i pursued my upward flight  there stood israel hands  his mouth open  his face upturned  mine  perfect statue  surprise  disappointment now  i had  moment  myself i lost no time  changing  priming  my pistol  then having one ready  service   make assurance doubly sure i proceeded  draw  load   other  recharge  afresh   beginning my new employment struck hands all   heap  began  see  dice going against him  after  obvious hesitation  also hauled himself heavily into  shrouds    dirk  his teeth began slowly  painfully  mount it cost him no end  time  groans  haul his wounded leg behind him  i had quietly finished my arrangements before   much more than  third   way up then   pistol  either hand i addressed him “one more step mr hands” said i “and i’ll blow your brains out dead men don’t bite you know” i added   chuckle he stopped instantly i could see   working  his face    trying  think   process  so slow  laborious that  my newfound security i laughed aloud at last   swallow or two  spoke his face still wearing  same expression  extreme perplexity in order  speak  had  take  dagger  his mouth but  all else  remained unmoved “jim” says he “i reckon we’re fouled you  me  we’ll have  sign articles i’d have had you but   there lurch but i don’t have no luck not i  i reckon i’ll have  strike which comes hard you see   master mariner   ship’s younker like you jim” i  drinking  his words  smiling away  conceited   cock upon  wall when all   breath back went his right hand over his shoulder something sang like  arrow through  air i felt  blow  then  sharp pang  there i  pinned   shoulder   mast in  horrid pain  surprise   momenti scarce can say    my own volition  i am sure   without  conscious aimboth my pistols went off  both escaped out  my hands they did not fall alone   choked cry  coxswain loosed his grasp upon  shrouds  plunged head first into  water  “pieces  eight” owing   cant   vessel  masts hung far out over  water   my perch   crosstrees i had nothing below me but  surface   bay hands who  not so far up   consequence nearer   ship  fell between me   bulwarks he rose once   surface   lather  foam  blood  then sank again  good as  water settled i could see him lying huddled together   clean bright sand   shadow   vessel’s sides a fish or two whipped past his body sometimes   quivering   water  appeared  move  little  if   trying  rise but   dead enough  all that being both shot  drowned   food  fish   very place where  had designed my slaughter i  no sooner certain  this than i began  feel sick faint  terrified the hot blood  running over my back  chest the dirk where  had pinned my shoulder   mast seemed  burn like  hot iron yet   not so much these real sufferings  distressed me  these  seemed  me i could bear without  murmur    horror i had upon my mind  falling   crosstrees into  still green water beside  body   coxswain i clung  both hands till my nails ached  i shut my eyes  if  cover up  peril gradually my mind came back again my pulses quieted down   more natural time  i  once more  possession  myself it  my first thought  pluck forth  dirk but either  stuck too hard or my nerve failed me  i desisted   violent shudder oddly enough  very shudder did  business the knife  fact had come  nearest   world  missing me altogether  held me   mere pinch  skin  this  shudder tore away the blood ran down  faster   sure but i  my own master again  only tacked   mast  my coat  shirt these last i broke through   sudden jerk  then regained  deck   starboard shrouds for nothing   world would i have again ventured shaken  i was upon  overhanging port shrouds  which israel had so lately fallen i went below  did what i could  my wound  pained me  good deal  still bled freely but   neither deep nor dangerous nor did  greatly gall me when i used my arm then i looked around me    ship  now   sense my own i began  think  clearing    last passengerthe dead man o’brien he had pitched  i have said against  bulwarks where  lay like some horrible ungainly sort  puppet lifesize indeed but how different  life’s colour or life’s comeliness in  position i could easily have my way  him    habit  tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror   dead i took him   waist  if  had been  sack  bran   one good heave tumbled him overboard he went    sounding plunge  red cap came off  remained floating   surface   soon   splash subsided i could see him  israel lying side  side both wavering   tremulous movement   water o’brien though still quite  young man  very bald there  lay   bald head across  knees   man who had killed him   quick fishes steering   fro over both i  now alone upon  ship  tide had just turned the sun  within so few degrees  setting  already  shadow   pines upon  western shore began  reach right across  anchorage  fall  patterns   deck the evening breeze had sprung up  though   well warded off   hill   two peaks upon  east  cordage had begun  sing  little softly  itself   idle sails  rattle   fro i began  see  danger   ship the jibs i speedily doused  brought tumbling   deck but  mainsail   harder matter of course when  schooner canted over  boom had swung outboard   cap     foot or two  sail hung even under water i thought this made  still more dangerous yet  strain  so heavy  i half feared  meddle at last i got my knife  cut  halyards the peak dropped instantly  great belly  loose canvas floated broad upon  water  since pull  i liked i could not budge  downhall    extent  what i could accomplish for  rest  hispaniola must trust  luck like myself by this time  whole anchorage had fallen into shadowthe last rays i remember falling through  glade   wood  shining bright  jewels   flowery mantle   wreck it began   chill  tide  rapidly fleeting seaward  schooner settling more  more  her beamends i scrambled forward  looked over it seemed shallow enough  holding  cut hawser  both hands   last security i let myself drop softly overboard the water scarcely reached my waist  sand  firm  covered  ripple marks  i waded ashore  great spirits leaving  hispaniola  her side  her mainsail trailing wide upon  surface   bay about  same time  sun went fairly down   breeze whistled low   dusk among  tossing pines at least   last i  off  sea nor had i returned thence emptyhanded there lay  schooner clear  last  buccaneers  ready  our own men  board  get  sea again i had nothing nearer my fancy than  get home   stockade  boast  my achievements possibly i might  blamed  bit  my truantry but  recapture   hispaniola   clenching answer  i hoped  even captain smollett would confess i had not lost my time so thinking   famous spirits i began  set my face homeward   block house  my companions i remembered   most easterly   rivers which drain into captain kidd’s anchorage ran   twopeaked hill upon my left  i bent my course   direction  i might pass  stream while   small the wood  pretty open  keeping along  lower spurs i had soon turned  corner   hill  not long after waded   midcalf across  watercourse this brought me near  where i had encountered ben gunn  maroon  i walked more circumspectly keeping  eye  every side the dusk had come nigh hand completely   i opened out  cleft between  two peaks i became aware   wavering glow against  sky where  i judged  man   island  cooking his supper before  roaring fire and yet i wondered  my heart   should show himself so careless for if i could see this radiance might  not reach  eyes  silver himself where  camped upon  shore among  marshes gradually  night fell blacker   all i could do  guide myself even roughly towards my destination  double hill behind me   spyglass  my right hand loomed faint  fainter  stars  few  pale    low ground where i wandered i kept tripping among bushes  rolling into sandy pits suddenly  kind  brightness fell about me i looked up  pale glimmer  moonbeams had alighted   summit   spyglass  soon after i saw something broad  silvery moving low down behind  trees  knew  moon had risen with this  help me i passed rapidly over what remained  me  my journey  sometimes walking sometimes running impatiently drew near   stockade yet  i began  thread  grove  lies before it i  not so thoughtless but  i slacked my pace  went  trifle warily it would have been  poor end  my adventures  get shot down  my own party  mistake the moon  climbing higher  higher  light began  fall here  there  masses through  more open districts   wood  right  front  me  glow   different colour appeared among  trees it  red  hot  now  again    little darkenedas  were  embers   bonfire smouldering for  life  me i could not think what  might be at last i came right down upon  borders   clearing the western end  already steeped  moonshine  rest   block house itself still lay   black shadow chequered  long silvery streaks  light on  other side   house  immense fire had burned itself into clear embers  shed  steady red reverberation contrasted strongly   mellow paleness   moon there  not  soul stirring nor  sound beside  noises   breeze i stopped  much wonder  my heart  perhaps  little terror also it had not been our way  build great fires we were indeed   captain’s orders somewhat niggardly  firewood  i began  fear  something had gone wrong while i  absent i stole round   eastern end keeping close  shadow    convenient place where  darkness  thickest crossed  palisade to make assurance surer i got upon my hands  knees  crawled without  sound towards  corner   house as i drew nearer my heart  suddenly  greatly lightened it  not  pleasant noise  itself  i have often complained    other times but just then   like music  hear my friends snoring together so loud  peaceful  their sleep the seacry   watch  beautiful “all’s well” never fell more reassuringly  my ear in  meantime there  no doubt  one thing they kept  infamous bad watch if  had been silver  his lads   now creeping   them not  soul would have seen daybreak that  what  was thought i  have  captain wounded  again i blamed myself sharply  leaving them   danger  so few  mount guard by this time i had got   door  stood up all  dark within so  i could distinguish nothing   eye as  sounds there   steady drone   snorers   small occasional noise  flickering or pecking  i could  no way account for with my arms before me i walked steadily in i should lie down  my own place i thought   silent chuckle  enjoy their faces when they found me   morning my foot struck something yieldingit   sleeper’s leg   turned  groaned but without awaking and then all   sudden  shrill voice broke forth out   darkness “pieces  eight pieces  eight pieces  eight pieces  eight pieces  eight”  so forth without pause or change like  clacking   tiny mill silver’s green parrot captain flint it  she whom i had heard pecking   piece  bark   she keeping better watch than any human being who thus announced my arrival  her wearisome refrain i had no time left me  recover at  sharp clipping tone   parrot  sleepers awoke  sprang up    mighty oath  voice  silver cried “who goes” i turned  run struck violently against one person recoiled  ran full into  arms   second who  his part closed upon  held me tight “bring  torch dick” said silver when my capture  thus assured and one   men left  loghouse  presently returned   lighted brand part sixcaptain silver  in  enemy’s camp the red glare   torch lighting up  interior   block house showed me  worst  my apprehensions realized the pirates   possession   house  stores there   cask  cognac there   pork  bread  before  what tenfold increased my horror not  sign  any prisoner i could only judge  all had perished  my heart smote me sorely  i had not been there  perish  them there  six   buccaneers all told not another man  left alive five  them   their feet flushed  swollen suddenly called out   first sleep  drunkenness the sixth had only risen upon his elbow   deadly pale   bloodstained bandage round his head told   had recently been wounded  still more recently dressed i remembered  man who had been shot  had run back among  woods   great attack  doubted not  this  he the parrot sat preening her plumage  long john’s shoulder he himself i thought looked somewhat paler  more stern than i  used to he still wore  fine broadcloth suit  which  had fulfilled his mission but   bitterly  worse  wear daubed  clay  torn   sharp briers   wood “so” said he “here’s jim hawkins shiver my timbers dropped in like eh well come i take  friendly” and thereupon  sat down across  brandy cask  began  fill  pipe “give me  loan   link dick” said he  then when  had  good light “that’ll do lad”  added “stick  glim   wood heap  you gentlemen bring yourselves to you needn’t stand up  mr hawkins he’ll excuse you you may lay  that and so jim”stopping  tobacco“here you were  quite  pleasant surprise  poor old john i see you  smart when first i set my eyes  you but this here gets away  me clean  do” to all this  may  well supposed i made no answer they had set me  my back against  wall  i stood there looking silver   face pluckily enough i hope  all outward appearance but  black despair  my heart silver took  whiff or two  his pipe  great composure  then ran  again “now you see jim so   you are here” says he “i’ll give you  piece  my mind i’ve always liked you i have   lad  spirit   picter  my own self when i  young  handsome i always wanted you  jine  take your share  die  gentleman  now my cock you’ve got to cap’n smollett’s  fine seaman  i’ll own up  any day but stiff  discipline ‘dooty  dooty’ says he  right  is just you keep clear   cap’n the doctor

yourself which might  lonely you’ll have  jine  cap’n silver” so far so good my friends then  still alive  though i partly believed  truth  silver’s statement   cabin party  incensed  me  my desertion i  more relieved than distressed  what i heard “i don’t say nothing   your being  our hands” continued silver “though there you are  you may lay  it i’m all  argyment i never seen good come out o’ threatening if you like  service well you’ll jine  if you don’t jim why you’re free  answer nofree  welcome shipmate  if fairer can  said  mortal seaman shiver my sides” “am i  answer then” i asked   very tremulous voice through all this sneering talk i  made  feel  threat  death  overhung me  my cheeks burned  my heart beat painfully  my breast “lad” said silver “no one’s apressing  you take your bearings none  us won’t hurry you mate time goes so pleasant  your company you see” “well” says i growing  bit bolder “if i’m  choose i declare i have  right  know what’s what  why you’re here  where my friends are” “wot’s wot” repeated one   buccaneers   deep growl “ah he’d   lucky one  knowed that” “you’ll perhaps batten down your hatches till you’re spoke to my friend” cried silver truculently  this speaker and then  his first gracious tones  replied  me “yesterday morning mr hawkins” said he “in  dogwatch down came doctor livesey   flag  truce says he ‘cap’n silver you’re sold out ship’s gone’ well maybe we’d been taking  glass   song  help  round i won’t say no leastways none  us had looked out we looked out   thunder  old ship  gone i never seen  pack o’ fools look fishier  you may

whole blessed boat  crosstrees  kelson as  them they’ve tramped i don’t know where’s they are” he drew again quietly  his pipe “and lest you should take  into  head  yours”  went on “that you  included   treaty here’s  last word   said ‘how many  you’ says i ‘to leave’ ‘four’ says he ‘four  one  us wounded as   boy i don’t know where  is confound him’ says he ‘nor i don’t much care we’re about sick  him’ these  his words “is  all” i asked “well it’s all  you’re  hear my son” returned silver “and now i am  choose” “and now you   choose  you may lay  that” said silver “well” said i “i am not such  fool but i know pretty well what i have  look for let  worst come   worst it’s little i care i’ve seen too many die since i fell   you but there’s  thing or two i have  tell you” i said   this time i  quite excited “and  first  this here you are   bad wayship lost treasure lost men lost your whole business gone  wreck  if you want  know who did itit  i i    apple barrel  night we

said “i believe you’re  best man here  if things go   worst i’ll take  kind  you  let  doctor know  way i took it” “i’ll bear   mind” said silver   accent so curious  i could not   life  me decide whether   laughing  my request or had been favourably affected  my courage “i’ll put one  that” cried  old mahoganyfaced seamanmorgan  namewhom i had seen  long john’s publichouse upon  quays  bristol “it  him  knowed black dog” “well  see here” added  seacook “i’ll put another again  that  thunder for   this same boy  faked  chart  billy bones first  last we’ve split upon jim hawkins” “then here goes” said morgan   oath and  sprang up drawing his knife  if  had been twenty “avast there” cried silver “who  you tom morgan maybe you thought you  cap’n here perhaps by  powers but i’ll teach you better cross me  you’ll go where many  good man’s gone before you first  last these thirty year backsome   yardarm shiver my timbers  some   board  all  feed  fishes there’s never  man looked me

hanged if i’ll  hazed  you john silver” “did any  you gentlemen want  have  out  me” roared silver bending far forward  his position   keg  his pipe still glowing  his right hand “put  name  what

sledgehammer but   ray  hope now shining  my bosom silver leant back against  wall his arms crossed his pipe   corner  his mouth  calm  though  had been  church yet his eye kept wandering furtively   kept  tail    his unruly followers they  their part drew gradually together towards  far end   block house   low hiss  their whispering sounded  my ear continuously like  stream one after another they would look up   red light   torch would fall   second  their nervous faces but   not towards me   towards silver  they turned their eyes “you seem  have  lot  say” remarked silver spitting far into  air “pipe up  let me hear it or lay to” “ax your pardon sir” returned one   men “you’re pretty free  some   rules maybe you’ll kindly keep  eye upon  rest this crew’s dissatisfied this crew don’t vally bullying  marlinspike this crew   rights like other crews i’ll make so free  that   your own rules i take  we can talk together i ax your pardon sir acknowledging you    captaing  this present but i claim my right  steps outside   council” and   elaborate seasalute this fellow  long illlooking yelloweyed man  five  thirty stepped coolly towards  door  disappeared out   house one after another  rest followed his example each making  salute   passed each adding some apology “according  rules” said one “forecastle council” said morgan and so  one remark or another all marched out  left silver  me alone   torch the seacook instantly removed his pipe “now look you here jim hawkins”  said   steady whisper   no more than audible “you’re within half  plank  death  what’s  long sight worse  torture they’re going  throw me off but you mark i stand  you through thick  thin i didn’t mean to no not till you spoke up i  about desperate  lose  much blunt   hanged into  bargain but i see you   right sort i says  myself you stand  hawkins john  hawkins’ll stand  you you’re his last card    living thunder john he’s yours back  back says i you save your witness  he’ll save your neck” i began dimly  understand “you mean all’s lost” i asked “aye  gum i do”  answered “ship gone neck gonethat’s  size  it once i looked into  bay jim hawkins  seen no schoonerwell i’m tough but i gave out as   lot  their council mark me they’re outright fools  cowards i’ll save your lifeif so   i canfrom them but see here jimtit  tatyou save long john  swinging” i  bewildered  seemed  thing so hopeless   askinghe  old buccaneer  ringleader throughout “what i can do  i’ll do” i said “it’s  bargain” cried long john “you speak up plucky   thunder i’ve  chance” he hobbled   torch where  stood propped among  firewood  took  fresh light  his pipe “understand me jim”  said returning “i’ve  head  my shoulders i have i’m  squire’s side now i know you’ve got  ship safe somewheres how you done it i don’t know but safe  is i guess hands  o’brien turned soft i never much believed  neither  them now you mark me i ask no questions nor i won’t let others i know when  game’s up i do  i know  lad that’s staunch ah you that’s youngyou  me might have done  power  good together” he drew some cognac   cask into  tin cannikin “will you taste messmate”  asked  when i had refused “well i’ll take  dram myself jim” said he “i need  caulker  there’s trouble  hand and talking o’ trouble why did  doctor give me  chart jim” my face expressed  wonder so unaffected   saw  needlessness  further questions “ah well  did though” said he “and there’s something under that no doubtsomething surely under that jimbad or good” and  took another swallow   brandy shaking his great fair head like  man who looks forward   worst  the black spot again the council  buccaneers had lasted some time when one  them reentered  house    repetition   same salute which had  my eyes  ironical air begged   moment’s loan   torch silver briefly agreed  this emissary retired again leaving us together   dark “there’s  breeze coming jim” said silver who had  this time adopted quite  friendly  familiar tone i turned   loophole nearest me  looked out the embers   great fire had so far burned themselves out  now glowed so low  duskily  i understood why these conspirators desired  torch about halfway down  slope   stockade they  collected   group one held  light another   his knees  their midst  i saw  blade   open knife shine  his hand  varying colours   moon  torchlight the rest  all somewhat stooping  though watching  manoeuvres  this last i could just make out   had  book  well   knife  his hand   still wondering how anything so incongruous had come  their possession when  kneeling figure rose once more  his feet   whole party began  move together towards  house “here they come” said i  i returned  my former position   seemed beneath my dignity  they should find me watching them “well let ’em come ladlet ’em come” said silver cheerily “i’ve still  shot  my locker” the door opened   five men standing huddled together just inside pushed one  their number forward in any other circumstances  would have been comical  see his slow advance hesitating   set down each foot but holding his closed right hand  front  him “step up lad” cried silver “i won’t eat you hand  over lubber i know  rules i do i won’t hurt  depytation” thus encouraged  buccaneer stepped forth more briskly  having passed something  silver  hand  hand slipped yet more smartly back again  his companions the seacook looked  what had been given him “the black spot i thought so”  observed “where might you have got  paper why hillo look here now this ain’t lucky you’ve gone  cut this out   bible what fool’s cut  bible” “ah there” said morgan “there wot did i say no good’ll come o’ that i said” “well you’ve about fixed  now among you” continued silver “you’ll all swing now i reckon what softheaded lubber had  bible” “it  dick” said one “dick  it then dick can get  prayers” said silver “he’s seen his slice  luck  dick  you may lay  that” but here  long man   yellow eyes struck in “belay  talk john silver”  said “this crew  tipped you  black spot  full council   dooty bound just you turn  over   dooty bound  see what’s wrote there then you can talk” “thanky george” replied  seacook “you always  brisk  business    rules  heart george  i’m pleased  see well what  it anyway ah ‘deposed’that’s it  it very pretty wrote   sure like print i swear your hand o’ write george why you  gettin’ quite  leadin’ man  this here crew you’ll  cap’n next i shouldn’t wonder just oblige me   torch again  you this pipe don’t draw” “come now” said george “you don’t fool this crew no more you’re  funny man  your account but you’re over now  you’ll maybe step down off  barrel  help vote” “i thought you said you knowed  rules” returned silver contemptuously “leastways if you don’t i do  i wait hereand i’m still your cap’n mindtill you outs  your grievances  i reply   meantime your black spot ain’t worth  biscuit after that we’ll see” “oh” replied george “you don’t  under no kind  apprehension we’re all square we are first you’ve made  hash  this cruiseyou’ll   bold man  say no  that second you let  enemy out o’ this here trap  nothing why did they want out i dunno but it’s pretty plain they wanted it third you wouldn’t let us go  them upon  march oh we see through you john silver you want  play booty that’s what’s wrong  you and then fourth there’s this here boy” “is  all” asked silver quietly “enough too” retorted george “we’ll all swing  sundry  your bungling” “well now look here i’ll answer these four p’ints one after another i’ll answer ’em i made  hash o’ this cruise did i well now you all know what i wanted  you all know if  had been done  we’d ’a been aboard  hispaniola this night  ever was every man  us alive  fit  full  good plumduff   treasure   hold  her  thunder well who crossed me

but this tops  stiffest yarn  nothing” silver paused  i could see   faces  george  his late comrades  these words had not been said  vain “that’s  number one” cried  accused wiping  sweat  his brow   had been talking   vehemence  shook  house “why i give you my word i’m sick  speak  you you’ve neither sense nor memory  i leave   fancy where your mothers   let you come  sea sea gentlemen o’ fortune i reckon tailors  your trade” “go on john” said morgan “speak up   others” “ah  others” returned john “they’re  nice lot ain’t they you say this cruise  bungled ah by gum if you could understand how bad it’s bungled you would see we’re  near  gibbet  my neck’s stiff  thinking  it you’ve seen ’em maybe hanged  chains birds about ’em seamen p’inting ’em out  they go down   tide ‘who’s that’ says

 downheartedand you’d have starved too if i hadn’tbut that’s  trifle you look therethat’s why” and  cast down upon  floor  paper  i instantly recognizednone other than  chart  yellow paper   three red crosses  i had found   oilcloth   bottom   captain’s chest why  doctor had given   him  more than i could fancy but if   inexplicable  me  appearance   chart  incredible   surviving mutineers they leaped upon  like cats upon  mouse it went  hand  hand one tearing   another    oaths   cries   childish laughter  which they accompanied their examination you would have thought not only they  fingering  very gold but   sea  it besides  safety “yes” said one “that’s flint sure enough j f   score below   clove hitch  it so  done ever” “mighty pretty” said george “but how  we  get away  it  us no ship” silver suddenly sprang up  supporting himself   hand against  wall “now i give you warning george”  cried “one more word  your sauce  i’ll call you down  fight you how why how do i know you had ought  tell me thatyou   rest  lost me my schooner  your interference burn you but not you you can’t you hain’t got  invention   cockroach but civil you can speak  shall george merry you may lay  that” “that’s fair enow” said  old man morgan “fair i reckon so” said  seacook “you lost  ship i found  treasure who’s  better man  that and now i resign  thunder elect whom you please   your cap’n now i’m done  it” “silver” they cried “barbecue forever barbecue  cap’n” “so that’s  toon  it” cried  cook “george i reckon you’ll have  wait another turn friend  lucky  you  i’m not  revengeful man but   never my way and now shipmates this black spot ’tain’t much good now  it dick’s crossed his luck  spoiled his bible  that’s about all” “it’ll do  kiss  book  still won’t it” growled dick who  evidently uneasy   curse  had brought upon himself “a bible   bit cut out” returned silver derisively “not it it don’t bind no more’n  balladbook” “don’t it though” cried dick   sort  joy “well i reckon that’s worth having too” “here jimhere’s  cur’osity  you” said silver   tossed me  paper it  around about  size   crown piece one side  blank   had been  last leaf  other contained  verse or two  revelationthese words among  rest which struck sharply home upon my mind “without  dogs  murderers” the printed side had been blackened  wood ash which already began  come off  soil my fingers   blank side had been written   same material  one word “depposed” i have  curiosity beside me  this moment but not  trace  writing now remains beyond  single scratch such   man might make  his thumbnail that   end   night’s business soon after   drink all round we lay down  sleep   outside  silver’s vengeance   put george merry up  sentinel  threaten him  death if  should prove unfaithful it  long ere i could close  eye  heaven knows i had matter enough  thought   man whom i had slain  afternoon  my own most perilous position  above all   remarkable game  i saw silver now engaged uponkeeping  mutineers together  one hand  grasping   other after every means possible  impossible  make his peace  save his miserable life he himself slept peacefully  snored aloud yet my heart  sore  him wicked   was  think   dark perils  environed   shameful gibbet  awaited him  on parole i was wakenedindeed we  all wakened  i could see even  sentinel shake himself together  where  had fallen against  doorpostby  clear hearty voice hailing us   margin   wood “block house ahoy”  cried “here’s  doctor” and  doctor  was although i  glad  hear  sound yet my gladness  not without admixture i remembered  confusion my insubordinate  stealthy conduct  when i saw where  had brought meamong what companions  surrounded  what dangersi felt ashamed  look him   face he must have risen   dark   day had hardly come  when i ran   loophole  looked out i saw him standing like silver once before up   midleg  creeping vapour “you doctor top o’  morning  you sir” cried silver broad awake  beaming  good nature   moment “bright  early   sure  it’s  early bird   saying goes  gets  rations george shake up your timbers son  help dr livesey over  ship’s side all adoin’ well your patients wasall well  merry” so  pattered on standing   hilltop  his crutch under his elbow  one hand upon  side   loghousequite  old john  voice manner  expression “we’ve quite  surprise  you too sir”  continued “we’ve  little stranger herehe he a noo boarder  lodger sir  looking fit  taut   fiddle slep’ like  supercargo  did right alongside  johnstem  stem we was all night” dr livesey   this time across  stockade  pretty near  cook  i could hear  alteration  his voice   said “not jim” “the very same jim  ever was” says silver the doctor stopped outright although  did not speak    some seconds before  seemed able  move on “well well”  said  last “duty first  pleasure afterwards  you might have said yourself silver let us overhaul these patients  yours” a moment afterwards  had entered  block house   one grim nod  me proceeded  his work among  sick he seemed under no apprehension though  must have known  his life among these treacherous demons depended   hair   rattled   his patients  if   paying  ordinary professional visit   quiet english family his manner i suppose reacted   men  they behaved  him  if nothing had occurred  if   still ship’s doctor  they still faithful hands before  mast “you’re doing well my friend”  said   fellow   bandaged head “and if ever any person had  close shave   you your head must   hard  iron well george how goes it you’re  pretty colour certainly why your liver man  upside down did you take  medicine did  take  medicine men” “aye aye sir  took it sure enough” returned morgan “because you see since i am mutineers’ doctor or prison doctor  i prefer  call it” says doctor livesey  his pleasantest way “i make   point  honour not  lose  man  king george god bless him   gallows” the rogues looked  each other but swallowed  homethrust  silence “dick don’t feel well sir” said one “don’t he” replied  doctor “well step up here dick  let me see your tongue no i should  surprised if  did the man’s tongue  fit  frighten  french another fever” “ah there” said morgan “that comed  sp’iling bibles” “that comesas you call itof being arrant asses” retorted  doctor “and not having sense enough  know honest air  poison   dry land   vile pestiferous slough i think  most probablethough  course it’s only  opinionthat you’ll all have  deuce  pay before you get  malaria out  your systems camp   bog would you silver i’m surprised  you you’re less   fool than many take you all round but you don’t appear  me  have  rudiments   notion   rules  health “well”  added after  had dosed them round  they had taken his prescriptions  really laughable humility more like charity schoolchildren than bloodguilty mutineers  pirates“well that’s done  today and now i should wish  have  talk   boy please” and  nodded his head  my direction carelessly george merry    door spitting  spluttering over some badtasted medicine but   first word   doctor’s proposal  swung round   deep flush  cried “no”  swore silver struck  barrel  his open hand “silence”  roared  looked about him positively like  lion “doctor”  went   his usual tones “i  athinking  that knowing  how you had  fancy   boy we’re all humbly grateful  your kindness   you see puts faith  you  takes  drugs down like  much grog and i take  i’ve found  way as’ll suit all hawkins  you give me your word  honour   young gentlemanfor  young gentleman you are although poor bornyour word  honour not  slip your cable” i readily gave  pledge required “then doctor” said silver “you just step outside o’  stockade  once you’re there i’ll bring  boy down   inside  i reckon you can yarn through  spars good day  you sir  all our dooties   squire  cap’n smollett” the explosion  disapproval which nothing but silver’s black looks had restrained broke out immediately  doctor had left  house silver  roundly accused  playing doubleof trying  make  separate peace  himself  sacrificing  interests  his accomplices  victims and  one word   identical exact thing    doing it seemed  me so obvious  this case  i could not imagine how    turn their anger but   twice  man  rest were  his last night’s victory had given him  huge preponderance  their minds he called them all  fools  dolts you can imagine said   necessary i should talk   doctor fluttered  chart  their faces asked them if they could afford  break  treaty  very day they  bound atreasurehunting “no  thunder”  cried “it’s us must break  treaty when  time comes  till then i’ll gammon  doctor if i have  ile his boots  brandy” and then  bade them get  fire lit  stalked out upon his crutch  his hand  my shoulder leaving them   disarray  silenced  his volubility rather than convinced “slow lad slow”  said “they might round upon us   twinkle   eye if we  seen  hurry” very deliberately then did we advance across  sand  where  doctor awaited us   other side   stockade   soon  we  within easy speaking distance silver stopped “you’ll make  note  this here also doctor” says he “and  boy’ll tell you how i saved his life   deposed   too  you may lay  that doctor when  man’s steering  near  wind  meplaying chuckfarthing   last breath  his body likeyou wouldn’t think  too much mayhap  give him one good word you’ll please bear  mind it’s not my life only nowit’s  boy’s into  bargain  you’ll speak me fair doctor  give me  bit o’ hope  go on   sake  mercy” silver   changed man once   out there  had his back  his friends   block house his cheeks seemed  have fallen in his voice trembled never   soul more dead  earnest “why john you’re not afraid” asked dr livesey “doctor i’m no coward no not inot so much”   snapped his fingers “if i  i wouldn’t say it but i’ll own up fairly i’ve  shakes upon me   gallows you’re  good man   true i never seen  better man and you’ll not forget what i done good not any more than you’ll forget  bad i know and i step asidesee hereand leave you  jim alone and you’ll put  down  me too  it’s  long stretch  that” so saying  stepped back  little way till   out  earshot  there sat down upon  treestump  began  whistle spinning round now  again upon his seat so   command  sight sometimes  me   doctor  sometimes  his unruly ruffians  they went   fro   sand between  firewhich they  busy rekindlingand  house  which they brought forth pork  bread  make  breakfast “so jim” said  doctor sadly “here you are as you have brewed so shall you drink my boy heaven knows i cannot find   my heart  blame you but this much i  say   kind or unkind when captain smollett  well you dared not have gone off  when   ill  couldn’t help it  george   downright cowardly” i  own  i here began  weep “doctor” i said “you might spare me i have blamed myself enough my life’s forfeit anyway  i should have been dead  now if silver hadn’t stood  me  doctor believe this i can dieand i dare say i deserve itbut what i fear  torture if they come  torture me” “jim”  doctor interrupted  his voice  quite changed “jim i can’t have this whip over  we’ll run  it” “doctor” said i “i passed my word” “i know i know”  cried “we can’t help that jim now i’ll take   my shoulders holus bolus blame  shame my boy but stay here i cannot let you jump one jump  you’re out  we’ll run   like antelopes” “no” i replied “you know right well you wouldn’t do  thing yourselfneither you nor squire nor captain  no more  i silver trusted me i passed my word  back i go but doctor you did not let me finish if they come  torture me i might let slip  word  where  ship is  i got  ship part  luck  part  risking  she lies  north inlet   southern beach  just below high water at half tide she must  high  dry” “the ship” exclaimed  doctor rapidly i described  him my adventures   heard me out  silence “there   kind  fate  this”  observed when i had done “every step it’s you  saves our lives  do you suppose  any chance  we  going  let you lose yours that would   poor return my boy you found out  plot you found ben gunnthe best deed  ever you did or  do though you live  ninety oh  jupiter  talking  ben gunn why this   mischief  person silver”  cried “silver i’ll give you  piece  advice”  continued   cook drew near again “don’t you   any great hurry after  treasure” “why sir i do my possible which  ain’t” said silver “i can only asking your pardon save my life   boy’s  seeking   treasure  you may lay  that” “well silver” replied  doctor “if   so i’ll go one step further look out  squalls when you find it” “sir” said silver “as between man  man that’s too much  too little what you’re after why you left  block house why you given me  there chart i don’t know now do i and yet i done your bidding  my eyes shut  never  word  hope but no this here’s too much if you won’t tell me what you mean plain out just say so  i’ll leave  helm” “no” said  doctor musingly “i’ve no right  say more it’s not my secret you see silver or i give you my word i’d tell  you but i’ll go  far  you  i dare go   step beyond  i’ll have my wig sorted   captain or i’m mistaken and first i’ll give you  bit  hope silver if we both get alive out  this wolftrap i’ll do my best  save you short  perjury” silver’s face  radiant “you couldn’t say more i’m sure sir not if you  my mother”  cried “well that’s my first concession” added  doctor “my second   piece  advice keep  boy close beside you  when you need help halloo i’m off  seek   you   itself  show you if i speak  random goodbye jim” and dr livesey shook hands  me through  stockade nodded  silver  set off   brisk pace into  wood  the treasurehuntflint’s pointer “jim” said silver when we  alone “if i saved your life you saved mine  i’ll not forget it i seen  doctor waving you  run  itwith  tail  my eye i did  i seen you say no  plain  hearing jim that’s one  you this   first glint  hope i had since  attack failed  i owe  you and now jim we’re  go   this here treasurehunting  sealed orders too  i don’t like it  you  me must stick close back  back like  we’ll save our necks  spite o’ fate  fortune” just then  man hailed us   fire  breakfast  ready  we  soon seated here  there about  sand over biscuit  fried junk they had lit  fire fit  roast  ox    now grown so hot  they could only approach    windward  even there not without precaution in  same wasteful spirit they had cooked i suppose three times more than we could eat  one  them   empty laugh threw what  left into  fire which blazed  roared again over this unusual fuel i never  my life saw men so careless   morrow hand  mouth   only word  can describe their way  doing  what  wasted food  sleeping sentries though they  bold enough   brush   done  it i could see their entire unfitness  anything like  prolonged campaign even silver eating away  captain flint upon his shoulder had not  word  blame  their recklessness and this  more surprised me  i thought  had never shown himself so cunning   did then “aye mates” said he “it’s lucky you have barbecue  think  you  this here head i got what i wanted i did sure enough they have  ship where they have it i don’t know yet but once we hit  treasure we’ll have  jump about  find out and then mates us    boats i reckon   upper hand” thus  kept running on  his mouth full   hot bacon thus  restored their hope  confidence and i more than suspect repaired his own   same time “as  hostage”  continued “that’s his last talk i guess  them  loves so dear i’ve got my piece o’ news  thanky  him  that but it’s over  done i’ll take him   line when we go treasurehunting  we’ll keep him like so much gold  case  accidents you mark    meantime once we got  ship  treasure both  off  sea like jolly companions why then we’ll talk mr hawkins over we will  we’ll give him his share   sure  all his kindness” it  no wonder  men    good humour now for my part i  horribly cast down should  scheme  had now sketched prove feasible silver already doubly  traitor would not hesitate  adopt it he had still  foot  either camp  there  no doubt  would prefer wealth  freedom   pirates   bare escape  hanging which   best  had  hope  our side nay  even

fallen backward down  hill we had thus proceeded  about half  mile   approaching  brow   plateau when  man upon  farthest left began  cry aloud  if  terror shout after shout came  him   others began  run  his direction “he can’t ’a found  treasure” said old morgan hurrying past us   right “for that’s clean atop” indeed  we found when we also reached  spot   something very different at  foot   pretty big pine  involved   green creeper which had even partly lifted some   smaller bones  human skeleton lay   few shreds  clothing   ground i believe  chill struck   moment  every heart “he   seaman” said george merry who bolder than  rest had gone up close   examining  rags  clothing “leastways this  good seacloth” “aye aye” said silver “like enough you wouldn’t look  find  bishop here i reckon but what sort   way    bones  lie ’tain’t  natur’” indeed   second glance  seemed impossible  fancy   body    natural position but  some disarray the work perhaps   birds  had fed upon him or   slowgrowing creeper  had gradually enveloped his remains  man lay perfectly straighthis feet pointing  one direction his hands raised above his head like  diver’s pointing directly   opposite “i’ve taken  notion into my old numbskull” observed silver “here’s  compass there’s  tiptop p’int o’ skeleton island stickin’ out like  tooth just take  bearing  you along  line  them bones” it  done the body pointed straight   direction   island   compass read duly ese   e “i thought so” cried  cook “this here   p’inter right up there  our line   pole star   jolly dollars but  thunder if  don’t make

find his’n lying round flint warn’t  man  pick  seaman’s pocket   birds i guess would leave  be” “by  powers  that’s true” cried silver “there ain’t  thing left here” said merry still feeling round among  bones “not  copper doit nor  baccy box it don’t look nat’ral  me” “no  gum  don’t” agreed silver “not nat’ral nor not nice says you great guns messmates but if flint  living this would   hot spot  you  me six they were  six  we  bones  what they  now” “i saw him dead  these here deadlights” said morgan “billy took me in there  laid  pennypieces  his eyes” “deadaye sure enough he’s dead  gone below” said  fellow   bandage “but if ever sperrit walked  would  flint’s dear heart but  died bad did flint” “aye   did” observed another “now  raged  now  hollered   rum  now  sang ‘fifteen men’  his only song mates  i tell you true i never rightly liked  hear  since it  main hot   windy  open  i hear  old song comin’ out  clear  clearand  deathhaul   man already” “come come” said silver “stow this talk he’s dead   don’t walk  i know leastways  won’t walk  day  you may lay  that care killed  cat fetch ahead   doubloons” we started certainly but  spite   hot sun   staring daylight  pirates no longer ran separate  shouting through  wood but kept side  side  spoke  bated breath the terror   dead buccaneer had fallen  their spirits  the treasurehuntthe voice among  trees partly   damping influence  this alarm partly  rest silver   sick folk  whole party sat down  soon  they had gained  brow   ascent the plateau being somewhat tilted towards  west this spot  which we had paused commanded  wide prospect  either hand before us over  treetops we beheld  cape   woods fringed  surf behind we not only looked down upon  anchorage  skeleton island but sawclear across  spit   eastern lowlandsa great field  open sea upon  east sheer above us rose  spyglass here dotted  single pines there black  precipices there  no sound but    distant breakers mounting  all round   chirp  countless insects   brush not  man not  sail upon  sea  very largeness   view increased  sense  solitude silver   sat took certain bearings  his compass “there  three ‘tall trees’” said he “about   right line  skeleton island ‘spyglass shoulder’ i take it means  lower p’int there it’s child’s play  find  stuff now i’ve half  mind  dine first” “i don’t feel sharp” growled morgan “thinkin’ o’ flinti think  wereas done me” “ah well my son you praise your stars he’s dead” said silver “he   ugly devil” cried  third pirate   shudder “that blue   face too” “that  how  rum took him” added merry “blue well i reckon   blue that’s  true word” ever since they had found  skeleton  got upon this train  thought they had spoken lower  lower  they had almost got  whispering  now so   sound  their talk hardly interrupted  silence   wood all   sudden out   middle   trees  front  us  thin high trembling voice struck up  wellknown air  words “fifteen men   dead man’s chest yohoho   bottle  rum” i never have seen men more dreadfully affected than  pirates the colour went  their six faces like enchantment some leaped  their feet some clawed hold  others morgan grovelled   ground “it’s flint  ” cried merry the song had stopped  suddenly   beganbroken off you would have said   middle   note  though someone had laid his hand upon  singer’s mouth coming through  clear sunny atmosphere among  green treetops i thought  had sounded airily  sweetly   effect  my companions   stranger “come” said silver struggling  his ashen lips  get  word out “this won’t do stand   go about this   rum start  i can’t name  voice but it’s someone skylarkingsomeone that’s flesh  blood  you may lay  that” his courage had come back   spoke  some   colour  his face along  it already  others had begun  lend  ear  this encouragement   coming  little  themselves when  same voice broke out againnot this time singing but   faint distant hail  echoed yet fainter among  clefts   spyglass “darby m’graw”  wailedfor    word  best describes  sound“darby m’graw darby m’graw” again  again  again  then rising  little higher    oath  i leave out “fetch aft  rum darby” the buccaneers remained rooted   ground their eyes starting  their heads long after  voice had died away they still stared  silence dreadfully before them “that fixes it” gasped one “let’s go” “they  his last words” moaned morgan “his last words above board” dick had his bible out   praying volubly he had been well brought up had dick before  came  sea  fell among bad companions still silver  unconquered i could hear his teeth rattle  his head but  had not yet surrendered “nobody  this here island ever heard  darby”  muttered “not one but us that’s here” and then making  great effort “shipmates”  cried “i’m here  get  stuff  i’ll not  beat  man or devil i never  feared  flint  his life and   powers i’ll face him dead there’s seven hundred thousand pound not  quarter   mile  here when did ever  gentleman o’ fortune show his stern   much dollars   boozy old seaman   blue mugand him dead too” but there  no sign  reawakening courage  his followers rather indeed  growing terror   irreverence  his words “belay there john” said merry “don’t you cross  sperrit” and  rest  all too terrified  reply they would have run away severally had they dared but fear kept them together  kept them close  john  if his daring helped them he  his part had pretty well fought his weakness down “sperrit well maybe”  said “but there’s one thing not clear  me there   echo now no man ever seen  sperrit   shadow well then what’s  doing   echo  him i should like  know that ain’t  natur’ surely” this argument seemed weak enough  me but you can never tell what  affect  superstitious   my wonder george merry  greatly relieved “well that’s so”  said “you’ve  head upon your shoulders john  no mistake ’bout ship mates this here crew    wrong tack i do believe and come  think  it   like flint’s voice i grant you but not just so clearaway like it after all it  liker somebody else’s voice nowit  liker” “by  powers ben gunn” roared silver “aye  so  were” cried morgan springing  his knees “ben gunn  were” “it don’t make much odds do it now” asked dick “ben gunn’s not here   body any more’n flint” but  older hands greeted this remark  scorn “why nobody minds ben gunn” cried merry “dead or alive nobody minds him” it  extraordinary how their spirits had returned  how  natural colour had revived  their faces soon they  chatting together  intervals  listening  not long after hearing no further sound they shouldered  tools  set forth again merry walking first  silver’s compass  keep them   right line  skeleton island he had said  truth dead or alive nobody minded ben gunn dick alone still held his bible  looked around him   went  fearful glances but  found no sympathy  silver even joked him  his precautions “i told you” said he“i told you you had sp’iled your bible if  ain’t no good  swear by what do you suppose  sperrit would give  it not that”   snapped his big fingers halting  moment  his crutch but dick  not   comforted indeed   soon plain  me   lad  falling sick hastened  heat exhaustion   shock  his alarm  fever predicted  dr livesey  evidently growing swiftly higher it  fine open walking here upon  summit our way lay  little downhill for  i have said  plateau tilted towards  west the pines great  small grew wide apart  even between  clumps  nutmeg  azalea wide open spaces baked   hot sunshine striking  we did pretty near northwest across  island we drew   one hand ever nearer under  shoulders   spyglass

entered   sailing mark upon  chart but   not  size  now impressed my companions    knowledge  seven hundred thousand pounds  gold lay somewhere buried below  spreading shadow the thought   money  they drew nearer swallowed up their previous terrors their eyes burned  their heads their feet grew speedier  lighter their whole soul  bound up   fortune  whole lifetime  extravagance  pleasure  lay waiting there  each  them silver hobbled grunting  his crutch his nostrils stood out  quivered  cursed like  madman when  flies settled  his hot  shiny countenance  plucked furiously   line  held me  him   time  time turned his eyes upon me   deadly look certainly  took no pains  hide his thoughts  certainly i read them like print in  immediate nearness   gold all else had been forgotten his

intended laden  crimes  riches shaken  i   these alarms   hard  me  keep up   rapid pace   treasurehunters now  again i stumbled    then  silver plucked so roughly   rope  launched  me his murderous glances dick who had dropped behind us  now brought up  rear  babbling  himself both prayers  curses  his fever kept rising this also added  my wretchedness   crown all i  haunted   thought   tragedy  had once been acted   plateau when  ungodly buccaneer   blue facehe who died  savannah singing  shouting  drinkhad there  his own hand cut down his six accomplices this grove   now so peaceful must then have rung  cries i thought  even   thought i could believe i heard  ringing still we  now   margin   thicket “huzza mates all together” shouted merry   foremost broke into  run and suddenly not ten yards further we beheld them stop a low cry arose silver doubled his pace digging away   foot  his crutch like one possessed  next moment   i had come also   dead halt before us   great excavation not very recent   sides had fallen   grass had sprouted   bottom in this   shaft   pick broken  two   boards  several packingcases strewn around on one  these boards i saw branded   hot iron  name walrusthe name  flint’s ship all  clear  probation the cache had been found  rifled  seven hundred thousand pounds  gone  the fall   chieftain there never  such  overturn  this world each  these six men   though  had been struck but  silver  blow passed almost instantly every thought  his soul had been set fullstretch like  racer   money well   brought up   single second dead   kept his head found his temper  changed his plan before  others had had time  realize  disappointment “jim”  whispered “take that  stand   trouble” and  passed me  doublebarrelled pistol at  same time  began quietly moving northward    few steps had put  hollow between us two   other five then  looked  me  nodded  much   say “here   narrow corner” as indeed i thought  was his looks  not quite friendly  i  so revolted  these constant changes  i could not forbear whispering “so you’ve changed sides again” there  no time left  him  answer in the buccaneers  oaths  cries began  leap one after another into  pit   dig  their fingers throwing  boards aside  they did so morgan found  piece  gold he held  up   perfect spout  oaths it   twoguinea piece   went  hand  hand among them   quarter   minute “two guineas” roared merry shaking   silver “that’s your seven hundred thousand pounds  it you’re  man  bargains ain’t you you’re him  never bungled nothing you woodenheaded lubber” “dig away boys” said silver   coolest insolence “you’ll find some pignuts  i shouldn’t wonder” “pignuts” repeated merry   scream “mates do you hear that i tell you now  man there knew  all along look   face  him  you’ll see  wrote there” “ah merry” remarked silver “standing  cap’n again you’re  pushing lad   sure” but this time everyone  entirely  merry’s favour they began  scramble out   excavation darting furious glances behind them one thing i observed which looked well  us they all got out upon  opposite side  silver well there we stood two  one side five   other  pit between us  nobody screwed up high enough  offer  first blow silver never moved  watched them very upright  his crutch  looked  cool  ever i saw him he  brave  no mistake at last merry seemed  think  speech might help matters “mates” says he “there’s two  them alone there one’s  old cripple  brought us all here  blundered us down  this  other’s  cub  i mean  have  heart of now mates” he  raising his arm  his voice  plainly meant  lead  charge but just thencrack crack crackthree musketshots flashed out   thicket merry tumbled head foremost into  excavation  man   bandage spun round like  teetotum  fell all his length upon his side where  lay dead but still twitching   other three turned  ran    all their might before you could wink long john had fired two barrels   pistol into  struggling merry    man rolled up his eyes  him   last agony “george” said he “i reckon i settled you” at  same moment  doctor gray  ben gunn joined us  smoking muskets  among  nutmegtrees “forward” cried  doctor “double quick my lads we must head ’em off  boats” and we set off   great pace sometimes plunging through  bushes   chest i tell you but silver  anxious  keep up  us the work  man went through leaping  his crutch till  muscles  his chest  fit  burst  work no sound man ever equalled  so thinks  doctor as  was   already thirty yards behind us    verge  strangling when we reached  brow   slope “doctor”  hailed “see there no hurry” sure enough there  no hurry in  more open part   plateau we could see  three survivors still running   same direction  they had started right  mizzenmast hill we  already between them   boats  so we four sat down  breathe while long john mopping his face came slowly up  us “thank ye kindly doctor” says he “you came   about  nick i guess  me  hawkins and so it’s you ben gunn”  added “well you’re  nice one   sure” “i’m ben gunn i am” replied  maroon wriggling like  eel  his embarrassment “and”  added after  long pause “how do mr silver pretty well i thank ye says you” “ben ben” murmured silver “to think  you’ve done me” the doctor sent back gray  one   pickaxes deserted  their flight   mutineers  then  we proceeded leisurely downhill  where  boats  lying related   few words what had taken place it   story  profoundly interested silver  ben gunn  halfidiot maroon   hero  beginning  end ben  his long lonely wanderings about  island had found  skeletonit    had rifled it  had found  treasure  had dug  up it   haft  his pickaxe  lay broken   excavation  had carried   his back  many weary journeys   foot   tall pine   cave  had   twopointed hill   northeast angle   island  there

morning finding  i    involved   horrid disappointment  had prepared   mutineers  had run all  way   cave  leaving  squire  guard  captain had taken gray   maroon  started making  diagonal across  island    hand beside  pine soon however  saw  our party had  start  him  ben gunn being fleet  foot had been dispatched  front  do his best alone then  had occurred  him  work upon  superstitions  his former shipmates    so far successful  gray   doctor had come up   already ambushed before  arrival   treasurehunters “ah” said silver “it  fortunate  me  i had hawkins here you would have let old john  cut  bits  never given   thought doctor” “not  thought” replied dr livesey cheerily and  this time we had reached  gigs the doctor   pickaxe demolished one  them  then we all got aboard  other  set out  go round  sea  north inlet this   run  eight or nine miles silver though   almost killed already  fatigue  set   oar like  rest  us  we  soon skimming swiftly over  smooth sea soon we passed out   straits  doubled  southeast corner   island round which four days ago we had towed  hispaniola as we passed  twopointed hill we could see  black mouth  ben gunn’s cave   figure standing  it leaning   musket it   squire  we waved  handkerchief  gave him three cheers  which  voice  silver joined  heartily  any three miles farther just inside  mouth  north inlet what should we meet but  hispaniola cruising  herself the last flood had lifted her  had there been much wind or  strong tide current    southern anchorage we should never have found her more or found her stranded beyond help as  was there  little amiss beyond  wreck   mainsail another anchor  got ready  dropped   fathom   half  water we all pulled round again  rum cove  nearest point  ben gunn’s treasurehouse  then gray singlehanded returned   gig   hispaniola where    pass  night  guard a gentle slope ran up   beach   entrance   cave at  top  squire met us to me   cordial  kind saying nothing  my escapade either   way  blame or praise at silver’s polite salute  somewhat flushed “john silver”  said “you’re  prodigious villain  impostera monstrous imposter sir i am told i am not  prosecute you well then i  not but  dead men sir hang about your neck like millstones” “thank you kindly sir” replied long john again saluting “i dare you  thank me” cried  squire “it   gross dereliction  my duty stand back” and thereupon we all entered  cave it   large airy place   little spring   pool  clear water overhung  ferns the floor  sand before  big fire lay captain smollett    far corner only duskily flickered over   blaze i beheld great heaps  coin  quadrilaterals built  bars  gold that  flint’s treasure  we had come so far  seek   had cost already  lives  seventeen men   hispaniola how many  had cost   amassing what blood  sorrow what good ships scuttled   deep what brave men walking  plank blindfold what shot  cannon what shame  lies  cruelty perhaps no man alive could tell yet there  still three upon  islandsilver  old morgan  ben gunnwho had each taken his share  these crimes  each had hoped  vain  share   reward “come in jim” said  captain “you’re  good boy  your line jim but i don’t think you  me’ll go  sea again you’re too much   born favourite  me is  you john silver what brings you here man” “come back  my dooty sir” returned silver “ah” said  captain    all  said what  supper i had    night  all my friends around me  what  meal  was  ben gunn’s salted goat  some delicacies   bottle  old wine   hispaniola never i am sure  people gayer or happier and there  silver sitting back almost out   firelight but eating heartily prompt  spring forward when anything  wanted even joining quietly  our laughterthe same bland polite obsequious seaman   voyage out  and last the next morning we fell early  work   transportation  this great mass  gold near  mile  land   beach  thence three miles  boat   hispaniola   considerable task  so small  number  workmen the three fellows still abroad upon  island did not greatly trouble us  single sentry   shoulder   hill  sufficient  ensure us against any sudden onslaught  we thought besides they had had more than enough  fighting therefore  work  pushed  briskly gray  ben gunn came  went   boat while  rest during their absences piled treasure   beach two   bars slung   rope’s end made  good load   grown manone    glad  walk slowly with for my part  i  not much use  carrying i  kept busy all day   cave packing  minted money into breadbags it   strange collection like billy bones’s hoard   diversity  coinage but so much larger  so much more varied  i think i never had more pleasure than  sorting them english french spanish portuguese georges  louises doubloons  double guineas  moidores  sequins  pictures  all  kings  europe   last hundred years strange oriental pieces stamped  what looked like wisps  string or bits  spider’s web round pieces  square pieces  pieces bored through  middle  if  wear them round your necknearly every variety  money   world must i think have found  place   collection   number i am sure they  like autumn leaves so  my back ached  stooping  my fingers  sorting them out day after day this work went on  every evening  fortune had been stowed aboard but there  another fortune waiting   morrow  all this time we heard nothing   three surviving mutineers at lasti think     third nightthe doctor  i  strolling   shoulder   hill where  overlooks  lowlands   isle when  out  thick darkness below  wind brought us  noise between shrieking  singing it  only  snatch  reached our ears followed   former silence “heaven forgive them” said  doctor “’tis  mutineers” “all drunk sir” struck   voice  silver  behind us silver i should say  allowed his entire liberty   spite  daily rebuffs seemed  regard himself once more  quite  privileged  friendly dependent indeed   remarkable how well  bore these slights   what unwearying politeness  kept  trying  ingratiate himself  all yet i think none treated him better than  dog unless   ben gunn who  still terribly afraid  his old quartermaster or myself who had really something  thank him for although   matter i suppose i had reason  think even worse  him than anybody else  i had seen him meditating  fresh treachery upon  plateau accordingly   pretty gruffly   doctor answered him “drunk or raving” said he “right you were sir” replied silver “and precious little odds which  you  me” “i suppose you would hardly ask me  call you  humane man” returned  doctor   sneer “and so my feelings may surprise you master silver but if i  sure they  ravingas i am morally certain one  least  them  down  feveri should leave this camp   whatever risk  my own carcass take them  assistance  my skill” “ask your pardon sir you would  very wrong” quoth silver “you would lose your precious life  you may lay  that i’m  your side now hand  glove  i shouldn’t wish   see  party weakened let alone yourself seeing  i know what i owes you but these men down there they couldn’t keep their wordno not supposing they wished to  what’s more they couldn’t believe  you could” “no” said  doctor “you’re  man  keep your word we know that” well   about  last news we had   three pirates only once we heard  gunshot  great way off  supposed them   hunting a council  held    decided  we must desert them   islandto  huge glee i must say  ben gunn    strong approval  gray we left  good stock  powder  shot  bulk   salt goat  few medicines  some other necessaries tools clothing  spare sail  fathom or two  rope    particular desire   doctor  handsome present  tobacco that  about our last doing   island before that we had got  treasure stowed  had shipped enough water   remainder   goat meat  case  any distress   last one fine morning we weighed anchor which  about all  we could manage  stood out  north inlet  same colours flying   captain had flown  fought under   palisade the three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for  we soon had proved for coming through  narrows we had  lie very near  southern point  there we saw all three  them kneeling together   spit  sand  their arms raised  supplication it went  all our hearts i think  leave them   wretched state but we could not risk another mutiny   take them home   gibbet would have been  cruel sort  kindness the doctor hailed them  told them   stores we had left  where they   find them but they continued  call us  name  appeal  us  god’s sake   merciful  not leave them  die  such  place at last seeing  ship still bore  her course   now swiftly drawing out  earshot one  themi know not which  wasleapt  his feet   hoarse cry whipped his musket  his shoulder  sent  shot whistling over silver’s head  through  mainsail after that we kept under cover

when we came alongside  hispaniola ben gunn   deck alone   soon  we came  board  began  wonderful contortions  make us  confession silver  gone the maroon had connived  his escape   shore boat some hours ago   now assured us  had only done so  preserve our lives which would certainly have been forfeit if “that man   one leg had stayed aboard” but this  not all the seacook had not gone emptyhanded he had cut through  bulkhead unobserved  had removed one   sacks  coin worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas  help him  his further wanderings i think we  all pleased   so cheaply
