enough” “you  nineandtwenty” she observed “and you’ve done nothing but” “knock about it  true our family doesn’t need  do things” this remark  mine rather annoyed rose  everybody knows and therefore there can  no harm  referring   fact that pretty  accomplished  she herself is her family  hardly   same standing   rassendylls besides her attractions she possessed  large fortune  my brother robert  wise enough not  mind about her ancestry ancestry is  fact  matter concerning which  next observation  rose’s  some truth “good families  generally worse than any others” she said upon this i stroked my hair i knew quite well what she meant “i’m so glad robert’s  black” she cried at this moment robert who rises  seven  works before breakfast came in he glanced  his wife her cheek  slightly flushed

skip  explanations yet  moment i begin  write one i find  i must have  explanation for   manifest  i must explain why my sisterinlaw  vexed  my nose  hair  why i ventured  call myself  elphberg for eminent as i must protest  rassendylls have been  many generations yet participation  their blood  course does not  first sight justify  boast   connection   grander stock   elphbergs or  claim   one   royal house for what relationship  there between ruritania  burlesdon between  palace  strelsau or  castle  zenda  number  park lane w well thenand i must premise  i am going perforce  rake up  very

honourable lineage   delicate subject  certainly this heredity we hear so much about   finest scandalmonger   world  laughs  discretion  writes strange entries between  lines   “peerages” it   observed  my sisterinlaw   want  logic  must have been peculiar  herself since we  no longer allowed  lay    charge  her sex treated my complexion almost   offence  which i  responsible hastening  assume   external sign inward qualities  which i protest my entire innocence  this unjust inference she sought  buttress  pointing   uselessness   life i had led well     may i had picked up  good deal  pleasure   good deal  knowledge i had been   german school   german university  spoke german  readily  perfectly  english i  thoroughly  home  french i had  smattering  italian  enough spanish  swear by i was i believe  strong though hardly fine swordsman   good shot i could ride anything  had  back  sit on  my head   cool  one  you could find  all  flaming cover if you say  i ought  have spent my time  useful labour i am out  court  have nothing  say save  my parents had no business  leave me two thousand pounds  year   roving disposition “the difference between you  robert” said my sisterinlaw who often bless her speaks   platform  oftener still  if she   one “is   recognizes  duties  his position  you see  opportunities  yours” “to  man  spirit my dear rose” i answered “opportunities  duties” “nonsense” said she tossing her head  after  moment she went on “now here’s sir jacob borrodaile offering you exactly what you might  equal to” “a thousand thanks” i murmured “he’s  have  embassy  six months  robert says   sure  he’ll take you   attache do take it rudolfto please me” now when my sisterinlaw puts  matter   way wrinkling her pretty brows twisting her little hands  growing wistful   eyes all  account   idle scamp like myself  whom she  no natural responsibility i am visited  compunction moreover i thought  possible  i could pass  time   position suggested  some tolerable amusement therefore i said “my dear sister if  six months’ time no unforeseen obstacle  arisen  sir jacob invites me hang me if i don’t go  sir jacob” “oh rudolf how good  you i am glad” “where’s  going to” “he doesn’t know yet but it’s sure    good embassy” “madame” said i “for your sake i’ll go if it’s no more than  beggarly legation when i do  thing i don’t do   halves” my promise then  given but six months  six months  seem  eternity and inasmuch  they stretched between me  my prospective industry i suppose attaches  industrious but i know not  i never became attache  sir jacob or anybody else i cast about  some desirable mode  spending them and  occurred  me suddenly  i would visit ruritania it may seem strange  i had never visited  country yet but my father in spite   sneaking fondness   elphbergs which led him  give me his second son  famous elphberg name  rudolf had always been averse  my going and since his death my brother prompted  rose had accepted  family tradition which taught   wide berth    given   country but  moment ruritania had come into my head i  eaten up   curiosity  see it after all red hair  long noses  not confined   house  elphberg   old story seemed  preposterously insufficient reason  debarring myself  acquaintance   highly interesting  important kingdom one which had played no small part  european history  might do  like again under  sway   young  vigorous ruler such   new king  rumoured  be my determination  clinched  reading  the times  rudolf  fifth    crowned  strelsau   course   next three weeks   great magnificence   mark  occasion at once i made up my mind   present  began my preparations but inasmuch    never been my practice  furnish my relatives   itinerary  my journeys   this case i anticipated opposition  my wishes i gave out  i  going   ramble   tyrolan old haunt  mineand propitiated rose’s wrath  declaring  i intended  study  political  social problems   interesting community which dwells   neighbourhood “perhaps” i hinted darkly “there may   outcome   expedition” “what do you mean” she asked “well” said i carelessly “there seems  gap  might  filled   exhaustive work on” “oh  you write  book” she cried clapping her hands “that would  splendid wouldn’t it robert” “it’s  best  introductions  political life nowadays” observed my brother who has   way introduced himself  this manner several times over burlesdon  ancient theories  modern facts  the ultimate outcome   political student  both works  recognized eminence “i believe you  right bob my boy” said i “now promise you’ll do it” said rose earnestly “no i won’t promise but if i find enough material i will” “that’s fair enough” said robert “oh material doesn’t matter” she said pouting but this time she could get no more than  qualified promise out  me to tell  truth i would have wagered  handsome sum   story  my expedition  summer would stain no paper  spoil not  single pen and  shows how little we know what  future holds  here i am fulfilling my qualified promise  writing  i never thought  write  bookthough   hardly serve   introduction  political life   not  jot  do   tyrol neither would it i fear please lady burlesdon if i   submit   her critical eyea step which i have no intention  taking chapter  concerning  colour  men’s hair it   maxim  my uncle william’s  no man should pass through paris without spending fourandtwenty hours there my uncle spoke out   ripe experience   world  i honoured his advice  putting up   day   night  “the continental”  my way tothe tyrol i called  george featherly   embassy  we had  bit  dinner together  durand’s  afterwards dropped    opera  after  we had  little supper  after  we called  bertram bertrand  versifier  some repute  paris correspondent  the critic he had  very comfortable suite  rooms  we found some pleasant fellows smoking  talking it struck me however  bertram himself  absent   low spirits  when everybody except ourselves had gone i rallied him  his moping preoccupation he fenced  me   while but  last flinging himself   sofa  exclaimed “very well have  your own way i am  loveinfernally  love” “oh you’ll write  better poetry” said i  way  consolation he ruffled his hair  his hand  smoked furiously george featherly standing  his back   mantelpiece smiled unkindly “if it’s  old affair” said he “you may  well throw  up bert she’s leaving paris tomorrow” “i know that” snapped bertram “not   would make any difference if she stayed” pursued  relentless george “she flies higher than  paper trade my boy” “hang her” said bertram “it would make  more interesting  me” i ventured  observe “if i knew who you  talking about” “antoinette mauban” said george “de mauban” growled bertram “oho” said i passing   question   de’ “you don’t mean  say bert” “can’t you let me alone” “where’s she going to” i asked   lady  something   celebrity george jingled his money smiled cruelly  poor bertram  answered pleasantly “nobody knows by  way bert i met  great man  her house  other nightat least about  month ago did you ever meet himthe duke  strelsau” “yes i did” growled bertram “an extremely accomplished man i thought him” it  not hard  see  george’s references   duke  intended  aggravate poor bertram’s sufferings so  i drew  inference   duke had distinguished madame de mauban  his attentions she   widow rich handsome and according  repute ambitious it  quite possible  she  george put it  flying  high   personage who  everything  could be short  enjoying strictly royal rank   duke   son   late king  ruritania   second  morganatic marriage  halfbrother   new king he had been his father’s favourite   had occasioned some unfavourable comment when  had been created  duke   title derived  no less  city than  capital itself his mother had been  good but not exalted birth “he’s not  paris now  he” i asked “oh no he’s gone back   present   king’s coronation  ceremony which i should say he’ll not enjoy much but bert old man don’t despair he won’t marry  fair antoinetteat least not unless another plan comes  nothing still perhaps she” he paused  added   laugh “royal attentions  hard  resistyou know that don’t you rudolf” “confound you” said i  rising i left  hapless bertram  george’s hands  went home  bed the next day george featherly went  me   station where i took  ticket  dresden “going  see  pictures” asked george   grin george   inveterate gossip  had i told him  i  off  ruritania  news would have been  london  three days   park lane   week i was therefore about  return  evasive answer when  saved my conscience  leaving me suddenly  darting across  platform following him  my eyes i saw him lift his hat  accost  graceful fashionably dressed woman who had just appeared   bookingoffice she was perhaps  year or two over thirty tall dark   rather full figure as george talked i saw her glance  me  my vanity  hurt   thought that muffled   fur coat   neckwrapper for    chilly april day  wearing  soft travelling hat pulled down  my ears i must  looking very far  my best a moment later george rejoined me “you’ve got  charming travelling companion”  said “that’s poor bert bertrand’s goddess antoinette de mauban and like you she’s going  dresdenalso no doubt  see  pictures it’s very queer though  she doesn’t  present desire  honour  your acquaintance” “i didn’t ask   introduced” i observed  little annoyed “well i offered  bring you  her but she said ‘another time’ never mind old fellow perhaps there’ll   smash  you’ll have  chance  rescuing her  cutting out  duke  strelsau” no smash however happened either  me or  madame de mauban i can speak  her  confidently   myself  when after  night’s rest  dresden i continued my journey she got into  same train understanding  she wished   let alone i avoided her carefully but i saw  she went  same way  i did   very end  my journey  i took opportunities  having  good look  her when i could do so unobserved as soon  we reached  ruritanian frontier where  old officer who presided over  custom house favoured me  such  stare  i felt surer than before  my elphberg physiognomy i bought  papers  found  them news which affected my movements for some reason which  not clearly explained  seemed   something   mystery  date   coronation had been suddenly advanced   ceremony   take place   next day but one the whole country seemed   stir about it    evident  strelsau  thronged rooms  all let  hotels overflowing there would  very little chance  my obtaining  lodging  i should certainly have  pay  exorbitant charge  it i made up my mind  stop  zenda  small town fifty miles short   capital  about ten   frontier my train reached there   evening i would spend  next day tuesday   wander over  hills which  said   very fine   taking  glance   famous castle  go over  train  strelsau   wednesday morning returning  night  sleep  zenda accordingly  zenda i got out    train passed where i stood   platform i saw my friend madame de mauban  her place clearly she  going through  strelsau having  more providence than i could boast secured apartments there i smiled  think how surprised george featherly would have been  know  she  i had been fellow travellers  so long i  very kindly received   hotelit  really no more than  innkept   fat old lady  her two daughters they  good quiet people  seemed very little interested   great doings  strelsau the old lady’s hero   duke    now under  late king’s will master   zenda estates    castle which rose grandly   steep hill   end   valley  mile or so   inn the old lady indeed did not hesitate  express regret   duke  not   throne instead  his brother “we know duke michael” said she “he  always lived among us every ruritanian knows duke michael but  king  almost  stranger   been so much abroad not one  ten knows him even  sight” “and now” chimed  one   young women “they say   shaved off his beard so  no one  all knows him” “shaved his beard” exclaimed her mother “who says so” “johann  duke’s keeper he  seen  king” “ah yes the king sir  now   duke’s huntinglodge   forest here  here  goes  strelsau   crowned  wednesday morning” i  interested  hear this  made up my mind  walk next day   direction   lodge   chance  coming across  king the old lady ran  garrulously “ah  i wish  would stay  his huntingthat  wine and one thing more  all  loves they sayand suffer our duke   crowned  wednesday that i wish  i don’t care who knows it” “hush mother” urged  daughters “oh there’s many  think  i do” cried  old woman stubbornly i threw myself back  my deep armchair  laughed  her zeal “for my part” said  younger  prettier   two daughters  fair buxom smiling wench “i hate black michael a red elphberg  me mother the king they say   red   fox or as” and she laughed mischievously  she cast  glance  me  tossed her head  her sister’s reproving face “many  man  cursed their red hair before now” muttered  old ladyand i remembered james fifth earl  burlesdon “but never  woman” cried  girl “ay  women when   too late”   stern answer reducing  girl  silence  blushes “how comes  king here” i asked  break  embarrassed silence “it   duke’s land here you say” “the duke invited him sir  rest here till wednesday the duke   strelsau preparing  king’s reception” “then they’re friends” “none better” said  old lady but my rosy damsel tossed her head again she  not   repressed  long  she broke out again “ay they love one another  men do who want  same place   same wife” the old woman glowered but  last words pricked my curiosity  i interposed before she could begin scolding “what  same wife too how’s that young lady” “all  world knows  black michaelwell then mother  dukewould give his soul  marry his cousin  princess flavia   she     queen” “upon my word” said i “i begin   sorry  your duke but if  man    younger son why  must take what  elder leaves    thankful  god   can” and thinking  myself i shrugged my shoulders  laughed and then i thought also  antoinette de mauban  her journey  strelsau “it’s little dealing black michael  with” began  girl braving her mother’s anger but  she spoke  heavy step sounded   floor   gruff voice asked   threatening tone “who talks  ‘black michael’  his highness’s own burgh” the girl gave  little shriek half  frighthalf i think  amusement “you’ll not tell  me johann” she said “see where your chatter leads” said  old lady the man who had spoken came forward “we have company johann” said my hostess   fellow plucked off his cap a moment later  saw me and  my amazement  started back  step  though  had seen something wonderful “what ails you johann” asked  elder girl “this   gentleman  his travels come  see  coronation” the man had recovered himself but   staring  me   intense searching almost fierce glance “good evening  you” said i “good evening sir”  muttered still scrutinizing me   merry girl began  laugh  she called “see johann    colour you love he started  see your hair sir it’s not  colour we see most  here  zenda” “i crave your pardon sir” stammered  fellow  puzzled eyes “i expected  see no one” “give him  glass  drink my health in  i’ll bid you good night  thanks  you ladies  your courtesy  pleasant conversation” so speaking i rose  my feet    slight bow turned   door the young girl ran  light me   way   man fell back  let me pass his eyes still fixed  me the moment i  by  started  step forward asking “pray sir do you know our king” “i never saw him” said i “i hope  do so  wednesday” he said no more but i felt his eyes following me till  door closed behind me my saucy conductor looking over her shoulder  me  she preceded me upstairs said “there’s no pleasing master johann  one  your colour sir” “he prefers yours maybe” i suggested “i meant sir   man” she answered   coquettish glance “what” asked i taking hold   other side   candlestick “does colour matter   man” “nay but i love yoursit’s  elphberg red” “colour   man” said i “is  matter  no more moment than that”and i gave her something  no value “god send  kitchen door  shut” said she “amen” said i  left her in fact however  i now know colour  sometimes  considerable moment   man chapter  a merry evening   distant relative i  not so unreasonable    prejudiced against  duke’s keeper because  disliked my complexion  if i had been his most civil  obliging conduct as  seemed  me  be next morning would have disarmed me hearing  i  bound  strelsau  came  see me while i  breakfasting  told me   sister  his who had married  welltodo tradesman  lived   capital had invited him  occupy  room  her house he had gladly accepted but now found  his duties would not permit  his absence he begged therefore that if such humble though   added clean  comfortable lodgings would satisfy me i would take his place he pledged his sister’s acquiescence  urged  inconvenience  crowding  which i should  subject  my journeys    strelsau  next day i accepted his offer without  moment’s hesitation   went off  telegraph  his sister while i packed up  prepared  take  next train but i still hankered after  forest   huntinglodge  when my little maid told me  i could  walking ten miles or so through  forest hit  railway   roadside station i decided  send my luggage direct   address which johann had given take my walk  follow  strelsau myself johann had gone off   not aware   change  my plans but   only effect   delay my arrival  his sister’s   few hours there  no reason  troubling  inform him  it doubtless  good lady would waste no anxiety  my account i took  early luncheon and having bidden my kind entertainers farewell promising  return  them  my way home i set out  climb  hill  led   castle  thence   forest  zenda half  hour’s leisurely walking brought me   castle it had been  fortress  old days   ancient keep  still  good preservation  very imposing behind  stood another portion   original castle  behind  again  separated     deep  broad moat which ran all round  old buildings   handsome modern chateau erected   last king  now forming  country residence   duke  strelsau the old   new portions  connected   drawbridge  this indirect mode  access formed  only passage between  old building   outer world but leading   modern chateau there   broad  handsome avenue it   ideal residence when “black michael” desired company  could dwell  his chateau if  fit  misanthropy seized him  had merely  cross  bridge  draw  up after him it ran  rollers  nothing short   regiment   train  artillery could fetch him out i went  my way glad  poor black michael though  could not have  throne or  princess had  least  fine  residence  any prince  europe soon i entered  forest  walked    hour or more   cool sombre shade the great trees enlaced  one another over my head   sunshine stole through  patches  bright  diamonds  hardly bigger i  enchanted   place and finding  felled treetrunk propped my back against it  stretching my legs out gave myself up  undisturbed contemplation   solemn beauty   woods    comfort   good cigar and when  cigar  finished  i had i suppose inhaled  much beauty  i could i went off into  most delightful sleep regardless  my train  strelsau    fastwaning afternoon to remember  train  such  spot would have been rank sacrilege instead  that i fell  dreaming  i  married   princess flavia  dwelt   castle  zenda  beguiled whole days  my love   glades   forestwhich made  very pleasant dream in fact i  just impressing  fervent kiss   charming lips   princess when i heard and  voice seemed  first  part   dream someone exclaim  rough strident tones “why  devil’s  it shave him  he’d   king” the idea seemed whimsical enough   dream   sacrifice  my heavy moustache  carefully pointed imperial i    transformed into  monarch i  about  kiss  princess again when i arrived very reluctantly   conclusion  i  awake i opened my eyes  found two men regarding me  much curiosity both wore shooting costumes  carried guns one  rather short  very stoutly built   big bulletshaped head  bristly grey moustache  small paleblue eyes  trifle bloodshot the other   slender young fellow  middle height dark  complexion  bearing himself  grace  distinction i set  one down   old soldier  other   gentleman accustomed  move  good society but not unused  military life either it turned out afterwards  my guess   good one the elder man approached me beckoning  younger  follow he did so courteously raising his hat i rose slowly  my feet “he’s  height too” i heard  elder murmur   surveyed my six feet two inches  stature then   cavalier touch   cap  addressed me “may i ask your name” “as you have taken  first step   acquaintance gentlemen” said i   smile “suppose you give me  lead   matter  names” the young man stepped forward   pleasant smile “this” said he “is colonel sapt  i am called fritz von tarlenheim we  both   service   king  ruritania” i bowed and baring my head answered “i am rudolf rassendyll i am  traveller  england  once   year or two i held  commission  her majesty  queen” “then we  all brethren   sword” answered tarlenheim holding out his hand which i took readily “rassendyll rassendyll” muttered colonel sapt then  gleam  intelligence flitted across his face “by heaven”  cried “you’re   burlesdons” “my brother  now lord burlesdon” said i “thy head betrayeth thee”  chuckled pointing  my uncovered poll “why fritz you know  story” the young man glanced apologetically  me he felt  delicacy which my sisterinlaw would have admired to put him  his ease i remarked   smile “ah  story  known here  well  among us  seems” “known” cried sapt “if you stay here  deuce  man  all ruritania  doubt  itor  woman either” i began  feel uncomfortable had i realized what  very plainly written pedigree i carried about  me i should have thought long before i visited ruritania however i     now at this moment  ringing voice sounded   wood behind us “fritz fritz where  you man” tarlenheim started  said hastily “it’s  king” old sapt chuckled again then  young man jumped out  behind  trunk   tree  stood beside us as i looked  him i uttered  astonished cry  he seeing me drew back  sudden wonder saving  hair  my face   manner  conscious dignity which his position gave him saving also   lacked perhaps half  inchnay less than that but still somethingof my height  king  ruritania might have been rudolf rassendyll  i rudolf  king for  instant we stood motionless looking  one another then i bared my head again  bowed respectfully the king found his voice  asked  bewilderment “colonelfritzwho  this gentleman” i  about  answer when colonel sapt stepped between  king  me  began  talk  his majesty   low growl the king towered over sapt and   listened his eyes now  again sought mine i looked  him long  carefully the likeness  certainly astonishing though i saw  points  difference also the king’s face  slightly more fleshy than mine  oval   contour  least trifle more pronounced and  i fancied his mouth lacking something   firmness or obstinacy which    gathered  my closeshutting lips but  all that  above all minor distinctions  likeness rose striking salient wonderful sapt ceased speaking   king still frowned then gradually  corners  his mouth began  twitch his nose came down as mine does when i laugh his eyes twinkled and behold  burst into  merriest fit  irrepressible laughter which rang through  woods  proclaimed him  jovial soul “well met cousin”  cried stepping up  me clapping me   back  laughing still “you must forgive me if i  taken aback a man doesn’t expect  see double  this time  day eh fritz” “i must pray pardon sire  my presumption” said i “i trust   not forfeit your majesty’s favour” “by heaven you’ll always enjoy  king’s countenance”  laughed “whether i like  or not and sir i shall very gladly add   what services i can where  you travelling to” “to strelsau sireto  coronation” the king looked  his friends  still smiled though his expression hinted some uneasiness but  humorous side   matter caught him again “fritz fritz”  cried “a thousand crowns   sight  brother michael’s face when  sees  pair  us”   merry laugh rang out again “seriously” observed fritz von tarlenheim “i question mr rassendyll’s wisdom  visiting strelsau just now” the king lit  cigarette “well sapt” said he questioningly “he mustn’t go” growled  old fellow “come colonel you mean  i should   mr rassendyll’s debt if” “oh ay wrap  up   right way” said sapt hauling  great pipe out  his pocket “enough sire” said i “i’ll leave ruritania today” “no  thunder you shan’tand that’s sans phrase  sapt likes it for you shall dine  me tonight happen what  afterwards come man you don’t meet  new relation every day” “we dine sparingly tonight” said fritz von tarlenheim “not wewith our new cousin   guest” cried  king and  fritz shrugged his shoulders  added “oh i’ll remember our early start fritz” “so  itomorrow morning” said old sapt pulling  his pipe “o wise old sapt” cried  king “come mr rassendyllby  way what name did they give you” “your majesty’s” i answered bowing “well  shows they weren’t ashamed  us”  laughed “come then cousin rudolf i’ve got no house  my own here but my dear brother michael lends us  place  his  we’ll make shift  entertain you there”   put his arm through mine and signing   others  accompany us walked me off westerly through  forest we walked  more than half  hour   king smoked cigarettes  chattered incessantly he  full  interest  my family laughed heartily when i told him   portraits  elphberg hair  our galleries  yet more heartily when  heard  my expedition  ruritania   secret one “you have  visit your disreputable cousin   sly have you” said he suddenly emerging   wood we came   small  rude huntinglodge it   onestorey building  sort  bungalow built entirely  wood as we approached it  little man   plain livery came out  meet us the only other person i saw about  place   fat elderly woman whom i afterwards discovered    mother  johann  duke’s keeper “well  dinner ready josef” asked  king the little servant informed us   was  we soon sat down   plentiful meal the fare  plain enough  king ate heartily fritz von tarlenheim delicately old sapt voraciously i played  good knife  fork  my custom is  king noticed my performance  approval “we’re all good trenchermen we elphbergs” said he “but whatwe’re eating dry wine josef wine man are we beasts  eat without drinking are we cattle josef” at this reproof josef hastened  load  table  bottles “remember tomorrow” said fritz “aytomorrow” said old sapt the king drained  bumper  his “cousin rudolf”    graciousor merryenough  call me  i drank  fellow   “elphberg red” whereat  laughed loudly now   meat what  might  wine we drank  beyond all price or praise  we did  justice fritz ventured once  stay  king’s hand “what” cried  king “remember you start before i do master fritzyou must  more sparing  two hours than i” fritz saw  i did not understand “the colonel  i”  explained “leave here  six we ride down  zenda  return   guard  honour  fetch  king  eight  then we all ride together   station” “hang  same guard” growled sapt “oh it’s very civil  my brother  ask  honour  his regiment” said  king “come cousin you need not start early another bottle man” i had another bottleor rather  part  one   larger half travelled quickly down his majesty’s throat fritz gave up his attempts  persuasion  persuading  fell  being persuaded  soon we  all  us  full  wine  we had any right  be the king began talking  what  would do   future old sapt  what  had done   past fritz  some beautiful girl or other  i   wonderful merits   elphberg dynasty we all talked  once  followed   letter sapt’s exhortation  let  morrow take care  itself at last  king set down his glass  leant back  his chair “i have drunk enough” said he “far    me  contradict  king” said i indeed his remark  most absolutely trueso far   went while i yet spoke josef came  set before  king  marvellous old wickercovered flagon it had lain so long  some darkened cellar   seemed  blink   candlelight “his highness  duke  strelsau bade me set this wine before  king when  king  weary  all other wines  pray  king  drink   love   bears his brother” “well done black michael” said  king “out   cork josef hang him did  think i’d flinch  his bottle” the bottle  opened  josef filled  king’s glass the king tasted it then   solemnity born   hour  his own condition  looked round  us “gentlemen my friendsrudolf my cousin ‘tis  scandalous story rudolf  my honour everything  yours   half  ruritania but ask me not   single drop  this divine bottle which i  drink   health  thatthat sly knave my brother black michael” and  king seized  bottle  turned  over his mouth  drained   flung   him  laid his head  his arms   table and we drank pleasant dreams  his majestyand   all i remember   evening perhaps   enough chapter  the king keeps his appointment whether i had slept  minute or  year i knew not i awoke   start   shiver my face hair  clothes dripped water  opposite me stood old sapt  sneering smile  his face   empty bucket  his hand on  table  him sat fritz von tarlenheim pale   ghost  black   crow under  eyes i leapt  my feet  anger “your joke goes too far sir” i cried “tut man we’ve no time  quarrelling nothing else would rouse you it’s five o’clock” “i’ll thank you colonel sapt” i began again hot  spirit though i  uncommonly cold  body “rassendyll” interrupted fritz getting down   table  taking my arm “look here” the king lay full length   floor his face  red  his hair   breathed heavily sapt  disrespectful old dog kicked him sharply he did not stir nor  there any break  his breathing i saw  his face  head  wet  water   mine “we’ve spent half  hour  him” said fritz “he drank three times what either  you did” growled sapt i knelt down  felt his pulse it  alarmingly languid  slow we three looked  one another “was  druggedthat last bottle” i asked   whisper “i don’t know” said sapt “we must get  doctor” “there’s none within ten miles   thousand doctors wouldn’t take him  strelsau today i know  look  it he’ll not move  six or seven hours yet” “but  coronation” i cried  horror fritz shrugged his shoulders  i began  see  his habit  most occasions “we must send word  he’s ill”  said “i suppose so” said i old sapt who seemed  fresh   daisy had lit his pipe   puffing hard  it “if he’s not crowned today” said he “i’ll lay  crown he’s never crowned” “but heavens why” “the whole nation’s there  meet him half  armyay  black michael   head shall we send word   king’s drunk” “that he’s ill” said i  correction “ill” echoed sapt   scornful laugh “they know his illnesses too well he’s been ‘ill’ before” “well we must chance what they think” said fritz helplessly “i’ll carry  news  make  best  it” sapt raised his hand “tell me” said he “do you think  king  drugged” “i do” said i “and who drugged him” “that damned hound black michael” said fritz between his teeth “ay” said sapt “that  might not come   crowned rassendyll here doesn’t know our pretty michael what think you fritz  michael no king ready has half strelsau no other candidate as god’s alive man  throne’s lost if  king show himself not  strelsau today i know black michael” “we could carry him there” said i “and  very pretty picture  makes” sneered sapt fritz von tarlenheim buried his face  his hands the king breathed loudly  heavily sapt stirred him again  his foot “the drunken dog”  said “but he’s  elphberg   son  his father  may i rot  hell before black michael sits  his place” for  moment or two we  all silent then sapt knitting his bushy grey brows took his pipe  his mouth  said  me “as  man grows old  believes  fate fate sent you here fate sends you now  strelsau” i staggered back murmuring “good god” fritz looked up   eager bewildered gaze “impossible” i muttered “i should  known” “it’s  riskagainst  certainty” said sapt “if you shave i’ll wager you’ll not  known are you afraid” “sir” “come lad there there but it’s your life you know if you’re knownand mineand fritz’s here but if you don’t go i swear  you black michael  sit tonight   throne   king lie  prison or his grave” “the king would never forgive it” i stammered “are we women who cares  his forgiveness” the clock ticked fifty times  sixty  seventy times  i stood  thought then i suppose  look came over my face  old sapt caught me   hand crying “you’ll go” “yes i’ll go” said i  i turned my eyes   prostrate figure   king   floor “tonight” sapt went    hasty whisper “we   lodge   palace the moment they leave us you  i  mount our horsesfritz must stay there  guard  king’s roomand ride here   gallop the king   readyjosef  tell himand  must ride back  me  strelsau  you ride  if  devil  behind you   frontier” i took  all    second  nodded my head “there’s  chance” said fritz  his first sign  hopefulness “if i escape detection” said i “if we’re detected” said sapt “i’ll send black michael down below before i go myself so help me heaven sit   chair man” i obeyed him he darted   room calling “josef josef” in three minutes   back  josef  him the latter carried  jug  hot water soap  razors he  trembling  sapt told him how  land lay  bade him shave me suddenly fritz smote  his thigh “but  guard they’ll know they’ll know” “pooh we shan’t wait   guard we’ll ride  hofbau  catch  train there when they come  bird’ll  flown” “but  king” “the king     winecellar i’m going  carry him there now” “if they find him” “they won’t how should they josef  put them off” “but” sapt stamped his foot “we’re not playing”  roared “my god don’t i know  risk if they do find him he’s no worse off than if  isn’t crowned today  strelsau” so speaking  flung  door open and stooping put forth  strength i did not dream  had  lifted  king  his hands and   did so  old woman johann  keeper’s mother stood   doorway for  moment she stood then she turned  her heel without  sign  surprise  clattered down  passage “has she heard” cried fritz “i’ll shut her mouth” said sapt grimly   bore off  king  his arms for me i sat down   armchair   i sat there halfdazed josef clipped  scraped me till my moustache  imperial  things   past  my face   bare   king’s and when fritz saw me thus  drew  long breath  exclaimed “by jove we shall do it” it  six o’clock now  we had no time  lose sapt hurried me into  king’s room  i dressed myself   uniform   colonel   guard finding time  i slipped   king’s boots  ask sapt what  had done   old woman “she swore she’d heard nothing” said he “but  make sure i tied her legs together  put  handkerchief  her mouth  bound her hands  locked her up   coalcellar next door   king josef  look after them both later on” then i burst out laughing  even old sapt grimly smiled “i fancy” said he “that when josef tells them  king  gone they’ll think   because we smelt  rat for you may swear black michael doesn’t expect  see him  strelsau today” i put  king’s helmet  my head old sapt handed me  king’s sword looking  me long  carefully “thank god  shaved his beard”  exclaimed “why did he” i asked “because princess flavia said  grazed her cheek when   graciously pleased  give her  cousinly kiss come though we must ride” “is all safe here” “nothing’s safe anywhere” said sapt “but we can make  no safer” fritz now rejoined us   uniform   captain   same regiment    which my dress belonged in four minutes sapt had arrayed himself  his uniform josef called   horses  ready we jumped  their backs  started   rapid trot the game had begun what would  issue   be the cool morning air cleared my head  i  able  take  all sapt said  me he  wonderful fritz hardly spoke riding like  man asleep but sapt without another word   king began  once  instruct me most minutely   history  my past life  my family  my tastes pursuits weaknesses friends companions  servants he told me  etiquette   ruritanian court promising   constantly  my elbow  point out everybody whom i ought  know  give me hints  what degree  favour  greet them “by  way”  said “you’re  catholic i suppose” “not i” i answered “lord he’s  heretic” groaned sapt  forthwith  fell   rudimentary lesson   practices  observances   romish faith “luckily” said he “you won’t  expected  know much   king’s notoriously lax  careless about such matters but you must   civil  butter   cardinal we hope  win him over because   michael have  standing quarrel about their precedence” we   now   station fritz had recovered nerve enough  explain   astonished station master   king had changed his plans the train steamed up we got into  firstclass carriage  sapt leaning back   cushions went   his lesson i looked  my watchthe king’s watch  was  course it  just eight “i wonder if they’ve gone  look  us” i said “i hope they won’t find  king” said fritz nervously  this time   sapt who shrugged his shoulders the train travelled well   halfpast nine looking out   window i saw  towers  spires   great city “your capital my liege” grinned old sapt   wave  his hand and leaning forward  laid his finger  my pulse “a little too quick” said he  his grumbling tone “i’m not made  stone” i exclaimed “you’ll do” said he   nod “we must say fritz here  caught  ague drain your flask fritz  heaven’s sake boy” fritz did    bid “we’re  hour early” said sapt “we’ll send word forward  your majesty’s arrival  there’ll  no one here  meet us yet and meanwhile” “meanwhile” said i “the king’ll  hanged if  doesn’t have some breakfast” old sapt chuckled  held out his hand “you’re  elphberg every inch  you” said he then  paused  looking  us said quietly “god send we may  alive tonight” “amen” said fritz von tarlenheim the train stopped fritz  sapt leapt out uncovered  held  door  me i choked down  lump  rose  my throat settled my helmet firmly  my head  i’m not ashamed  say it breathed  short prayer  god then i stepped   platform   station  strelsau a moment later all  bustle  confusion men hurrying up hats  hand  hurrying off again men conducting me   buffet men mounting  riding  hot haste   quarters   troops   cathedral   residence  duke michael even  i swallowed  last drop  my cup  coffee  bells throughout all  city broke out into  joyful peal   sound   military band   men cheering smote upon my ear king rudolf  fifth   his good city  strelsau and they shouted outside “god save  king” old sapt’s mouth wrinkled into  smile “god save ‘em both”  whispered “courage lad”  i felt his hand press my knee chapter  the adventures   understudy with fritz von tarlenheim  colonel sapt close behind me i stepped out   buffet    platform the last thing i did   feel if my revolver  handy  my sword loose   scabbard a gay group  officers  high dignitaries stood awaiting me  their head  tall old man covered  medals   military bearing he wore  yellow  red ribbon   red rose  ruritaniawhich   way decorated my unworthy breast also “marshal strakencz” whispered sapt  i knew  i    presence   most famous veteran   ruritanian army just behind  marshal stood  short spare man  flowing robes  black  crimson “the chancellor   kingdom” whispered sapt the marshal greeted me   few loyal words  proceeded  deliver  apology   duke  strelsau the duke  seemed had been afflicted   sudden indisposition which made  impossible  him  come   station but  craved leave  await his majesty   cathedral i expressed my concern accepted  marshal’s excuses very suavely  received  compliments   large number  distinguished personages no one betrayed  least suspicion  i felt my nerve returning   agitated beating  my heart subsiding but fritz  still pale  his hand shook like  leaf   extended    marshal presently we formed procession  took our way   door   station here i mounted my horse  marshal holding my stirrup the civil dignitaries went off  their carriages  i started  ride through  streets   marshal  my right  sapt who  my chief aidedecamp  entitled   place  my left the city  strelsau  partly old  partly new spacious modern boulevards  residential quarters surround  embrace  narrow tortuous  picturesque streets   original town in  outer circles  upper classes live   inner  shops  situated and behind their prosperous fronts lie hidden populous but wretched lanes  alleys filled   povertystricken turbulent  in large measure criminal class these social  local divisions corresponded  i knew  sapt’s information  another division more important  me the new town    king but   old town michael  strelsau   hope  hero   darling the scene  very brilliant  we passed along  grand boulevard     great square where  royal palace stood here i    midst  my devoted adherents every house  hung  red  bedecked  flags  mottoes the streets  lined  raised seats  each side  i passed along bowing this way  that under  shower  cheers blessings  waving handkerchiefs the balconies  full  gaily dressed ladies who clapped their hands  curtsied  threw their brightest glances  me a torrent  red roses fell  me one bloom lodged  my horse’s mane  i took   stuck   my coat the marshal smiled grimly i had stolen some glances  his face but   too impassive  show me whether his sympathies   me or not “the red rose   elphbergs marshal” said i gaily   nodded i have written “gaily”   strange word  must seem but  truth is  i  drunk  excitement at  moment i believedi almost believedthat i   very truth  king and   look  laughing triumph i raised my eyes   beautyladen balconies again     then i started for looking down  me  her handsome face  proud smile   lady who had been my fellow travellerantoinette de mauban  i saw her also start  her lips moved  she leant forward  gazed  me and i collecting myself met her eyes full  square while again i felt my revolver suppose she had cried aloud “that’s not  king” well we went by  then  marshal turning round  his saddle waved his hand   cuirassiers closed round us so   crowd could not come near me we  leaving my quarter  entering duke michael’s  this action   marshal’s showed me more clearly than words what  state  feeling   town must be but if fate made me  king  least i could do   play  part handsomely “why this change  our order marshal” said i the marshal bit his white moustache “it  more prudent sire”  murmured i drew rein “let those  front ride on” said i “till they  fifty yards ahead but do you marshal  colonel sapt  my friends wait here till i have ridden fifty yards and see  no one  nearer  me i  have my people see  their king trusts them” sapt laid his hand  my arm i shook him off the marshal hesitated “am i not understood” said i and biting his moustache again  gave  orders i saw old sapt smiling into his beard but  shook his head  me if i had been killed  open day   streets  strelsau sapt’s position would have been  difficult one perhaps i ought  say  i  dressed all  white except my boots i wore  silver helmet  gilt ornaments   broad ribbon   rose looked well across my chest i should  paying  poor compliment   king if i did not set modesty aside  admit  i made  very fine figure so  people thought  when i riding alone entered  dingy sparsely decorated sombre streets   old town there  first  murmur then  cheer   woman   window above  cookshop cried  old local saying “if he’s red he’s right” whereat i laughed  took off my helmet  she might see  i    right colour  they cheered me again  that it  more interesting riding thus alone  i heard  comments   crowd “he looks paler than his wont” said one “you’d look pale if you lived   does”   highly disrespectful retort “he’s  bigger man than i thought” said another “so  had  good jaw under  beard after all” commented  third “the pictures  him aren’t handsome enough” declared  pretty girl taking great care  i should hear no doubt   mere flattery but  spite  these signs  approval  interest  mass   people received me  silence   sullen looks  my dear brother’s portrait ornamented most   windowswhich   ironical sort  greeting   king i  quite glad   had been spared  unpleasant sight he   man  quick temper  perhaps  would not have taken  so placidly  i did at last we    cathedral its great grey front embellished  hundreds  statues  boasting  pair   finest oak doors  europe rose   first time before me   sudden sense  my audacity almost overcame me everything    mist  i dismounted i saw  marshal  sapt dimly  dimly  throng  gorgeously robed priests who awaited me and my eyes  still dim  i walked up  great nave   pealing   organ  my ears i saw nothing   brilliant throng  filled it i hardly distinguished  stately figure   cardinal   rose   archiepiscopal throne  greet me two faces only stood out side  side clearly before my eyesthe face   girl pale  lovely surmounted   crown   glorious elphberg hair for   woman   glorious   face   man whose fullblooded red cheeks black hair  dark deep eyes told me   last i   presence  my brother black michael and when  saw me his red cheeks went pale all   moment  his helmet fell   clatter   floor till  moment i believe   had not realized   king   very truth come  strelsau of what followed next i remember nothing i knelt before  altar   cardinal anointed my head then i rose  my feet  stretched out my hand  took  him  crown  ruritania  set   my head  i swore  old oath   king  if    sin may   forgiven me i received  holy sacrament there before them all then  great organ pealed out again  marshal bade  heralds proclaim me  rudolf  fifth  crowned king  which imposing ceremony  excellent picture hangs now  my diningroom the portrait   king  very good then  lady   pale face   glorious hair her train held  two pages stepped  her place  came  where i stood and  herald cried “her royal highness  princess flavia” she curtsied low  put her hand under mine  raised my hand  kissed it and   instant i thought what i had best do then i drew her  me  kissed her twice   cheek  she blushed red andthen his eminence  cardinal archbishop slipped  front  black michael  kissed my hand  presented me   letter   popethe first  last which i have received   exalted quarter and then came  duke  strelsau his step trembled i swear   looked   right    left   man looks who thinks  flight  his face  patched  red  white  his hand shook so   jumped under mine  i felt his lips dry  parched and i glanced  sapt who  smiling again into his beard and resolutely doing my duty   station  life  which i had been marvellously called i took my dear michael  both hands  kissed him   cheek i think we  both glad when   over but neither   face   princess nor    any other did i see  least doubt or questioning yet had i   king stood side  side she could have told us   instant or  least   little consideration but neither she nor anyone else dreamed or imagined  i could  other than  king so  likeness served    hour i stood there feeling  weary  blase  though i had been  king all my life  everybody kissed my hand   ambassadors paid me their respects among them old lord topham  whose house  grosvenor square i had danced  score  times thank heaven  old man   blind   bat  did not claim my acquaintance then back we went through  streets   palace  i heard them cheering black michael but he fritz told me sat biting his nails like  man   reverie  even his own friends said   should have made  braver show i    carriage now side  side   princess flavia   rough fellow cried out “and when’s  wedding”    spoke another struck him   face crying “long live duke michael”   princess colouredit   admirable tintand looked straight  front  her now i felt   difficulty because i had forgotten  ask sapt  state  my affections or how far matters had gone between  princess  myself frankly had i been  king  further they had gone  better should i have been pleased for i am not  slowblooded man  i had not kissed princess flavia’s cheek  nothing these thoughts passed through my head but not being sure  my ground i said nothing    moment or two  princess recovering her equanimity turned  me “do you know rudolf” said she “you look somehow different today” the fact  not surprising but  remark  disquieting “you look” she went on “more sober more sedate you’re almost careworn  i declare you’re thinner surely it’s not possible  you’ve begun  take anything seriously” the princess seemed  hold   king much  same opinion  lady burlesdon held  me i braced myself up   conversation “would  please you” i asked softly “oh you know my views” said she turning her eyes away “whatever pleases you i try  do” i said and  i saw her smile  blush i thought  i  playing  king’s hand very well  him so i continued  what i said  perfectly true “i assure you my dear cousin  nothing  my life  affected me more than  reception i’ve been greeted  today” she smiled brightly but   instant grew grave again  whispered “did you notice michael” “yes” said i adding “he wasn’t enjoying himself” “do  careful” she went on “you don’tindeed you don’tkeep enough watch  him you know” “i know” said i “that  wants what i’ve got” “yes hush” thenand i can’t justify it  i committed  king far beyond what i had  right  doi suppose she carried me off my feeti went on “and perhaps also something which i haven’t got yet but hope  win some day” this  my answer had i been  king i should have thought  encouraging “haven’t you enough responsibilities  you  one day cousin” bang bang blare blare we    palace guns  firing  trumpets blowing rows  lackeys stood waiting and handing  princess up  broad marble staircase i took formal possession   crowned king   house  my ancestors  sat down  my own table  my cousin  my right hand  her other side black michael   my left his eminence  cardinal behind my chair stood sapt    end   table i saw fritz von tarlenheim drain   bottom his glass  champagne rather sooner than  decently should i wondered what  king  ruritania  doing chapter  the secret   cellar we    king’s dressingroomfritz von tarlenheim sapt  i i flung myself exhausted into  armchair sapt lit his pipe he uttered no congratulations   marvellous success  our wild risk but his whole bearing  eloquent  satisfaction the triumph aided perhaps  good wine had made  new man  fritz “what  day  you  remember”  cried “gad i’d like   king  twelve hours myself but rassendyll you mustn’t throw your heart too much into  part i don’t wonder black michael looked blacker than everyou   princess had so much  say  one another” “how beautiful she is” i exclaimed “never mind  woman” growled sapt “are you ready  start” “yes” said i   sigh it  five o’clock   twelve i should  no more than rudolf rassendyll i remarked     joking tone “you’ll  lucky” observed sapt grimly “if you’re not  late rudolf rassendyll by heaven i feel my head wobbling  my shoulders every minute you’re   city do you know friend  michael  had news  zenda he went into  room alone  read itand  came out looking like  man dazed” “i’m ready” said i this news making me none  more eager  linger sapt sat down “i must write us  order  leave  city michael’s governor you know  we must  prepared  hindrances you must sign  order” “my dear colonel i’ve not been bred  forger” out  his pocket sapt produced  piece  paper “there’s  king’s signature”  said “and here”  went on after another search  his pocket “is some tracing paper if you can’t manage  ‘rudolf’  ten minutes whyi can” “your education  been more comprehensive than mine” said i “you write it” and  very tolerable forgery did this versatile hero produce “now fritz” said he “the king goes  bed he  upset no one   see him till nine o’clock tomorrow you understandno one” “i understand” answered fritz “michael may come  claim immediate audience you’ll answer  only princes   blood  entitled  it” “that’ll annoy michael” laughed fritz “you quite understand” asked sapt again “if  door  this room  opened while we’re away you’re not   alive  tell us about it” “i need no schooling colonel” said fritz  trifle haughtily “here wrap yourself  this big cloak” sapt continued  me “and put  this flat cap my orderly rides  me   huntinglodge tonight” “there’s  obstacle” i observed “the horse doesn’t live  can carry me forty miles” “oh yes  doestwo  him one hereone   lodge now  you ready” “i’m ready” said i fritz held out his hand “in case” said he  we shook hands heartily “damn your sentiment” growled sapt “come along” he went not   door but   panel   wall “in  old king’s time” said he “i knew this way well” i followed him  we walked  i should estimate near two hundred yards along  narrow passage then we came   stout oak door sapt unlocked it we passed through  found ourselves   quiet street  ran along  back   palace gardens a man  waiting  us  two horses one   magnificent bay up  any weight  other  sturdy brown sapt signed  me  mount  bay without  word   man we mounted  rode away the town  full  noise  merriment but we took secluded ways my cloak  wrapped over half my face  capacious flat cap hid every lock  my telltale hair by sapt’s directions i crouched  my saddle  rode  such  round back  i hope never  exhibit   horse again down  long narrow lane we went meeting some wanderers  some roisterers and  we rode we heard  cathedral bells still clanging out their welcome   king it  halfpast six  still light at last we came   city wall    gate “have your weapon ready” whispered sapt “we must stop his mouth if  talks” i put my hand  my revolver sapt hailed  doorkeeper the stars fought  us a little girl  fourteen tripped out “please sir father’s gone  see  king” “he’d better have stayed here” said sapt  me grinning “but  said i wasn’t  open  gate sir” “did he my dear” said sapt dismounting “then give me  key” the key    child’s hand sapt gave her  crown “here’s  order   king show   your father orderly open  gate” i leapt down between us we rolled back  great gate led our horses out  closed  again “i shall  sorry   doorkeeper if michael finds out   wasn’t there now then lad   canter we mustn’t go too fast while we’re near  town” once however outside  city we ran little danger  everybody else  inside merrymaking    evening fell we quickened our pace my splendid horse bounding along under me  though i had been  feather it   fine night  presently  moon appeared we talked little   way  chiefly about  progress we  making “i wonder what  duke’s despatches told him” said i once “ay i wonder” responded sapt we stopped   draught  wine   bait our horses losing half  hour thus i dared not go into  inn  stayed   horses   stable then we went ahead again  had covered some fiveandtwenty miles when sapt abruptly stopped “hark”  cried i listened away far behind us   still   eveningit  just halfpast ninewe heard  beat  horses’ hoofs the wind blowing strong behind us carried  sound i glanced  sapt “come on”  cried  spurred his horse into  gallop when we next paused  listen  hoofbeats  not audible  we relaxed our pace then we heard them again sapt jumped down  laid his ear   ground “there  two”  said “they’re only  mile behind thank god  road curves   out   wind’s our way” we galloped on we seemed   holding our own we had entered  outskirts   forest  zenda   trees closing  behind us   track zigged  zagged prevented us seeing our pursuers  them  seeing us another halfhour brought us   divide   road sapt drew rein “to  right  our road”  said “to  left   castle each about eight miles get down” “but they’ll   us” i cried “get down”  repeated brusquely  i obeyed the wood  dense up   very edge   road we led our horses into  covert bound handkerchiefs over their eyes  stood beside them “you want  see who they are” i whispered “ay  where they’re going”  answered i saw  his revolver   his hand nearer  nearer came  hoofs the moon shone out now clear  full so   road  white  it the ground  hard  we had left no traces “here they come” whispered sapt “it’s  duke” “i thought so”  answered it   duke   him  burly fellow whom i knew well  who had cause  know me afterwardsmax holf brother  johann  keeper  bodyservant  his highness they  up  us  duke reined up i saw sapt’s finger curl lovingly towards  trigger i believe  would have given ten years  his life   shot   could have picked off black michael  easily  i could  barndoor fowl   farmyard i laid my hand  his arm he nodded reassuringly   always ready  sacrifice inclination  duty “which way” asked black michael “to  castle your highness” urged his companion “there we shall learn  truth” for  instant  duke hesitated “i thought i heard hoofs” said he “i think not your highness” “why shouldn’t we go   lodge” “i fear  trap if all  well why go   lodge if not it’s  snare  trap us” suddenly  duke’s horse neighed in  instant we folded our cloaks close round our horses’ heads and holding them thus covered  duke  his attendant  our revolvers if they had found us they had been dead men or our prisoners michael waited  moment longer then  cried “to zenda then”  setting spurs  his horse galloped on sapt raised his weapon after him  there  such  expression  wistful regret  his face  i had much ado not  burst out laughing for ten minutes we stayed where we were “you see” said sapt “they’ve sent him news  all  well” “what does  mean” i asked “god knows” said sapt frowning heavily “but it’s brought him  strelsau   rare puzzle” then we mounted  rode  fast  our weary horses could lay their feet   ground for those last eight miles we spoke no more our minds  full  apprehension “all  well” what did  mean was all well   king at last  lodge came  sight spurring our horses   last gallop we rode up   gate all  still  quiet not  soul came  meet us we dismounted  haste suddenly sapt caught me   arm “look there”  said pointing   ground i looked down at my feet lay five or six silk handkerchiefs torn  slashed  rent i turned  him questioningly “they’re what i tied  old woman up with” said he “fasten  horses  come along” the handle   door turned without resistance we passed into  room which had been  scene  last night’s bout it  still strewn   remnants  our meal   empty bottles “come on” cried sapt whose marvellous composure had  last almost given way we rushed down  passage towards  cellars the door   coalcellar stood wide open “they found  old woman” said i “you might have known    handkerchiefs”  said then we came opposite  door   winecellar it  shut it looked  all respects   had looked when we left   morning “come it’s all right” said i a loud oath  sapt rang out his face turned pale   pointed again   floor from under  door  red stain had spread over  floor   passage  dried there sapt sank against  opposite wall i tried  door it  locked “where’s josef” muttered sapt “where’s  king” i responded sapt took out  flask  put   his lips i ran back   diningroom  seized  heavy poker   fireplace in my terror  excitement i rained blows   lock   door  i fired  cartridge into it it gave way   door swung open “give me  light” said i but sapt still leant against  wall he was  course more moved than i   loved his master afraid  himself   notno man ever saw him that but  think what might lie   dark cellar  enough  turn any man’s face pale i went myself  took  silver candlestick   diningtable  struck  light and  i returned i felt  hot wax drip  my naked hand   candle swayed   fro so  i cannot afford  despise colonel sapt  his agitation i came   door   cellar the red stain turning more  more   dull brown stretched inside i walked two yards into  cellar  held  candle high above my head i saw  full bins  wine i saw spiders crawling   walls i saw too  couple  empty bottles lying   floor  then away   corner i saw  body   man lying flat  his back  his arms stretched wide   crimson gash across his throat i walked  him  knelt down beside him  commended  god  soul   faithful man for    body  josef  little servant slain  guarding  king i felt  hand  my shoulders and turning saw sapt eyes glaring  terrorstruck beside me “the king my god  king”  whispered hoarsely i threw  candle’s gleam over every inch   cellar “the king  not here” said i chapter  his majesty sleeps  strelsau i put my arm round sapt’s waist  supported him out   cellar drawing  battered door close after me for ten minutes or more we sat silent   diningroom then old sapt rubbed his knuckles into his eyes gave one great gasp   himself again as  clock   mantelpiece struck one  stamped his foot   floor saying “they’ve got  king” “yes” said i “‘all’s well’  black michael’s despatch said what  moment  must have been  him when  royal salutes fired  strelsau this morning i wonder when  got  message” “it must have been sent   morning” said sapt “they must have sent  before news  your arrival  strelsau reached zendai suppose  came  zenda” “and he’s carried  about all day” i exclaimed “upon my honour i’m not  only man who’s had  trying day what did  think sapt” “what does  matter what does  think lad now” i rose  my feet “we must get back” i said “and rouse every soldier  strelsau we ought    pursuit  michael before midday” old sapt pulled out his pipe  carefully lit    candle which guttered   table “the king may  murdered while we sit here” i urged sapt smoked    moment  silence “that cursed old woman”  broke out “she must have attracted their attention somehow i see  game they came up  kidnap  king andas i saysomehow they found him if you hadn’t gone  strelsau you  i  fritz had been  heaven  now” “and  king” “who knows where  king  now”  asked “come let’s  off” said i but  sat still and suddenly  burst into one  his grating chuckles “by jove we’ve shaken up black michael” “come come” i repeated impatiently “and we’ll shake him up  bit more”  added  cunning smile broadening  his wrinkled weatherbeaten face  his teeth working   end  his grizzled moustache “ay lad we’ll go back  strelsau the king shall   his capital again tomorrow” “the king” “the crowned king” “you’re mad” i cried “if we go back  tell  trick we played what would you give  our lives” “just what they’re worth” said i “and   king’s throne do you think   nobles   people  enjoy being fooled  you’ve fooled them do you think they’ll love  king who  too drunk   crowned  sent  servant  personate him” “he  druggedand i’m no servant” “mine   black michael’s version” he rose came  me  laid his hand  my shoulder “lad”  said “if you play  man you may save  king yet go back  keep his throne warm  him” “but  duke knowsthe villains   employed know” “ay but they can’t speak” roared sapt  grim triumph “we’ve got ‘em how can they denounce you without denouncing themselves this  not  king because we kidnapped  king  murdered his servant can they say that” the position flashed  me whether michael knew me or not  could not speak unless  produced  king what could  do and if  produced  king where  he for  moment i  carried away headlong but   instant  difficulties came strong upon me “i must  found out” i urged “perhaps but every hour’s something above all we must have  king  strelsau or  city   michael’s  fourandtwenty hours  what would  king’s life  worth thenor his throne lad you must do it” “suppose they kill  king” “they’ll kill him if you don’t” “sapt suppose they have killed  king” “then  heaven you’re  good  elphberg  black michael  you shall reign  ruritania but i don’t believe they have nor  they kill him if you’re   throne will they kill him  put you in” it   wild planwilder even  more hopeless than  trick we had already carried through but  i listened  sapt i saw  strong points  our game and then i   young man  i loved action  i  offered such  hand  such  game  perhaps never man played yet “i shall  found out” i said “perhaps” said sapt “come  strelsau we shall  caught like rats   trap if we stay here” “sapt” i cried “i’ll try it” “well played” said he “i hope they’ve left us  horses i’ll go  see” “we must bury  poor fellow” said i “no time” said sapt “i’ll do it” “hang you”  grinned “i make you  king andwell do it go  fetch him while i look   horses he can’t lie very deep but i doubt if he’ll care about that poor little josef he   honest bit   man” he went out  i went   cellar i raised poor josef  my arms  bore him into  passage  thence towards  door   house just inside i laid him down remembering  i must find spades  our task at this instant sapt came up “the horses  all right there’s  own brother   one  brought you here but you may save yourself  job” “i’ll not go before he’s buried” “yes you will” “not i colonel sapt not  all ruritania” “you fool” said he “come here” he drew me   door the moon  sinking but about three hundred yards away coming along  road  zenda i made out  party  men there  seven or eight  them four   horseback   rest  walking  i saw  they carried long implements which i guessed   spades  mattocks  their shoulders “they’ll save you  trouble” said sapt “come along” he  right the approaching party must beyond doubt  duke michael’s men come  remove  traces  their evil work i hesitated no longer but  irresistible desire seized me pointing   corpse  poor little josef i said  sapt “colonel we ought  strike  blow  him” “you’d like  give him some company eh but it’s too risky work your majesty” “i must have  slap  ‘em” said i sapt wavered “well” said he “it’s not business you know but you’ve been good boyand if we come  grief why hang me it’ll save us lot  thinking i’ll show you how  touch them” he cautiously closed  open chink   door then we retreated through  house  made our way   back entrance here our horses  standing a carriagedrive swept all round  lodge “revolver ready” asked sapt “no steel  me” said i “gad you’re thirsty tonight” chuckled sapt “so  it” we mounted drawing our swords  waited silently   minute or two then we heard  tramp  men   drive  other side   house they came   stand  one cried “now then fetch him out” “now” whispered sapt driving  spurs into our horses we rushed   gallop round  house    moment we  among  ruffians sapt told me afterwards   killed  man  i believe him but i saw no more  him with  cut i split  head   fellow   brown horse   fell   ground then i found myself opposite  big man  i  half conscious  another  my right it  too warm  stay    simultaneous action i drove my spurs into my horse again  my sword full into  big man’s breast his bullet whizzed past my eari could almost swear  touched it i wrenched   sword but  would not come  i dropped   galloped after sapt whom i now saw about twenty yards ahead i waved my hand  farewell  dropped   second later   yell   bullet had grazed my finger  i felt  blood old sapt turned round   saddle someone fired again but they had no rifles  we  out  range sapt fell  laughing “that’s one  me  two  you  decent luck” said he “little josef  have company” “ay they’ll   partie carree” said i my blood  up  i rejoiced  have killed them “well  pleasant night’s work   rest” said he “i wonder if they noticed you” “the big fellow did  i stuck him i heard him cry ‘the king’” “good good oh we’ll give black michael some work before we’ve done” pausing  instant we made  bandage  my wounded finger which  bleeding freely  ached severely  bone being much bruised then we rode on asking  our good horses all    them the excitement   fight   our great resolve died away  we rode  gloomy silence day broke clear  cold we found  farmer just up  made him give us sustenance  ourselves  our horses i feigning  toothache muffled my face closely then ahead again till strelsau lay before us it  eight o’clock or nearing nine   gates  all open  they always  save when  duke’s caprice or intrigues shut them we rode    same way  we had come out  evening before all four  usthe men   horseswearied  jaded the streets  even quieter than when we had gone everyone  sleeping off last night’s revelry  we met hardly  soul till we reached  little gate   palace there sapt’s old groom  waiting  us “is all well sir”  asked “all’s well” said sapt   man coming  me took my hand  kiss “the king’s hurt”  cried “it’s nothing” said i  i dismounted “i caught my finger   door” “remembersilence” said sapt “ah but my good freyler i do not need  tell you that” the old fellow shrugged his shoulders “all young men like  ride abroad now  again why not  king” said he  sapt’s laugh left his opinion  my motives undisturbed “you should always trust  man” observed sapt fitting  key   lock “just  far  you must” we went   reached  dressingroom flinging open  door we saw fritz von tarlenheim stretched fully dressed   sofa he seemed  have been sleeping but our entry woke him he leapt  his feet gave one glance  me    joyful cry threw himself  his knees before me “thank god sire thank god you’re safe”  cried stretching his hand up  catch hold  mine i confess  i  moved this king whatever his faults made people love him for  moment i could not bear  speak or break  poor fellow’s illusion but tough old sapt had no such feeling he slapped his hand  his thigh delightedly “bravo lad” cried he “we shall do” fritz looked up  bewilderment i held out my hand “you’re wounded sire”  exclaimed “it’s only  scratch” said i “but” i paused he rose  his feet   bewildered air holding my hand  looked me up  down  down  up then suddenly  dropped my hand  reeled back “where’s  king where’s  king”  cried “hush you fool” hissed sapt “not so loud here’s  king” a knock sounded   door sapt seized me   hand “here quick   bedroom off  your cap  boots get into bed cover everything up” i did  i  bid a moment later sapt looked in nodded grinned  introduced  extremely smart  deferential young gentleman who came up  my bedside bowing again  again  informed me      household   princess flavia   her royal highness had sent him especially  enquire how  king’s health  after  fatigues which his majesty had undergone yesterday “my best thanks sir  my cousin” said i “and tell her royal highness  i  never better  my life” “the king” added old sapt who i began  find loved  good lie   own sake “has slept without  break all night” the young gentleman he reminded me  “osric”  hamlet bowed himself out again the farce  over  fritz von tarlenheim’s pale face recalled us  realitythough  faith  farce had   reality  us now “is  king dead”  whispered “please god no” said i “but he’s   hands  black michael” chapter  a fair cousin   dark brother a real king’s life  perhaps  hard one but  pretended king’s is i warrant much harder on  next day sapt instructed me  my dutieswhat i ought  do  what i ought  knowfor three hours then i snatched breakfast  sapt still opposite me telling me   king always took white wine   morning   known  detest all highly seasoned dishes then came  chancellor  another three hours   him i had  explain   hurt  my finger we turned  bullet  happy account prevented me  writingwhence arose great todo hunting  precedents  so forth ending  my “making my mark”   chancellor attesting    superfluity  solemn oaths then  french ambassador  introduced  present his credentials here my ignorance   no importance   king would have been equally raw   business we worked through  whole corps diplomatique   next few days  demise   crown necessitating all this bother then  last i  left alone i called my new servant we had chosen  succeed poor josef  young man who had never known  king had  brandyandsoda brought  me  observed  sapt  i trusted  i might now have  rest fritz von tarlenheim  standing by “by heaven”  cried “we waste time aren’t we going  throw black michael   heels” “gently my son gently” said sapt knitting his brows “it would   pleasure but  might cost us dear would michael fall  leave  king alive” “and” i suggested “while  king  here  strelsau  his throne what grievance   against his dear brother michael” “are we  do nothing then” “we’re  do nothing stupid” growled sapt “in fact fritz” said i “i am reminded   situation  one  our english playsthe critichave you heard  it or if you like  two men each covering  other   revolver for i can’t expose michael without exposing myself” “and  king” put  sapt “and hang me if michael won’t expose himself if  tries  expose me” “it’s very pretty” said old sapt “if i’m found out” i pursued “i  make  clean breast  it  fight  out   duke but  present i’m waiting   move  him” “he’ll kill  king” said fritz “not he” said sapt “half   six   strelsau” said fritz “only half you’re sure” asked sapt eagerly “yesonly half” “then  king’s alive   other three  guarding him” cried sapt “yesyou’re right” exclaimed fritz his face brightening “if  king  dead  buried they’d all  here  michael you know michael’s back colonel” “i know curse him” “gentlemen gentlemen” said i “who   six” “i think you’ll make their acquaintance soon” said sapt “they  six gentlemen whom michael maintains  his household they belong  him body  soul there  three ruritanians then there’s  frenchman  belgian  one  your countrymen” “they’d all cut  throat if michael told them” said fritz “perhaps they’ll cut mine” i suggested “nothing more likely” agreed sapt “who  here fritz” “de gautet bersonin  detchard” “the foreigners it’s  plain   pikestaff he’s brought them  left  ruritanians   king that’s because  wants  commit  ruritanians  deep   can” “they  none  them among our friends   lodge then” i asked “i wish they had been” said sapt wistfully “they had been not six but four  now” i had already developed one attribute  royaltya feeling  i need not reveal all my mind or my secret designs even  my intimate friends i had fully resolved  my course  action i meant  make myself  popular  i could    same time  show no disfavour  michael by these means i hoped  allay  hostility  his adherents  make  appear if  open conflict came about    ungrateful  not oppressed yet  open conflict  not what i hoped for the king’s interest demanded secrecy  while secrecy lasted i had  fine game  play  strelsau michael should not grow stronger  delay i ordered my horse and attended  fritz von tarlenheim rode   grand new avenue   royal park returning all  salutes which i received  punctilious politeness then i rode through  few   streets stopped  bought flowers   pretty girl paying her   piece  gold  then having attracted  desired amount  attention for i had  trail  half  thousand people after me i rode   residence   princess flavia  asked if she would receive me this step created much interest   met  shouts  approval the princess  very popular   chancellor himself had not scrupled  hint  me   more i pressed my suit   more rapidly i brought    prosperous conclusion  stronger should i    affection  my subjects the chancellor  course did not understand  difficulties which lay   way  following his loyal  excellent advice however i thought i could do no harm  calling   this view fritz supported me   cordiality  surprised me until  confessed   also had his motives  liking  visit   princess’s house which motive  no other than  great desire  see  princess’s ladyinwaiting  bosom friend  countess helga von strofzin etiquette seconded fritz’s hopes while i  ushered into  princess’s room  remained   countess   antechamber  spite   people  servants who  hanging about i doubt not  they managed  teteatete but i had no leisure  think  them  i  playing  most delicate move  all my difficult game i had  keep  princess devoted  meand yet indifferent  me i had  show affection  herand not feel it i had  make love  another     girl whoprincess or no princesswas  most beautiful i had ever seen well i braced myself   task made no easier   charming embarrassment  which i  received how i succeeded  carrying out my programme  appear hereafter “you  gaining golden laurels” she said “you  like  prince  shakespeare who  transformed  becoming king but i’m forgetting you  king sire” “i ask you  speak nothing but what your heart tells youand  call me nothing but my name” she looked  me   moment “then i’m glad  proud rudolf” said she “why  i told you your very face  changed” i acknowledged  compliment but i disliked  topic so i said “my brother  back i hear he made  excursion didn’t he” “yes   here” she said frowning  little “he can’t stay long  strelsau  seems” i observed smiling “well we  all glad  see him the nearer  is  better” the princess glanced  me   gleam  amusement  her eyes “why cousin is   you can” “see better what he’s doing perhaps” said i “and why  you glad” “i didn’t say i  glad” she answered “some people say so  you” “there  many insolent people” she said  delightful haughtiness “possibly you mean  i am one” “your majesty could not be” she said curtseying  feigned deference but adding mischievously after  pause “unless  is” “well unless what” “unless you tell me  i mind  snap  my fingers where  duke  strelsau is” really i wished  i had been  king “you don’t care where cousin michael” “ah cousin michael i call him  duke  strelsau” “you call him michael when you meet him” “yesby  orders  your father” “i see and now  mine” “if those  your orders” “oh decidedly we must all  pleasant  our dear michael” “you order me  receive his friends too i suppose” “the six” “you call them that too” “to    fashion i do but i order you  receive no one unless you like” “except yourself” “i pray  myself i could not order” as i spoke there came  cheer   street the princess ran   window “it  he” she cried “it isthe duke  strelsau” i smiled but said nothing she returned  her seat for  few moments we sat  silence the noise outside subsided but i heard  tread  feet   anteroom i began  talk  general subjects this went   some minutes i wondered what had become  michael but  did not seem    me  interfere all  once  my great surprise flavia clasping her hands asked   agitated voice “are you wise  make him angry” “what who how am i making him angry” “why  keeping him waiting” “my dear cousin i don’t want  keep him” “well then    come in” “of course if you wish it” she looked  me curiously “how funny you are” she said “of course no one could  announced while i   you” here   charming attribute  royalty “an excellent etiquette” i cried “but i had clean forgotten it  if i  alone  someone else couldn’t you  announced” “you know  well  i do i could be because i am   blood”  she still looked puzzled “i never could remember all these silly rules” said i rather feebly  i inwardly cursed fritz  not posting me up “but i’ll repair my fault” i jumped up flung open  door  advanced into  anteroom michael  sitting   table  heavy frown  his face everyone else  standing save  impudent young dog fritz who  lounging easily   armchair  flirting   countess helga he leapt up  i entered   deferential alacrity  lent point  his former nonchalance i had no difficulty  understanding   duke might not like young fritz i held out my hand michael took it  i embraced him then i drew him  me into  inner room “brother” i said “if i had known you  here you should not have waited  moment before i asked  princess  permit me  bring you  her” he thanked me but coldly the man had many qualities but  could not hide his feelings a mere stranger could have seen   hated me  hated worse  see me  princess flavia yet i am persuaded   tried  conceal both feelings and further   tried  persuade me   believed i  verily  king i did not know  course but unless  king   impostor  once cleverer  more audacious than i and i began  think something  myself   role michael could not believe that and if  didn’t how  must have loathed paying me deference  hearing my “michael”  my “flavia” “your hand  hurt sire”  observed  concern “yes i  playing  game   mongrel dog” i meant  stir him “and you know brother such have uncertain tempers” he smiled sourly  his dark eyes rested  me   moment “but  there no danger   bite” cried flavia anxiously “none  this” said i “if i gave him  chance  bite deeper  would  different cousin” “but surely   been destroyed” said she “not yet we’re waiting  see if his bite  harmful” “and if  is” asked michael  his sour smile “he’ll  knocked   head brother” said i “you won’t play  him any more” urged flavia “perhaps i shall” “he might bite again” “doubtless he’ll try” said i smiling then fearing michael would say something which i must appear  resent for though i might show him my hate i must seem   full  favour i began  compliment him   magnificent condition  his regiment   their loyal greeting  me   day  my coronation thence i passed   rapturous description   huntinglodge which  had lent me but  rose suddenly  his feet his temper  failing him and   excuse  said farewell however   reached  door  stopped saying “three friends  mine  very anxious  have  honour  being presented  you sire they  here   antechamber” i joined him directly passing my arm through his the look  his face  honey  me we entered  antechamber  fraternal fashion michael beckoned  three men came forward “these gentlemen” said michael   stately courtesy which  do him justice  could assume  perfect grace  ease “are  loyalest  most devoted  your majesty’s servants   my very faithful  attached friends” “on  last ground  much   first” said i “i am very pleased  see them” they came one  one  kissed my handde gautet  tall lean fellow  hair

hid  smile   instant “so mr detchard    secret” thought i having got rid  my dear brother  his friends i returned  make my adieu  my cousin she  standing   door i bade her farewell taking her hand  mine “rudolf” she said very low “be careful won’t you” “of what” “you knowi can’t say but think what your life  to” “well to” “to ruritania” was i right  play  part or wrong  play  part i know not evil lay both ways  i dared not tell her  truth “only  ruritania” i asked softly a sudden flush spread over her incomparable face “to your friends too” she said “friends” “and  your cousin” she whispered “and loving servant” i could not speak i kissed her hand  went out cursing myself outside i found master fritz quite reckless   footmen playing  cat’scradle   countess helga “hang it” said he “we can’t always  plotting love claims his share” “i’m inclined  think  does” said i  fritz who had been  my side dropped respectfully behind chapter  a new use   teatable if i   detail  ordinary

i’ve some news  you first” “what’s that” “the king’s   castle  zenda” said he “how do you know” “because  other half  michael’s six  there i had enquiries made  they’re all therelauengram krafstein  young rupert hentzau three rogues too  my honour  fine  live  ruritania” “well” “well fritz wants you  march   castle  horse foot  artillery” “and drag  moat” i asked “that would  about it” grinned sapt “and we shouldn’t find  king’s body then” “you think it’s certain he’s there” “very probable besides  fact  those three being there  drawbridge  kept up  no one goes  without  order  young hentzau or black michael himself we must tie fritz up” “i’ll go  zenda” said i “you’re mad” “some day” “oh perhaps you’ll very likely stay there though if you do” “that may be my friend” said i carelessly “his majesty looks sulky” observed sapt “how’s  love affair” “damn you hold your tongue” i said he looked  me   moment then  lit his pipe it  quite true  i    bad temper  i went  perversely “wherever i go i’m dogged  half  dozen fellows” “i know you are i send ‘em”  replied composedly “what for” “well” said sapt puffing away “it wouldn’t  exactly inconvenient  black michael if you

“consult colonel sapt” “eh” exclaimed  gentleman genuinely astonished “does she take me   greater fool than you” i waved  him   silent “ask him what woman would do most  prevent  duke  marrying his cousin  therefore most  prevent him becoming king and ask if her name begins witha” i sprang  my feet sapt laid down his pipe “antoinette de mauban  heaven” i cried “how do you know” asked sapt i told him what i knew   lady  how i knew it he nodded “it’s so far true  she’s had  great row  michael” said he thoughtfully “if she would she could  useful” i said “i believe though  michael wrote  letter” “so do i but i mean  know  certain i shall go sapt” “no i shall go” said he “you may go  far   gate” “i shall go   summerhouse” “i’m hanged if you shall” i rose  leant my back against  mantelpiece “sapt i believe   woman  i shall go” “i don’t believe  any woman” said sapt “and you shan’t go” “i either go   summerhouse or back  england” said i sapt began  know exactly how far  could lead or drive  when  must follow “we’re playing against time” i added “every day we leave  king where   there  fresh risk every day i masquerade like this there  fresh risk sapt we must play high we must force  game” “so  it”  said   sigh to cut  story short  halfpast eleven  night sapt  i mounted our horses fritz  again left  guard our destination not being revealed  him it   very dark night i wore no sword but i carried  revolver  long knife   bull’seye lantern we arrived outside  gate i dismounted sapt held out his hand “i shall wait here”  said “if i hear  shot i’ll” “stay where you are it’s  king’s only chance you mustn’t come  grief too” “you’re right lad good luck” i pressed  little gate it yielded  i found myself   wild sort  shrubbery there   grassgrown path and turning   right  i had been bidden i followed  cautiously my lantern  closed  revolver   my hand i heard not  sound presently  large dark object loomed out   gloom ahead  me it   summerhouse reaching  steps i mounted them  found myself confronted   weak rickety wooden door which hung upon  latch i pushed  open  walked in a woman flew  me  seized my hand “shut  door” she whispered i obeyed  turned  light  my lantern  her she   evening dress arrayed very sumptuously  her dark striking beauty  marvellously displayed   glare   bull’seye the summerhouse   bare little room furnished only   couple  chairs   small iron table such  one sees   tea garden or  openair cafe “don’t talk” she said “we’ve no time listen i know you mr rassendyll i wrote  letter   duke’s orders” “so i thought” said i “in twenty minutes three men   here  kill you” “threethe three” “yes you must  gone  then if not tonight you’ll  killed” “or they will” “listen listen when you’re killed your body   taken   low quarter   town it   found there

never camethat you saw through  trick” i took her hand  kissed it “madame” said i “you have served  king well tonight where     castle” she sank her voice   fearful whisper i listened eagerly “across  drawbridge you come   heavy door behind  lieshark what’s that” there  steps outside “they’re coming they’re too soon heavens they’re too soon”  she turned pale  death “they seem  me” said i “to    nick  time” “close your lantern see there’s  chink   door can you see them” i put my eye   chink on  lowest step i saw three dim figures i cocked my revolver antoinette hastily laid her hand  mine “you may kill one” said she “but what then” a voice came  outsidea voice  spoke perfect english “mr rassendyll”  said i made no answer “we want  talk  you will you promise not  shoot till we’ve done” “have i  pleasure  addressing mr detchard” i said “never mind names” “then let mine alone” “all right sire i’ve  offer  you” i still had my eye   chink the three had mounted two steps more three revolvers pointed full   door “will you let us in we pledge our honour  observe  truce” “don’t trust them” whispered antoinette “we can speak through  door” said i “but you might open   fire” objected detchard “and though we should finish you you might finish one  us will you give your honour not  fire while we talk” “don’t trust them” whispered antoinette again a sudden idea struck me i considered    moment it seemed feasible “i give my honour not  fire before you do” said i “but i won’t let you in stand outside  talk” “that’s sensible”  said the three mounted  last step  stood just outside  door i laid my ear   chink i could hear no words but detchard’s head  close     taller  his companions de gautet i guessed “h’m private communications” thought i then i said aloud “well gentlemen what’s  offer” “a safeconduct   frontier  fifty thousand pounds english” “no no” whispered antoinette   lowest  whispers “they  treacherous” “that seems handsome” said i reconnoitering through  chink they  all close together just outside  door now i had probed  hearts   ruffians  i did not need antoinette’s warning they meant  “rush” me  soon  i  engaged  talk “give me  minute  consider” said i  i thought i heard  laugh outside i turned  antoinette “stand up close   wall out   line  fire   door” i whispered “what  you going  do” she asked  fright “you’ll see” said i i took up  little iron table it  not very heavy   man  my strength  i held    legs the top protruding  front  me made  complete screen  my head  body i fastened my closed lantern  my belt  put my revolver   handy pocket suddenly i saw  door move ever so slightlyperhaps    wind perhaps    hand trying  outside i drew back  far  i could   door holding  table   position  i have described then i called out “gentlemen i accept your offer relying  your honour if you  open  door” “open  yourself” said detchard “it opens outwards” said i “stand back  little gentlemen or i shall hit you when i open it” i went  fumbled   latch then i stole back  my place  tiptoe “i can’t open it” i cried “the latch  caught” “tut i’ll open it” cried detchard “nonsense bersonin why not are you afraid  one man” i smiled  myself an instant later  door  flung back the gleam   lantern showed me  three close together outside their revolvers levelled with  shout i charged  my utmost pace across  summerhouse  through  doorway three shots rang out  battered into my shield another moment  i leapt out   table caught them full  square    tumbling swearing struggling mass they  i   brave table rolled down  steps   summerhouse   ground below antoinette de mauban shrieked but i rose  my feet laughing aloud de gautet  bersonin lay like men stunned detchard  under  table but  i rose  pushed   him  fired again i raised my revolver  took  snap shot i heard him curse  then i ran like  hare laughing  i went past  summerhouse  along   wall i heard steps behind me  turning round i fired again  luck the steps ceased “please god” said i “she told me  truth about  ladder”   wall  high  topped  iron spikes yes there  was i  up  over   minute doubling back i saw  horses then i heard  shot it  sapt he had heard us   battling  raging   locked gate hammering   firing into  keyhole like  man possessed he had quite forgotten    not  take part   fight whereat i laughed again  said  i clapped him   shoulder “come home  bed old chap i’ve got  finest teatable story  ever you heard” he started  cried “you’re safe”  wrung my hand but  moment later  added “and what  devil  you laughing at” “four gentlemen round  teatable” said i laughing still   had been uncommonly ludicrous  see  formidable three altogether routed  scattered  no more deadly weapon than  ordinary teatable moreover you  observe  i had honourably kept my word  not fired till they did chapter  a great chance   villain it   custom   prefect  police should send every afternoon  report  me   condition   capital   feeling   people  document included also  account   movements  any persons whom  police had received instructions  watch since i had been  strelsau sapt had been   habit  reading  report  telling me any items  interest which  might contain on  day after my adventure   summerhouse  came   i  playing  hand  ecarte  fritz von tarlenheim “the report  rather full  interest this afternoon”  observed sitting down “do you find” i asked “any mention   certain fracas” he shook his head   smile “i find this first”  said “‘his highness  duke  strelsau left  city so far   appears suddenly accompanied  several  his household his destination  believed    castle  zenda but

voice “you must make love  her tonight you know” “i think   very likely i shall if i see her alone” said i “hang it sapt you don’t suppose i find  difficult” fritz whistled  bar or two then  said “you’ll find  only too easy look here i hate telling you this but i must the countess helga told me   princess had become most attached   king since  coronation her feelings have undergone  marked development it’s quite true  she  deeply wounded   king’s apparent neglect” “here’s  kettle  fish” i groaned “tut tut” said sapt “i suppose you’ve made pretty speeches   girl before now that’s all she wants” fritz himself  lover understood better my distress he laid his hand  my shoulder but said nothing “i think though” pursued  coldblooded old sapt “that you’d better make your offer tonight” “good heavens” “or any rate go near it  i shall send  ‘semiofficial’   papers” “i’ll do nothing   sortno more  you” said i “i utterly refuse  take part  making  fool   princess” sapt looked  me  his small keen eyes a slow cunning smile passed over his face “all right lad all right” said he “we mustn’t press you too hard soothe her down  bit if you can you know now  michael” “oh damn michael” said i “he’ll do tomorrow here fritz come   stroll   garden” sapt  once yielded his rough manner covered  wonderful tactand  i came  recognize more  more  remarkable knowledge  human nature why did  urge me so little about  princess because  knew  her beauty  my ardour would carry me further than all his argumentsand   less i thought about  thing  more likely  i  do it he must have seen  unhappiness  might bring   princess but  went  nothing  him can i say confidently    wrong if  king  restored  princess must turn  him either knowing or not knowing  change and if  king  not restored  us it   subject  we had never yet spoken of but i had  idea that  such  case sapt meant  seat me   throne  ruritania   term  my life he would have set satan himself there sooner than  pupil  his black michael the ball   sumptuous affair i opened   dancing  quadrille  flavia then i waltzed  her curious eyes  eager whispers attended us we went   supper and half way through i half mad  then  her glance had answered mine  her quick breathing met my stammered sentencesi rose  my place before all  brilliant crowd  taking  red rose  i wore flung  ribbon   jewelled badge round her neck in  tumult  applause i sat down i saw sapt smiling over his wine  fritz frowning the rest   meal passed  silence neither flavia nor i could speak fritz touched me   shoulder  i rose gave her my arm  walked down  hall into  little room where coffee  served  us the gentlemen  ladies  attendance withdrew  we  alone the little room had french windows opening   gardens the night  fine cool  fragrant flavia sat down  i stood opposite her i  struggling  myself if she had not looked  me i believe  even then i should have won my fight but suddenly involuntarily she gave me one brief glancea glance  question hurriedly turned aside  blush   question had ever come spread over her cheek  she caught her breath ah if you had seen her i forgot  king  zenda i forgot  king  strelsau she   princessand i  impostor do you think i remembered that i threw myself  my knee  seized her hands  mine i said nothing why should i the soft sounds   night set my wooing   wordless melody  i pressed my kisses  her lips she pushed me  her crying suddenly “ah   true or   only because you must” “it’s true” i said  low smothered tones“true  i love you more than lifeor truthor honour” she set no meaning  my words treating them  one  love’s sweet extravagances she came close  me  whispered “oh if you  not  king then i could show you how i love you how    i love you now rudolf” “now” “yesjust lately ii never did before” pure triumph filled me it  irudolf rassendyllwho had won her i caught her round  waist “you didn’t love me before” i asked she looked up into my face smiling  she whispered “it must have been your crown i felt  first   coronation day” “never before” i asked eagerly she laughed low “you speak  if you would  pleased  hear me say ‘yes’  that” she said “would ‘yes’  true” “yes” i just heard her breathe  she went    instant “be careful rudolf  careful dear he   mad now” “what michael if michael   worst” “what worse  there” there  yet  chance  me controlling myself   mighty effort i took my hands off her  stood  yard or two away i remember now  note   wind   elm trees outside “if i  not  king” i began “if i  only  private gentleman” before i could finish her hand   mine “if you   convict   prison  strelsau you would  my king” she said and under my breath i groaned “god forgive me” and holding her hand  mine i said again “if i  not  king” “hush hush” she whispered “i don’t deserve iti don’t deserve   doubted ah rudolf does  woman who marries without love look   man  i look  you” and she hid her face  me for more than  minute we stood there together  i even  my arm about her summoned up what honour  conscience her beauty   toils  i   had left me “flavia” i said   strange dry voice  seemed not my own “i am not” as i spokeas she raised her eyes  methere   heavy step   gravel outside   man appeared

eminence  cardinal  waited this quarter   hour  offer his respectful adieu  your majesty” i met his eye full  square  i read    angry warning how long  had been  listener i knew not but  had come  upon us   nick  time “we must not keep his eminence waiting” said i but flavia  whose love there lay no shame  radiant eyes  blushing face held out her hand  sapt she said nothing but no man could

good times  bad god save your royal highness” he paused  added glancing  me  drawing himself up  military erectness “but before all comes  kinggod save  king” and flavia caught  my hand  kissed it murmuring “amen good god amen” we went into  ballroom again forced  receive adieus i  separated  flavia everyone when they left me went  her sapt  out     throng  where  had been glances smiles

“well  if i hador  score  men i tell you i could raise all strelsau  you   hour  choke you  your liesyes your mad liesin your mouth” “it’s gospel truth”  said“thanks  my advice you could” “i could

broad terrace  ran along  back   house   window above our heads stood open “madame” cried  countess merrily  flavia herself looked out i bared my head  bowed she wore  white gown  her hair  loosely gathered   knot she kissed her hand  me crying “bring  king up helga i’ll give him some coffee” the countess   gay glance led  way  took me into flavia’s morningroom and left alone we greeted one another  lovers  wont then  princess laid two letters before me one   black michaela most courteous request  she would honour him  spending  day  his castle  zenda  had been her custom once  year   summer when  place   gardens    height  their great beauty i threw  letter down  disgust  flavia laughed  me then growing grave again she pointed   other sheet “i don’t know who  comes from” she said “read it” i knew   moment there  no signature  all this time but  handwriting   same   which had told me   snare   summerhouse   antoinette de mauban’s “i have no cause  love you”  ran “but god forbid  you should fall into  power   duke accept no invitations  his go nowhere without  large guarda regiment  not too much  make you safe show this if you can  him who reigns  strelsau” “why doesn’t  say ‘the king’” asked flavia leaning over my shoulder so   ripple  her hair played  my cheek “is   hoax” “as you value life  more than life my queen” i said “obey    very letter a regiment shall camp round your house today see  you do not go out unless well guarded” “an order sire” she asked  little rebellious “yes  order madameif you love me” “ah” she cried  i could not but kiss her “you know who

michael” she said   proud smile “i’m strong enough  anything while you  safe” said i soon i tore myself away  her  then without consulting sapt i took my way   house  marshal strakencz i had seen something   old general  i liked  trusted him sapt  less enthusiastic but i had learnt  now  sapt  best pleased when  could do everything  jealousy played some part  his views as things  now i had more work than sapt  fritz could manage  they must come  me  zenda  i wanted  man  guard what i loved most  all  world  suffer me  set about my task  releasing  king   quiet mind the marshal received me  most loyal kindness to some extent i took him into my confidence i charged him   care   princess looking him full  significantly   face  i bade him let no one  her cousin  duke approach her unless  himself  there   dozen  his men  him “you may  right sire” said he shaking his grey head sadly “i have known better men than  duke do worse things than   love” i could quite appreciate  remark but i said “there’s something beside love marshal love’s   heart  there nothing my brother might like  his head” “i pray  you wrong him sire” “marshal i’m leaving strelsau   few days every evening i  send  courier  you if  three days none comes you  publish  order which i  give you depriving duke michael   governorship  strelsau  appointing you  his place you  declare  state  siege then you  send word

“the princess flavia” “and swear  me  your faith  honour    fear   living god  you  stand  her   death  kill  reptile  seat her where i sit now” “on my faith  honour    fear  god i swear it and may almighty god preserve your majesty  i think  you go   errand  danger” “i hope  no life more precious than mine may  demanded” said i rising then i held out my hand  him “marshal” i said “in days  come  may bei know notthat you  hear strange things   man who speaks  you now let him  what  may  who  may what say you   manner  which   borne himself  king  strelsau” the old man holding my hand spoke  me man  man “i have known many   elphbergs” said he “and i have seen you and happen what may you have borne yourself   wise king   brave man ay  you have proved  courteous  gentleman   gallant  lover  any  have been   house” “be  my epitaph” said i “when  time comes  another sits   throne  ruritania” “god send  far day  may i not see it” said he i  much moved   marshal’s worn face twitched i sat down  wrote my order “i can hardly yet write” said i “my finger  stiff still” it was  fact  first time  i had ventured  write more than  signature   spite   pains i had taken  learn  king’s hand i  not yet perfect  it “indeed sire”  said “it differs  little  your ordinary handwriting it  unfortunate   may lead   suspicion  forgery” “marshal” said i   laugh “what use   guns  strelsau if they can’t assuage  little suspicion” he smiled grimly  took  paper “colonel sapt  fritz von tarlenheim go  me” i continued “you go  seek  duke”  asked   low tone “yes  duke  someone else  whom i have need  who   zenda” i replied “i wish i could go  you”  cried tugging  his white moustache “i’d like  strike  blow  you  your crown” “i leave you what  more than my life  more than my crown” said i “because you   man i trust more than all other  ruritania” “i  deliver her  you safe  sound” said he “and failing that i  make her queen” we parted  i returned   palace  told sapt  fritz what i had done sapt had  few faults  find   few grumbles  utter this  merely what i expected  sapt liked   consulted beforehand not informed afterwards but   whole  approved  my plans  his spirits rose high   hour  action drew nearer  nearer fritz too  ready though he poor fellow risked more than sapt did     lover  his happiness hung   scale yet how i envied him for  triumphant issue which would crown him  happiness  unite him  his mistress  success  which we  bound  hope  strive  struggle meant  me sorrow more certain  greater than if i  doomed  fail he understood something  this  when we  alone save  old sapt who  smoking   other end   room  passed his arm through mine saying “it’s hard  you don’t think i don’t trust you i know you have nothing but true thoughts  your heart” but i turned away  him thankful   could not see what my heart held but only  witness   deeds  my hands   do yet even  did not understand   had not dared  lift his eyes   princess flavia  i had lifted mine our plans  now all made even  we proceeded  carry them out   they  hereafter appear the next morning we   start   hunting excursion i had made all arrangements  being absent  now there  only one thing left  dothe hardest  most heartbreaking as evening fell i drove through  busy streets  flavia’s residence i  recognized  i went  heartily cheered i played my part  made shift  look  happy lover in spite  my depression i  almost amused   coolness  delicate hauteur  which my sweet lover received me she had heard   king  leaving strelsau   hunting expedition “i regret  we cannot amuse your majesty here  strelsau” she said tapping her foot lightly   floor “i would have offered you more entertainment but i  foolish enough  think” “well what” i asked leaning over her “that just   day or two afterafter last nightyou might  happy without much gaiety”  she turned pettishly  me  she added “i hope  boars   more engrossing” “i’m going after  very big boar” said i and because i could not help it i began  play  her hair but she moved her head away “are you offended  me” i asked  feigned surprise  i could not resist tormenting her  little i had never seen her angry  every fresh aspect  her   delight  me “what right have i   offended true you said last night  every hour away  me  wasted but  very big boar that’s  different thing” “perhaps  boar  hunt me” i suggested “perhaps flavia he’ll catch me” she made no answer “you  not touched even   danger” still she said nothing  i stealing round found her eyes full  tears “you weep  my danger” then she spoke very low “this  like what you used  be but not like  kingthe king ii have come  love” with  sudden great groan i caught her  my heart “my darling” i cried forgetting everything but her “did you dream  i left you  go hunting” “what then rudolf ah you’re not going” “well   hunting i go  seek michael  his lair” she had turned very pale “so you see sweet i  not so poor  lover  you thought me i shall not  long gone” “you  write  me rudolf” i  weak but i could not say  word  stir suspicion  her “i’ll send you all my heart every day” said i “and you’ll run no danger” “none  i need not” “and when  you  back ah how long   be” “when shall i  back” i repeated “yes yes don’t  long dear don’t  long i shan’t sleep while you’re away” “i don’t know when i shall  back” said i “soon rudolf soon” “god knows my darling but if never” “hush hush”  she pressed her lips  mine “if never” i whispered “you must take my place you’ll   only one   house then you must reign  not weep  me” for  moment she drew herself up like  very queen “yes i will” she said “i  reign i  do my part though all my life   empty  my heart dead yet i’ll do it” she paused  sinking against me again wailed softly “come soon come soon” carried away i cried loudly “as god lives iyes i myselfwill see you once more before i die” “what do you mean” she exclaimed  wondering eyes but i had no answer  her  she gazed  me  her wondering eyes i dared not ask her  forget she would have found   insult i could not tell her then who  what i was she  weeping  i had but  dry her tears “shall  man not come back   loveliest lady  all  wide world” said i “a thousand michaels should not keep me  you” she clung  me  little comforted “you won’t let michael hurt you” “no sweetheart” “or keep you  me” “no sweetheart” “nor anyone else” and again i answered “no sweetheart” yet

could not have been more than twentytwo or twentythree took  lead  made us  neatest speech wherein my devoted subject  loving brother michael  strelsau prayed me  pardon him  not paying his addresses  person and further  not putting his castle  my disposal  reason  both  these apparent derelictions being    several  his servants lay sick  scarlet fever     very sad  also  very infectious state so declared young rupert   insolent smile  his curling upper lip   toss  his thick hairhe   handsome villain   gossip ran  many  lady had troubled her heart  him already “if my brother  scarlet fever” said i “he  nearer my complexion than   wont  be my lord i trust  does not suffer” “he  able  attend  his affairs sire” “i hope all beneath your roof  not sick what  my good friends de gautet bersonin  detchard i heard  last had suffered  hurt” lauengram  krafstein looked glum  uneasy but young rupert’s smile grew broader “he hopes soon  find  medicine  it sire”  answered and i burst out laughing  i knew what medicine detchard longed forit  called revenge “you  dine  us gentlemen” i asked young rupert  profuse  apologies they had urgent duties   castle “then” said i   wave  my hand “to our next meeting gentlemen may  make us better acquainted” “we  pray your majesty   early opportunity” quoth rupert airily   strode past sapt  such jeering scorn  his face  i saw  old fellow clench his fist  scowl black  night for my part if  man must needs   knave i would have him  debonair knave  i liked rupert hentzau better than his longfaced closeeyed companions it makes your sin no worse  i conceive  do   la mode  stylishly now    curious thing   this first night instead  eating  excellent dinner my cooks had prepared  me i must needs leave my gentlemen  eat  alone under sapt’s presiding care  ride myself  fritz   town  zenda   certain little inn  i knew of there  little danger   excursion  evenings  long  light   road this side  zenda well frequented so off we rode   groom behind us i muffled myself up   big cloak “fritz” said i  we entered  town “there’s  uncommonly pretty girl  this inn” “how do you know”  asked “because i’ve been there” said i “since”  began “no before” said i “but they’ll recognize you” “well  course they will now don’t argue my good fellow but listen  me we’re two gentlemen   king’s household  one  us   toothache the other  order  private room  dinner and further  bottle   best wine   sufferer and if    clever  fellow  i take him for  pretty girl  no other  wait  us” “what if she won’t” objected fritz “my dear fritz” said i “if she won’t  you she   me” we    inn nothing  me but my eyes  visible  i walked in the landlady received us two minutes later my little friend ever i fear me   lookout  such guests  might prove amusing made her appearance dinner   wine  ordered i sat down   private room a minute later fritz came in “she’s coming”  said “if she  not i should have  doubt  countess helga’s taste” she came in i gave her time  set  wine downi didn’t want  dropped fritz poured out  glass  gave   me “is  gentleman  great pain”  girl asked sympathetically “the gentleman  no worse than when  saw you last” said i throwing away my cloak she started   little shriek then she cried “it   king then i told mother so  moment i saw his picture oh sir forgive me” “faith you gave me nothing  hurt much” said i “but  things we said” “i forgive them   thing you did” “i must go  tell mother” “stop” said i assuming  graver air “we  not here  sport tonight go  bring dinner  not  word   king being here” she came back   few minutes looking grave yet very curious “well how  johann” i asked beginning my dinner “oh  fellow sirmy lord king i mean” “‘sir’  do please how  he” “we hardly see him now sir” “and why not” “i told him  came too often sir” said she tossing her head “so  sulks  stays away” “yes sir” “but you could bring him back” i suggested   smile “perhaps i could” said she “i know your powers you see” said i  she blushed  pleasure “it’s not only that sir  keeps him away he’s very busy   castle” “but there’s no shooting  now” “no sir but he’s  charge   house” “johann turned housemaid” the little girl  brimming over  gossip “well there  no others” said she “there’s not  woman therenot   servant i mean they do saybut perhaps it’s false sir” “let’s have   what it’s worth” said i “indeed i’m ashamed  tell you sir” “oh see i’m looking   ceiling” “they do say there   lady there sir but except  her there’s not  woman   place and johann   wait   gentlemen” “poor johann he must  overworked yet i’m sure  could find half  hour  come  see you” “it would depend   time sir perhaps” “do you love him” i asked “not i sir” “and you wish  serve  king” “yes sir” “then tell him  meet you   second milestone out  zenda tomorrow evening  ten o’clock say you’ll  there   walk home  him” “do you mean him harm sir” “not if   do  i bid him but i think i’ve told you enough my pretty maid see  you do  i bid you and mind no one   know   king  been here” i spoke  little sternly  there  seldom harm  infusing  little fear into  woman’s liking  you  i softened  effect  giving her  handsome present then we dined and wrapping my cloak about my face  fritz leading  way we went downstairs  our horses again it  but halfpast eight  hardly yet dark  streets  full  such  quiet little place  i could see  gossip  all agog with  king  one side   duke   other zenda felt itself  centre  all ruritania we jogged gently through  town but set our horses   sharper pace when we reached  open country “you want  catch this fellow johann” asked fritz “ay  i fancy i’ve baited  hook right our little delilah  bring our samson it  not enough fritz  have no women   house though brother michael shows some wisdom there if you want safety you must have none within fifty miles” “none nearer than strelsau  instance” said poor fritz   lovelorn sigh we reached  avenue   chateau   soon   house as  hoofs  our horses sounded   gravel sapt rushed out  meet us “thank god you’re safe”  cried “have you seen anything  them” “of whom” i asked dismounting he drew us aside   grooms might not hear “lad”  said  me “you must not ride about here unless  half  dozen  us you know among our men  tall young fellow bernenstein  name” i knew him he   fine strapping young man almost  my height   light complexion “he lies  his room upstairs   bullet through his arm” “the deuce  does” “after dinner  strolled out alone  went  mile or so into  wood    walked  thought  saw three men among  trees  one levelled  gun  him he had no weapon   started   run back towards  house but one  them fired    hit  had much ado  reach here before  fainted by good luck they feared  pursue him nearer  house” he paused  added “lad  bullet  meant  you” “it  very likely” said i “and it’s first blood  brother michael” “i wonder which three  was” said fritz “well sapt” i said “i went out tonight  no idle purpose  you shall hear but there’s one thing  my mind” “what’s that”  asked “why this” i answered “that i shall ill requite  very great honours ruritania  done me if i depart   leaving one  those six aliveneither   help  god  i” and sapt shook my hand  that chapter  an improvement  jacob’s ladder in  morning   day after   which i swore my oath against  six i gave certain orders  then rested  greater contentment than i had known  some time i   work  work though  cannot cure love  yet  narcotic  it so  sapt who grew feverish marvelled  see me sprawling   armchair   sunshine listening  one  my friends who sang me amorous songs   mellow voice  induced  me  pleasing melancholy thus  i engaged when young rupert hentzau who feared neither man nor devil  rode through  demesnewhere every tree might hide  marksman  all  knewas though  had been  park  strelsau cantered up  where i lay bowing  burlesque deference  craving private speech  me  order  deliver  message   duke  strelsau i made all withdraw  then  said seating himself  me “the king   love  seems” “not  life my lord” said i smiling “it  well”  rejoined “come we  alone rassendyll” i rose   sitting posture “what’s  matter”  asked “i  about  call one  my gentlemen  bring your horse my lord if you do not know how  address  king my brother must find another messenger” “why keep up  farce”  asked negligently dusting his boot  his glove “because   not finished yet  meanwhile i’ll choose my own name” “oh so  it yet i spoke  love  you  indeed you   man after my own heart” “saving my poor honesty” said i “maybe i am but  i keep faith  men  honour  women maybe i am my lord” he darted  glance  mea glance  anger “is your mother dead” said i “ay she’s dead” “she may thank god” said i  i heard him curse me softly “well what’s  message” i continued i had touched him   raw  all  world knew  had broken his mother’s heart  flaunted his mistresses  her house  his airy manner  gone   moment “the duke offers you more than i would”  growled “a halter  you sire  my suggestion but  offers you safeconduct across  frontier   million crowns” “i prefer your offer my lord if i am bound  one” “you refuse” “of course” “i told michael you would”   villain his temper restored gave me  sunniest  smiles “the fact is between ourselves”  continued “michael doesn’t understand  gentleman” i began  laugh “and you” i asked “i do”  said “well well  halter  it” “i’m sorry you won’t live  see it” i observed “has his majesty done me  honour  fasten  particular quarrel  me” “i would you   few years older though” “oh god gives years but  devil gives increase” laughed he “i can hold my own” “how  your prisoner” i asked “the k” “your prisoner” “i forgot your wishes sire well   alive” he rose  his feet i imitated him then   smile  said “and  pretty princess faith i’ll wager  next elphberg   red enough  all  black michael   called his father” i sprang  step towards him clenching my hand he did not move  inch  his lip curled  insolent amusement “go while your skin’s whole” i muttered he had repaid me  interest my hit about his mother then came  most audacious thing i have known  my life my friends  some thirty yards away rupert called   groom  bring him his horse  dismissed  fellow   crown the horse stood near i stood still suspecting nothing rupert made  though  mount then  suddenly turned  me his left hand resting  his belt his right outstretched “shake hands”  said i bowed  did   had foreseeni put my hands behind me quicker than thought his left hand darted out  me   small dagger flashed   air  struck me   left shoulderhad i not swerved  had been my heart with  cry i staggered back without touching  stirrup  leapt upon his horse   off like  arrow pursued  cries  revolver shotsthe last  useless   firstand i sank into my chair bleeding profusely  i watched  devil’s brat disappear down  long avenue my friends surrounded me  then i fainted i suppose  i  put  bed  there lay unconscious or half conscious  many hours    night when i awoke  my full mind  found fritz beside me i  weak  weary but  bade me   good cheer saying  my wound would soon heal   meanwhile all had gone well  johann  keeper had fallen into  snare we had laid  him   even now   house “and  queer thing is” pursued fritz “that i fancy he’s not altogether sorry  find himself here he seems  think  when black michael  brought off his coup witnesses  how   effectedsaving  course  six themselveswill not    premium” this idea argued  shrewdness  our captive which led me  build hopes  his assistance i ordered him   brought   once sapt conducted him  set him   chair  my bedside he  sullen  afraid but  say truth after young rupert’s exploit we also had our fears and if  got  far  possible  sapt’s formidable sixshooter sapt kept him  far   could  me moreover when  came  his hands  bound but  i would not suffer i need not stay  recount  safeguards  rewards we promised  fellowall  which  honourably observed  paid so   lives now  prosperity though where i may not mention  we   more free inasmuch  we soon learnt    rather  weak man than  wicked  had acted throughout this matter more  fear   duke   his own brother max than  any love  what  done but  had persuaded all  his loyalty  though not  their secret counsels  yet  his knowledge  their dispositions within  castle able  lay bare before us  very heart  their devices and here  brief  his story below  level   ground   castle approached   flight  stone steps which abutted   end   drawbridge  situated two small rooms cut out   rock itself the outer   two had no windows but  always lighted  candles  inner had one square window which gave upon  moat in  outer room there lay always day  night three   six   instructions  duke michael were   any attack being made   outer room  three   defend  door   so long  they could without risk  themselves but so soon   door should   danger  being forced then rupert hentzau or detchard for one  these two  always there should leave  others  hold   long  they could  himself pass into  inner room and without more ado kill  king who lay there welltreated indeed but without weapons   his arms confined  fine steel chains which did not allow him  move his elbow more than three inches  his side thus before  outer door  stormed  king would  dead and his body for his body would  evidence  damning  himself “nay sir” said johann “his highness  thought  that while  two hold  outer room  one who  killed  king unlocks  bars   square window they turn   hinge the window now gives no light   mouth  choked   great pipe  earthenware  this pipe which  large enough  let pass through   body   man passes into  moat coming   end immediately above  surface   water so  there  no perceptible interval between water  pipe the king being dead his murderer swiftly ties  weight   body and dragging    window raises    pulley for lest  weight should prove too great detchard  provided one till   level   mouth   pipe he inserts  feet   pipe  pushes  body down silently without splash or sound  falls into  water  thence   bottom   moat which  twenty feet deep thereabouts this done  murderer cries loudly ‘all’s well’  himself slides down  pipe   others if they can   attack  not too hot run   inner room and seeking  moment’s delay bar  door   their turn slide down and though  king rises not   bottom they rise  swim round   other side where  orders   men  wait them  ropes  haul them out  horses and here if things go ill  duke  join them  seek safety  riding but if all goes well they  return   castle  have their enemies   trap that sir   plan  his highness   disposal   king  case  need but   not   used till  last for  we all know   not minded  kill  king unless  can before or soon after kill you also sir now sir i have spoken  truth  god  my witness  i pray you  shield me   vengeance  duke michael  if after  knows what i have done i fall into his hands i shall pray  one thing out  all  worlda speedy death   i shall not obtain  him” the fellow’s story  rudely told but our questions supplemented his narrative what  had told us applied   armed attack but if suspicions  aroused  there came overwhelming forcesuch  instance  i  king could bringthe idea  resistance would  abandoned  king would  quietly murdered  slid down  pipe andhere comes  ingenious touchone   six would take his place   cell and   entrance   searchers loudly demand release  redress  michael being summoned would confess  hasty action but  would say  man had angered him  seeking  favour   lady   castle this  antoinette de mauban   had confined him there   conceived he  lord  zenda had right  do but   now  receiving his apology content  let him go  so end  gossip which  his highness’s annoyance had arisen concerning  prisoner  zenda  had given his visitors  trouble  this enquiry the visitors baffled would retire  michael could  his leisure dispose   body   king sapt fritz  i  my bed looked round  one another  horror  bewilderment   cruelty  cunning   plan whether i went  peace or  war openly   head   corps or secretly   stealthy assault  king would  dead before i could come near him if michael  stronger  overcame my party there would   end but if i  stronger i should have no way  punish him no means  proving any guilt  him without proving my own guilt also on  other hand i should  left  king ah   moment my pulse quickened   would    future  witness  final struggle between him  me he seemed  have made triumph possible  ruin impossible at  worst  would stand  well   had stood before i crossed his pathwith but one man between him   throne   man  impostor  best there would  none left  stand against him i had begun  think  black michael  over fond  leaving  fighting  his friends but now i acknowledged   brains if not  arms   conspiracy  his “does  king know this” i asked “i  my brother” answered johann “put up  pipe under  orders  my lord  hentzau he   guard  day   king asked my lord what  meant ‘faith’  answered  his airy laugh ‘it’s  new improvement   ladder  jacob whereby  you have read sire men pass   earth  heaven we thought  not meet  your majesty should go  case sire you must go   common route so we have made you  pretty private passage where  vulgar cannot stare  you or incommode your passage that sire   meaning   pipe’ and  laughed  bowed  prayed  king’s leave  replenish  king’s glassfor  king   supper and  king though    brave man   all  his house grew red  then white   looked   pipe    merry devil who mocked him ah sir” and  fellow shuddered “it  not easy  sleep quiet   castle  zenda  all  them would  soon cut  man’s throat  play  game  cards  my lord rupert would choose  sooner   pastime than any otheray sooner than  would ruin  woman though   loves also” the man ceased  i bade fritz take him away  have him carefully guarded and turning  him i added “if anyone asks you if there   prisoner  zenda you may answer ‘yes’ but if any asks who  prisoner is do not answer for all my promises  not save you if any man here learns  you  truth    prisoner  zenda i’ll kill you like  dog if  thing  so much  breathed within  house” then when   gone i looked  sapt “it’s  hard nut” said i “so hard” said he shaking his grizzled head “that  i think this time next year  like  find you still king  ruritania”   broke out into curses  michael’s cunning i lay back  my pillows “there seems  me” i observed “to  two ways  which  king can come out  zenda alive one   treachery   duke’s followers” “you can leave  out” said sapt “i hope not” i rejoined “because  other i  about  mention isby  miracle  heaven” chapter  a night outside  castle it would have surprised  good people  ruritania  know   foregoing talk for according   official reports i had suffered  grievous  dangerous hurt   accidental spearthrust received   course  my sport i caused  bulletins     very serious character  created great public excitement whereby three things occurred first i gravely offended  medical faculty  strelsau  refusing  summon  my bedside any  them save  young man  friend  fritz’s whom we could trust secondly i received word  marshal strakencz  my orders seemed  have no more weight than his    princess flavia  leaving  tarlenheim under his unwilling escort news whereat i strove not   glad  proud  thirdly my brother  duke  strelsau although too well informed  believe  account   origin  my sickness  yet persuaded   reports   my seeming inactivity  i   truth incapable  action   my life   some danger this i learnt   man johann whom i  compelled  trust  send back  zenda where   way rupert hentzau had him soundly flogged  daring  smirch  morals  zenda  staying out all night   pursuits  love this  rupert johann deeply resented   duke’s approval   did more  bind  keeper  my side than all my promises on flavia’s arrival i cannot dwell her joy  finding me up  well instead   my back  fighting  death makes  picture  even now dances before my eyes till they grow too dim  see it  her reproaches  i had not trusted even her must excuse  means i took  quiet them in truth  have her  me once more  like  taste  heaven   damned soul  sweeter   inevitable doom    follow  i rejoiced  being able  waste two whole days  her and when i had wasted two days  duke  strelsau arranged  huntingparty the stroke  near now for sapt  i after anxious consultations had resolved  we must risk  blow our resolution being clinched  johann’s news   king grew peaked pale  ill   his health  breaking down under his rigorous confinement now  manbe  king or no kingmay  well die swiftly   becomes  gentleman  bullet or thrust  rot his life out   cellar that thought made prompt action advisable   interests   king  my own point  view  grew more  more necessary for strakencz urged  me  need   speedy marriage  my own inclinations seconded him  such terrible insistence  i feared  my resolution i do not believe  i should have done  deed i dreamt of but i might have come  flight  my flight would have ruined  cause andyes i am no saint ask my little sisterinlaw  worse still might have happened it  perhaps  strange  thing   ever been   history   country   king’s brother   king’s personator   time  profound outward peace near  placid undisturbed country town under semblance  amity should wage  desperate war   person  life   king yet such   struggle  began now between zenda  tarlenheim when i look back   time i seem  myself  have been half mad sapt  told me  i suffered no interference  listened  no remonstrances  if ever  king  ruritania ruled like  despot i was  those days  man look where i would i saw nothing  made life sweet  me  i took my life  my hand  carried  carelessly   man dangles  old glove at first they strove  guard me  keep me safe  persuade me not  expose myself but when they saw how i  set there grew up among themwhether they knew  truth or nota feeling  fate ruled  issue   i must  left  play my game  michael my own way late next night i rose  table where flavia had sat  me  conducted her   door  her apartments there i kissed her hand  bade her sleep sound  wake  happy days then i changed my clothes  went out sapt  fritz  waiting  me  six men   horses over his saddle sapt carried  long coil  rope  both  heavily armed i had  me  short stout cudgel   long knife making  circuit we avoided  town    hour found ourselves slowly mounting  hill  led   castle  zenda the night  dark  very stormy gusts  wind  spits  rain caught us  we breasted  incline   great trees moaned  sighed when we came   thick clump about  quarter   mile   castle we bade our six friends hide there   horses sapt had  whistle  they could rejoin us   few moments if danger came but up  now we had met no one i hoped  michael  still off his guard believing me   safe  bed however  might be we gained  top   hill without accident  found ourselves   edge   moat where  sweeps under  road separating  old castle  it a tree stood   edge   bank  sapt silently  diligently set  make fast  rope i stripped off my boots took  pull   flask  brandy loosened  knife   sheath  took  cudgel between my teeth then i shook hands  my friends not heeding  last look  entreaty  fritz  laid hold   rope i  going  have  look  “jacob’s ladder” gently i lowered myself into  water though  night  wild  day had been warm  bright   water  not cold i struck out  began  swim round  great walls which frowned above me i could see only three yards ahead i had then good hopes  not being seen  i crept along close under  damp mossgrown masonry there  lights   new part   castle   other side  now  again i heard laughter  merry shouts i fancied i recognized young rupert hentzau’s ringing tones  pictured him flushed  wine recalling my thoughts   business  hand i rested  moment if johann’s description  right i must  near  window now very slowly i moved  out   darkness ahead loomed  shape it   pipe curving   window   water about four feet   surface  displayed    big round  two men i  about  approach it when i saw something else  my heart stood still the nose   boat protruded beyond  pipe   other side  listening intently i heard  slight shuffleas   man shifting his position who   man who guarded michael’s invention was  awake or   asleep i felt if my knife  ready  trod water  i did so i found bottom under my feet the foundations   castle extended some fifteen inches making  ledge  i stood  it out  water  my armpits upwards then i crouched  peered through  darkness under  pipe where curving  left  space there   man   boat a rifle lay  himi saw  gleam   barrel here   sentinel he sat very still i listened  breathed heavily regularly monotonously by heaven  slept kneeling   shelf i drew forward under  pipe till my face  within two feet  his he   big man i saw it  max holf  brother  johann my hand stole  my belt  i drew out my knife of all  deeds  my life i love  least  think  this  whether    act   man or  traitor i  not ask i said  myself “it  warand  king’s life   stake” and i raised myself  beneath  pipe  stood up   boat which lay moored   ledge holding my breath i marked  spot  raised my arm the great fellow stirred he opened his eyeswide wider he gasped  terror  my face  clutched  his rifle i struck home and i heard  chorus   lovesong   opposite bank leaving him where  lay  huddled mass i turned  “jacob’s ladder” my time  short this fellow’s turn  watching might  over directly  relief would come leaning over  pipe i examined it   end near  water   topmost extremity where  passed or seemed  pass through  masonry   wall there  no break  it no chink dropping  my knees i tested  under side and my breath went quick  fast   this lower side where  pipe should have clung close   masonry there   gleam  light that light must come   cell   king i set my shoulder against  pipe  exerted my strength the chink widened  very very little  hastily i desisted i had done enough  show   pipe  not fixed   masonry   lower side then i heard  voicea harsh grating voice “well sire if you have had enough  my society i  leave you  repose but i must fasten  little ornaments first” it  detchard i caught  english accent   moment “have you anything  ask sire before we part” the king’s voice followed it  his though   faint  hollowdifferent   merry tones i had heard   glades   forest “pray my brother” said  king “to kill me i am dying  inches here” “the duke does not desire your death sireyet” sneered detchard “when  does behold your path  heaven” the king answered “so  it and now if your orders allow it pray leave me” “may you dream  paradise” said  ruffian the light disappeared i heard  bolts   door run home and then i heard  sobs   king he  alone   thought who dares mock  him i did not venture  speak  him the risk  some exclamation escaping him  surprise  too great i dared do nothing  night  my task now   get myself away  safety   carry off  carcass   dead man to leave him there would tell too much casting loose  boat i got in the wind  blowing  gale now  there  little danger  oars being heard i rowed swiftly round  where my friends waited i had just reached  spot when  loud whistle sounded over  moat behind me “hullo max” i heard shouted i hailed sapt   low tone the rope came down i tied  round  corpse  then went up  myself “whistle you too” i whispered “for our men  haul   line no talk now” they hauled up  body just   reached  road three men  horseback swept round   front   castle we saw them but being  foot ourselves we escaped their notice but we heard our men coming up   shout “the devil but it’s dark” cried  ringing voice it  young rupert a moment later shots rang out our people had met them i started forward   run sapt  fritz following me “thrust thrust” cried rupert again   loud groan following told   himself  not behindhand “i’m done rupert” cried  voice “they’re three  one save yourself” i ran on holding my cudgel  my hand suddenly  horse came towards me a man   it leaning over his shoulder “are you cooked too krafstein”  cried there  no answer i sprang   horse’s head it  rupert hentzau “at last” i cried for we seemed  have him he had only his sword  his hand my men  hot upon him sapt  fritz  running up i had outstripped them but if they got close enough  fire  must die or surrender “at last” i cried “it’s  playactor” cried he slashing  my cudgel he cut  clean  two and judging discretion better than death i ducked my head  i blush  tell it scampered  my life the devil   rupert hentzau   put spurs  his horse  i turning  look saw him ride full gallop   edge   moat  leap in while  shots  our party fell thick round him like hail with one gleam  moonlight we should have riddled him  balls but   darkness  won   corner   castle  vanished  our sight “the deuce take him” grinned sapt “it’s  pity” said i “that he’s  villain whom have we got” we had lauengram  krafstein they lay dead and concealment being no longer possible we flung them  max into  moat and drawing together   compact body rode off down  hill and  our midst went  bodies  three gallant gentlemen thus we travelled home heavy  heart   death  our friends sore uneasy concerning  king  cut   quick  young rupert had played yet another winning hand  us for my own part i  vexed  angry  i had killed no man  open fight but only stabbed  knave  his sleep and i did not love  hear rupert call me  playactor chapter  i talk   tempter ruritania  not england or  quarrel between duke michael  myself could not have gone on   extraordinary incidents which marked it without more public notice being directed  it duels  frequent among all  upper classes  private quarrels between great men kept  old habit  spreading  their friends  dependents nevertheless after  affray which i have just related such reports began  circulate  i felt  necessary    my guard the death   gentlemen involved could not  hidden  their relatives i issued  stern order declaring  duelling had attained unprecedented licence the chancellor drew up  document  me  very well  did it  forbidding  save   gravest cases i sent  public  stately apology  michael   returned  deferential  courteous reply  me  our one point  union wasand  underlay all our differences  induced  unwilling harmony between our actionsthat we could neither  us afford  throw our cards   table he  well  i   “playactor” and hating one another we combined  dupe public opinion unfortunately however  necessity  concealment involved  necessity  delay  king might die  his prison or even  spirited off somewhere else  could not  helped for  little while i  compelled  observe  truce  my only consolation   flavia most warmly approved  my edict against duelling and when i expressed delight  having won her favour prayed me if her favour  any motive  me  prohibit  practice altogether “wait till we  married” said i smiling not  least peculiar result   truce    secrecy which dictated     town  zenda became   daytimei would not have trusted far   protection  nighta sort  neutral zone where both parties could safely go  i riding down one day  flavia  sapt had  encounter   acquaintance which presented  ludicrous side but    same time embarrassing as i rode along i met  dignified looking person driving   twohorsed carriage he stopped his horses got out  approached me bowing low i recognized  head   strelsau police “your majesty’s ordinance   duelling  receiving our best attention”  assured me if  best attention involved his presence  zenda i determined  once  dispense  it “is  what brings you  zenda prefect” i asked “why no sire i am here because i desired  oblige  british ambassador” “what’s  british ambassador doing dans cette galere” said i carelessly “a young countryman  his sirea man  some positionis missing his friends have not heard  him  two months  there  reason  believe    last seen  zenda” flavia  paying little attention i dared not look  sapt “what reason” “a friend  his  parisa certain m featherlyhas given us information which makes  possible   came here   officials   railway recollect his name  some luggage” “what  his name” “rassendyll sire”  answered  i saw   name meant nothing  him but glancing  flavia  lowered his voice   went on “it  thought   may have followed  lady here has your majesty heard   certain madame de mauban” “why yes” said i my eye involuntarily travelling towards  castle “she arrived  ruritania about  same time  this rassendyll” i caught  prefect’s glance   regarding me  enquiry writ large  his face “sapt” said i “i must speak  word   prefect will you ride   few paces   princess” and i added   prefect “come sir what do you mean” he drew close  me  i bent   saddle “if    love   lady”  whispered “nothing  been heard  him  two months”  this time    eye   prefect which travelled towards  castle “yes  lady  there” i said quietly “but i don’t suppose mr rassendyllis   nameis” “the duke”  whispered “does not like rivals sire” “you’re right there” said i  all sincerity “but surely you hint   very grave charge” he spread his hands out  apology i whispered  his ear “this   grave matter go back  strelsau” “but sire if i have  clue here” “go back  strelsau” i repeated “tell  ambassador  you have  clue but  you must  left alone   week or two meanwhile i’ll charge myself  looking into  matter” “the ambassador  very pressing sir” “you must quiet him come sir you see  if your suspicions  correct    affair  which we must move  caution we can have no scandal mind you return tonight” he promised  obey me  i rode   rejoin my companions  little easier  my mind enquiries after me must  stopped  all hazards   week or two  this clever official had come surprisingly near  truth his impression might  useful some day but if  acted   now  might mean  worse   king heartily did i curse george featherly  not holding his tongue “well” asked flavia “have you finished your business” “most satisfactorily” said i “come shall we turn round we  almost trenching  my brother’s territory” we were  fact   extreme end   town just where  hills begin  mount towards  castle we cast our eyes up admiring  massive beauty   old walls  we saw  cortege winding slowly down  hill on  came “let us go back” said sapt “i should like  stay” said flavia  i reined my horse beside hers we could distinguish  approaching party now there came first two mounted servants  black uniforms relieved only   silver badge these  followed   car drawn  four horses  it under  heavy pall lay  coffin behind  rode  man  plain black clothes carrying his hat  his hand sapt uncovered  we stood waiting flavia keeping  me  laying her hand  my arm “it  one   gentlemen killed   quarrel i expect” she said i beckoned   groom “ride  ask whom they escort” i ordered he rode up   servants  i saw him pass    gentleman who rode behind “it’s rupert  hentzau” whispered sapt rupert  was  directly afterwards waving   procession  stand still rupert trotted up  me he    frockcoat tightly buttoned  trousers he wore  aspect  sadness   bowed  profound respect yet suddenly  smiled  i smiled too  old sapt’s hand lay  his left breastpocket  rupert  i both guessed what lay   hand inside  pocket “your majesty asks whom we escort” said rupert “it  my dear friend albert  lauengram” “sir” said i “no one regrets  unfortunate affair more than i my ordinance which i mean  have obeyed  witness  it” “poor fellow” said flavia softly  i saw rupert’s eyes flash  her whereat i grew red for if i had my way rupert hentzau should not have defiled her  so much   glance yet  did   dared  let admiration  seen  his look “your majesty’s words  gracious”  said “i grieve  my friend yet sire others must soon lie   lies now” “it   thing we all do well  remember my lord” i rejoined “even kings sire” said rupert   moralizing tone  old sapt swore softly  my side “it  true” said i “how fares my brother my lord” “he  better sire” “i am rejoiced” “he hopes soon  leave  strelsau when his health  secured” “he  only convalescent then” “there remain one or two small troubles” answered  insolent fellow   mildest tone   world “express my earnest hope” said flavia “that they may soon cease  trouble him” “your royal highness’s wish is humbly my own” said rupert   bold glance  brought  blush  flavia’s cheek i bowed  rupert bowing lower backed his horse  signed  his party  proceed with  sudden impulse i rode after him he turned swiftly fearing that even   presence   dead  before  lady’s eyes i meant him mischief “you fought   brave man  other night” i said “come you  young sir if you  deliver your prisoner alive  me you shall come  no hurt” he looked  me   mocking smile but suddenly  rode nearer  me “i’m unarmed”  said “and our old sapt there could pick me off   minute” “i’m not afraid” said i “no curse you”  answered “look here i made you  proposal   duke once” “i’ll hear nothing  black michael” said i “then hear one  me” he lowered his voice   whisper “attack  castle boldly let sapt  tarlenheim lead” “go on” said i “arrange  time  me” “i have such confidence  you my lord” “tut i’m talking business now sapt there  fritz  fall black michael  fall” “what” “black michael  fall like  dog  is  prisoner  you call him  go  ‘jacob’s ladder’ah you know thatto hell two men   lefti rupert hentzau  you  king  ruritania” he paused  then   voice  quivered  eagerness added “isn’t   hand  playa throne  your princess and  me say  competence  your majesty’s gratitude” “surely” i exclaimed “while you’re above ground hell wants  master” “well think  over”  said “and look you  would take more than  scruple or two  keep me  yonder girl”  his evil eye flashed again  her i loved “get out  my reach” said i  yet   moment i began  laugh   very audacity  it “would you turn against your master” i asked he swore  michael  being what  offspring   legal though morganatic union should not  called  said  me   almost confidential  apparently friendly tone “he gets  my way you know he’s  jealous brute faith i nearly stuck  knife into him last night  came most cursedly mal  propos” my temper  well under control now i  learning something “a lady” i asked negligently “ay   beauty”  nodded “but you’ve seen her” “ah     teaparty when some  your friends got   wrong side   table” “what can you expect  fools like detchard  de gautet i wish i’d been there” “and  duke interferes” “well” said rupert meditatively “that’s hardly  fair way  putting it perhaps i want  interfere” “and she prefers  duke” “ay  silly creature ah well you think about my plan” and   bow  pricked his horse  trotted after  body  his friend i went back  flavia  sapt pondering   strangeness   man wicked men i have known  plenty but rupert hentzau remains unique  my experience and if there  another anywhere let him  caught  hanged out  hand so say i “he’s very handsome isn’t he” said flavia well  course she didn’t know him  i did yet i  put out  i thought his bold glances would have made her angry but my dear flavia   woman  soshe  not put out on  contrary she thought young rupert very handsomeas beyond question  ruffian was “and how sad  looked  his friend’s death” said she “he’ll have better reason   sad  his own” observed sapt   grim smile as  me i grew sulky unreasonable   perhaps  what better business had i  look  her  love than had even rupert’s lustful eyes and sulky i remained till  evening fell  we rode up  tarlenheim sapt having fallen behind  case anyone should  following us flavia riding close beside me said softly   little halfashamed laugh “unless you smile rudolf i cry why  you angry” “it  something  fellow said  me” said i but i  smiling  we reached  door  dismounted there  servant handed me  note   unaddressed “is   me” i asked “yes sire  boy brought it” i tore  open johann carries this  me i warned you once in  name  god  if you   man rescue me  this den  murderersa de m i handed   sapt but all   tough old soul said  reply  this piteous appeal was “whose fault brought her there” nevertheless not being faultless myself i took leave  pity antoinette de mauban chapter  a desperate plan as i had ridden publicly  zenda  had talked there  rupert hentzau  course all pretence  illness    end i marked  effect   garrison  zenda they ceased   seen abroad  any  my men who went near  castle reported   utmost vigilance prevailed there touched  i   madame de mauban’s appeal i seemed  powerless  befriend her  i had proved  help  king michael bade me defiance  although  too had been seen outside  walls  more disregard  appearances than  had hitherto shown  did not take  trouble  send any excuse  his failure  wait   king time ran   inactivity when every moment  pressing  not only  i faced   new danger which  stir about my disappearance brought  me but great murmurs had arisen  strelsau  my continued absence   city they had been greater but   knowledge  flavia   me   this reason i suffered her  stay though i hated  have her where danger was  though every day  our present sweet intercourse strained my endurance almost  breaking as  final blow nothing would content my advisers strakencz   chancellor who came out  strelsau  make  urgent representation  me save  i should appoint  day   public solemnization  my betrothal  ceremony which  ruritania  well nigh  binding  great  thing   marriage itself and thiswith flavia sitting  mei  forced  do setting  date  fortnight ahead  appointing  cathedral  strelsau   place and this formal act being published far  wide caused great joy throughout  kingdom    talk  all tongues so  i reckoned there  but two men who chafed  iti mean black michael  myself  but one who did not know  itthat one  man whose name i bore  king  ruritania in truth i heard something   way  news  received   castle  after  interval  three days  man johann greedy  more money though fearful  his life again found means  visit us he had been waiting   duke when  tidings came black michael’s face had grown blacker still   had sworn savagely nor   better pleased when young rupert took oath  i meant  do  i said  turning  madame de mauban wished her joy   rival gone michael’s hand stole towards his sword said johann but not  bit did rupert care   rallied  duke  having made  better king than had reigned  years past  ruritania “and” said he   meaning bow  his exasperated master “the devil sends  princess  finer man than heaven had marked out  her  my soul  does” then michael harshly bade him hold his tongue  leave them but rupert must needs first kiss madame’s hand which  did  though  loved her while michael glared  him this   lighter side   fellow’s news but more serious came behind    plain  if time pressed  tarlenheim  pressed none  less fiercely  zenda for  king  very sick johann had seen him    wasted  hardly able  move “there could  no thought  taking another  him now” so alarmed  they  they had sent   physician  strelsau   physician having been introduced into  king’s cell had come forth pale  trembling  urgently prayed  duke  let him go back  meddle no more   affair but  duke would not  held him there  prisoner telling him his life  safe if  king lived while  duke desired  died when  duke desirednot otherwise and persuaded   physician they had allowed madame de mauban  visit  king  give him such attendance  his state needed   only  woman can give yet his life hung   balance  i  still strong  whole  free wherefore great gloom reigned  zenda  save when they quarrelled  which they  very prone they hardly spoke but  deeper  depression   rest young rupert went about satan’s work   smile  his eye   song  his lip  laughed “fit  burst” said johann because  duke always set detchard  guard  king when madame de mauban    cellwhich precaution was indeed not unwise  my careful brother thus johann told his tale  seized his crowns yet  besought us  allow him  stay  us  tarlenheim  not venture his head again   lion’s den but we had need  him there and although i refused  constrain him i prevailed  him  increased rewards  go back  carry tidings  madame de mauban  i  working  her  that if she could she should speak one word  comfort   king for while suspense  bad   sick yet despair  worse still   might    king lay dying  mere hopelessness  i could learn  no definite disease  afflicted him “and how do they guard  king now” i asked remembering  two   six  dead  max holf also “detchard  bersonin watch  night rupert hentzau  de gautet  day sir”  answered “only two   time” “ay sir but  others rest   room just above   within sound   cry or  whistle” “a room just above i didn’t know  that is there any communication between    room where they watch” “no sir you must go down  few stairs  through  door   drawbridge  so  where  king  lodged” “and  door  locked” “only  four lords have keys sir” i drew nearer  him “and have they keys   grating” i asked   low whisper “i think sir only detchard  rupert” “where does  duke lodge” “in  chateau   first floor his apartments    right  you go towards  drawbridge” “and madame de mauban” “just opposite   left but her door  locked after she  entered” “to keep her in” “doubtless sir” “perhaps  another reason” “it  possible” “and  duke i suppose   key” “yes and  drawbridge  drawn back  night   that too  duke holds  key so   cannot  run across  moat without application  him” “and where do you sleep” “in  entrance hall   chateau  five servants” “armed” “they have pikes sir but no firearms the duke  not trust them  firearms” then  last i took  matter boldly  my hands i had failed once  “jacob’s ladder” i should fail again there i must make  attack   other side “i have promised you twenty thousand crowns” said i “you shall have fifty thousand if you  do what i ask  you tomorrow night but first do those servants know who your prisoner is” “no sir they believe him   some private enemy   duke’s” “and they would not doubt  i am  king” “how should they”  asked “look  this then tomorrow  two   morning exactly fling open  front door   chateau don’t fail   instant” “shall you  there sir” “ask no questions do what i tell you say  hall  close or what you will that  all i ask  you” “and may i escape   door sir when i have opened it” “yes  quick  your legs  carry you one thing more carry this note  madameoh it’s  french you can’t read itand charge her   sake  all our lives not  fail  what  orders” the man  trembling but i had  trust  what  had  courage   what  had  honesty i dared not wait  i feared   king would die when  fellow  gone i called sapt  fritz  me  unfolded  plan  i had formed sapt shook his head over it “why can’t you wait”  asked “the king may die” “michael   forced  act before that” “then” said i “the king may live” “well  if  does” “for  fortnight” i asked simply and sapt bit his moustache suddenly fritz von tarlenheim laid his hand  my shoulder “let us go  make  attempt” said he “i mean you  godon’t  afraid” said i “ay but do you stay here  take care   princess” a gleam came into old sapt’s eye “we should have michael one way or  other then”  chuckled “whereas if you go   killed   king what  become  those  us who  left” “they  serve queen flavia” said i “and i would  god i could  one  them” a pause followed old sapt broke   saying sadly yet   unmeant drollery  set fritz  me laughing “why didn’t old rudolf  third marry yourgreatgrandmother  it” “come” said i “it   king we  thinking about” “it  true” said fritz “moreover” i went on “i have been  impostor   profit  another but i  not  one  my own  if  king  not alive   his throne before  day  betrothal comes i  tell  truth come what may” “you shall go lad” said sapt here   plan i had made a strong party under sapt’s command   steal up   door   chateau if discovered prematurely they   kill anyone who found themwith their swords  i wanted no noise  firing if all went well they would    door when johann opened it they   rush   secure  servants if their mere presence   use   king’s name  not enough at  same momentand  this hinged  plana woman’s cry   ring out loud  shrill  antoinette de mauban’s chamber again  again she   cry “help help michael help”  then  utter  name  young rupert hentzau then  we hoped michael  fury would rush out  his apartments opposite  fall alive into  hands  sapt still  cries would go on  my men would let down  drawbridge   would  strange if rupert hearing his name thus taken  vain did not descend  where  slept  seek  cross de gautet might or might not come  him  must  left  chance and when rupert set his foot   drawbridge there  my part  i  minded  another swim   moat and lest i should grow weary i had resolved  take  me  small wooden ladder  which i could rest my arms   waterand my feet when i left it i would rear  against  wall just   bridge  when  bridge  across i would stealthily creep   itand then if rupert or de gautet crossed  safety  would  my misfortune not my fault they dead two men only would remain   them we must trust   confusion we had created    sudden rush we should have  keys   door  led   allimportant rooms perhaps they would rush out if they stood  their orders then  king’s life hung   swiftness  which we could force  outer door  i thanked god  not rupert hentzau watched but detchard for though detchard   cool man relentless  no coward  had neither  dash nor  recklessness  rupert moreover he if any one  them really loved black michael   might    would leave bersonin  guard  king  rush across  bridge  take part   affray   other side so i planneddesperately and  our enemy might   better lulled  security i gave orders  our residence should  brilliantly lighted  top  bottom  though we  engaged  revelry  should so  kept all night  music playing  people moving   fro strakencz would  there     conceal our departure if  could  flavia and if we came not again   morning    march openly

probable death   king  rally all  there  honest  true round  banner   princess and  say truth this  what i thought most likely  happen for i had great doubts whether either  king or black michael or i had more than  day  live well if black michael died  if i  playactor slew rupert hentzau  my own hand  then died myself  might   fate would deal  lightly  ruritania  could  hoped notwithstanding  she demanded  life   kingand  her dealing thus  me i   no temper  make objection it  late when we rose  conference  i betook me   princess’s apartments she  pensive  evening yet when i left her she flung her arms about me  grew   instant bashfully radiant  she slipped  ring  my finger i  wearing  king’s ring but i had also  my little finger  plain band  gold engraved   motto  our family “nil quae

trusted  black michael putting this query  himself would answer confidently “none” while even if johann meant treachery  did not know my scheme  would doubtless expect  see me   head  my friends

me   sight  all my friends   terrace  tarlenheim suddenly  duke’s window grew bright the shutters  not closed   interior became partially visible  me  i cautiously raised myself till i stood  tiptoe thus placed my range  sight embraced  yard or more inside  window while  radius  light did not reach me the window  flung open  someone looked out i marked antoinette de mauban’s graceful figure and though her face   shadow  fine outline  her head  revealed against  light behind i longed  cry softly “remember” but i dared notand happily   moment later  man came up  stood  her he tried  put his arm round her waist but   swift motion she sprang away  leant against  shutter her profile towards me i made out who  newcomer was   young rupert a low laugh  him made me sure   leant forward stretching out his hand towards her “gently gently” i murmured “you’re too soon my boy” his head  close  hers i suppose  whispered  her  i saw her point   moat  i heard her say  slow  distinct tones “i had rather throw myself out  this window” he came close up   window  looked out “it looks cold” said he “come antoinette  you serious” she made no answer so far  i heard  he smiting his hand petulantly   windowsill went on   voice  some spoilt child “hang black michael isn’t  princess enough  him is   have everything what  devil do you see  black michael” “if i told him what you say” she began “well tell him” said rupert carelessly and catching her off her guard  sprang forward  kissed her laughing  crying “there’s something  tell him” if i had kept my revolver  me i should have been very sorely tempted being spared  temptation i merely added this new score  his account “though faith” said rupert “it’s little  cares he’s mad about  princess you know he talks  nothing but cutting  playactor’s throat” didn’t he indeed “and if i do   him what do you think he’s promised me” the unhappy woman raised her hands above her head  prayer or  despair “but i detest waiting” said rupert  i saw    about  lay his hand  her again when there   noise   door   room opening   harsh voice cried “what  you doing here sir” rupert turned his back   window bowed low  said  his loud merry tones “apologizing  your absence sir could i leave  lady alone” the newcomer must  black michael i saw him directly   advanced towards  window he caught young rupert   arm “the moat would hold more than  king” said he   significant gesture “does your highness threaten me” asked rupert “a threat  more warning than most men get  me” “yet” observed rupert “rudolf rassendyll  been much threatened  yet lives” “am i  fault because my servants bungle” asked michael scornfully “your highness  run no risk  bungling” sneered rupert it  telling  duke   shirked danger  plain  ever i have heard  man told black michael had selfcontrol i dare say  scowledit   great regret  me  i could not see their faces betterbut his voice  even  calm   answered “enough enough we mustn’t quarrel rupert are detchard  bersonin  their posts” “they are sir” “i need you no more” “nay i’m not oppressed  fatigue” said rupert “pray sir leave us” said michael more impatiently “in ten minutes  drawbridge   drawn back  i presume you have no wish  swim  your bed” rupert’s figure disappeared i heard  door open  shut again michael  antoinette de mauban  left together to my chagrin  duke laid his hand   window  closed it he stood talking  antoinette   moment or two she shook her head   turned impatiently away she left  window the door sounded again  black michael closed  shutters “de gautet de gautet man” sounded   drawbridge “unless you want  bath before your bed come along” it  rupert’s voice coming   end   drawbridge a moment later   de gautet stepped out   bridge rupert’s arm  through de gautet’s    middle   bridge  detained his companion  leant over i dropped behind  shelter  “jacob’s ladder” then master rupert had  little sport he took  de gautet  bottle which  carried  put   his lips “hardly  drop”  cried discontentedly  flung    moat it fell  i judged   sound   circles   water within  yard   pipe and rupert taking out his revolver began  shoot  it the first two shots missed  bottle but hit  pipe the third shattered  bottle i hoped   young ruffian would  content but  emptied  other barrels   pipe  one skimming over  pipe whistled through my hair  i crouched   other side “‘ware bridge”  voice cried  my relief rupert  de gautet cried “a moment”  ran across the bridge  drawn back  all became still the clock struck  quarterpast one i rose  stretched myself  yawned i think some ten minutes had passed when i heard  slight noise  my right i peered over  pipe  saw  dark figure standing   gateway  led   bridge it   man by  careless graceful poise i guessed    rupert again he held  sword  his hand   stood motionless   minute or two wild thoughts ran through me on what mischief   young fiend bent now then  laughed low  himself then  turned his face   wall took  step  my direction and  my surprise began  climb down  wall in  instant i saw  there must  steps   wall   plain they  cut into or affixed   wall  intervals  about eighteen inches rupert set his foot   lower one then  placed his sword between his teeth turned round  noiselessly let himself into  water had  been  matter  my life only i would have swum  meet him dearly would i have loved  fight  out  him then  therewith steel   fine night  none  come between us but there   king i restrained myself but i could not bridle my swift breathing  i watched him   intensest eagerness he swam leisurely  quietly across there  more steps up   other side   climbed them when  set foot   gateway standing   drawnback bridge  felt  his pocket  took something out i heard him unlock  door i could hear no noise   closing behind him he vanished  my sight abandoning my ladderi saw i did not need  nowi swam   side   bridge  climbed half way up  steps there i hung  my sword  my hand listening eagerly the duke’s room  shuttered  dark there   light   window   opposite side   bridge not  sound broke  silence till halfpast one chimed   great clock   tower   chateau there  other plots than mine afoot   castle  night chapter  the forcing   trap the position wherein i stood does not appear very favourable  thought yet   next moment or two i thought profoundly i had i told myself scored one point be rupert hentzau’s errand what  might   villainy   engaged  what  would i had scored one point he    other side   moat   king   would   no fault  mine if ever  set foot   same side again i had three left  deal with two  guard  de gautet  his bed ah if i had  keys i would have risked everything  attacked detchard  bersonin before their friends could join them but i  powerless i must wait till  coming  my friends enticed someone  cross  bridgesomeone   keys and i waited   seemed  half  hour really  about five minutes before  next act   rapid drama began all  still   other side the duke’s room remained inscrutable behind  shutters the light burnt steadily  madame de mauban’s window then i heard  faintest faintest sound  came  behind  door which led   drawbridge   other side   moat it but just reached my ear yet i could not  mistaken   what  was it  made   key being turned very carefully  slowly who  turning it and  what room    key there leapt before my eyes  picture  young rupert   key  one hand his sword   other   evil smile  his face but i did not know what door  was nor  which  his favourite pursuits young rupert  spending  hours   night i  soon   enlightened   next momentbefore my friends could  near  chateau doorbefore johann  keeper would have thought  nerve himself  his taskthere   sudden crash   room   lighted window it sounded  though someone had flung down  lamp   window went dark  black at  same instant  cry rang out shrill   night “help help michael help”   followed   shriek  utter terror i  tingling  every nerve i stood   topmost step clinging   threshold   gate  my right hand  holding my sword  my left suddenly i perceived   gateway  broader than  bridge there   dark corner   opposite side where  man could stand i darted across  stood there thus placed i commanded  path  no man could pass between  chateau   old castle till  had tried conclusions  me there  another shriek then  door  flung open  clanged against  wall  i heard  handle   door savagely twisted “open  door in god’s name what’s  matter” cried  voicethe voice  black michael himself he  answered   very words i had written  my letter “help michaelhentzau” a fierce oath rang out   duke    loud thud  threw himself against  door at  same moment i heard  window above my head open   voice cried “what’s  matter”  i heard  man’s hasty footsteps i grasped my sword if de gautet came my way  six would  less  one more then i heard  clash  crossed swords   tramp  feet andi cannot tell  thing so quickly   happened  all seemed  come  once there   angry cry  madame’s room  cry   wounded man  window  flung open young rupert stood there sword  hand he turned his back  i saw his body go forward   lunge “ah johann there’s one  you come on michael” johann  there thencome   rescue   duke how would  open  door  me for i feared  rupert had slain him “help” cried  duke’s voice faint  husky i heard  step   stairs above me  i heard  stir down  my left   direction   king’s cell but before anything happened  my side   moat i saw five or six men round young rupert   embrasure  madame’s window three or four times  lunged  incomparable dash  dexterity for  instant they fell back leaving  ring round him he leapt   parapet   window laughing   leapt  waving his sword  his hand he  drunk  blood   laughed again wildly   flung himself headlong into  moat what became  him then i did not see    leapt de gautet’s lean face looked out through  door  me and without  second’s hesitation i struck  him  all  strength god had given me   fell dead   doorway without  word or  groan i dropped  my knees  him where   keys i found myself muttering “the keys man  keys”  though  had been yet alive  could listen  when i could not find them igod forgive mei believe i struck  dead man’s face at last i had them there  but three seizing  largest i felt  lock   door  led   cell i fitted   key it  right the lock turned i drew  door close behind me  locked   noiselessly  i could putting  key  my pocket i found myself   top   flight  steep stone stairs an oil lamp burnt dimly   bracket i took  down  held   my hand  i stood  listened “what   devil can  be” i heard  voice say it came  behind  door  faced me   bottom   stairs and another answered “shall we kill him” i strained  hear  answer  could have sobbed  relief when detchard’s voice came grating  cold “wait  bit there’ll  trouble if we strike too soon” there   moment’s silence then i heard  bolt   door cautiously drawn back instantly i put out  light i held replacing  lamp   bracket “it’s darkthe lamp’s out have you  light” said  other voicebersonin’s no doubt they had  light but they should not use it it  come   crisis now  i rushed down  steps  flung myself against  door bersonin had unbolted    gave way before me the belgian stood there sword  hand  detchard  sitting   couch   side   room in astonishment  seeing me bersonin recoiled detchard jumped  his sword i rushed madly   belgian  gave way before me  i drove him up against  wall he  no swordsman though  fought bravely    moment  lay   floor before me i turneddetchard  not there faithful  his orders  had not risked  fight  me but had rushed straight   door   king’s room opened   slammed  behind him even now    his work inside and surely  would have killed  king  perhaps me also had  not been  one devoted man who gave his life   king for when i forced  door  sight i saw  this  king stood   corner   room broken  his sickness  could do nothing his fettered hands moved uselessly up  down    laughing horribly  halfmad delirium detchard   doctor  together   middle   room   doctor had flung himself   murderer pinning his hands  his sides   instant then detchard wrenched himself free   feeble grip and  i entered drove his sword through  hapless man then  turned  me crying “at last” we  sword  sword by blessed chance neither  nor bersonin had been wearing their revolvers i found them afterwards ready loaded   mantelpiece   outer room   hard   door ready  their hands but my sudden rush  had cut off access  them yes we  man  man  we began  fight silently sternly  hard yet i remember little  it save   man  my match   swordnay  more   knew more tricks than i    forced me back against  bars  guarded  entrance  “jacob’s ladder” and i saw  smile  his face   wounded me   left arm no glory do i take   contest i believe   man would have mastered me  slain me  then done his butcher’s work     most skilful swordsman i have ever met but even   pressed me hard  halfmad wasted wan creature   corner leapt high  lunatic mirth shrieking “it’s cousin rudolf cousin rudolf i’ll help you cousin rudolf”  catching up  chair  his hands he could but just lift    ground  hold  uselessly before him  came towards us hope came  me “come on” i cried “come on drive  against his legs” detchard replied   savage thrust he all but had me “come on come on man” i cried “come  share  fun” and  king laughed gleefully  came on pushing his chair before him with  oath detchard skipped back and before i knew what   doing had turned his sword against  king he made one fierce cut   king   king   piteous cry dropped where  stood the stout ruffian turned  face me again but his own hand had prepared his destruction   turning  trod   pool  blood  flowed   dead physician he slipped  fell like  dart i  upon him i caught him   throat  before  could recover himself i drove my point through his neck    stifled curse  fell across  body  his victim was  king dead it  my first thought i rushed  where  lay ay  seemed  if   dead   had  great gash across his forehead   lay still   huddled heap   floor i dropped  my knees beside him  leant my ear down  hear if  breathed but before i could there   loud rattle   outside i knew  sound  drawbridge  being pushed out a moment later  rang home against  wall  my side   moat i should  caught   trap   king  me if  yet lived he must take his chance  live or die i took my sword  passed into  outer room who  pushing  drawbridge outmy men if so all  well my eye fell   revolvers  i seized one  paused  listen   doorway   outer room to listen say i yes   get my breath  i tore my shirt  twisted  strip   round my bleeding arm  stood listening again i would have given  world  hear sapt’s voice for i  faint spent  weary and  wildcat rupert hentzau  yet  large   castle yet because i could better defend  narrow door   top   stairs than  wider entrance   room i dragged myself up  steps  stood behind  listening what   sound again  strange one   place  time an easy scornful merry laughthe laugh  young rupert hentzau i could scarcely believe   sane man would laugh yet  laugh told me  my men had not come  they must have shot rupert ere now if they had come and  clock struck halfpast two my god the door had not been opened they had gone   bank they had not found me they had gone  now back  tarlenheim   news   king’s deathand mine well  would  true before they got there was not rupert laughing  triumph for  moment i sank unnerved against  door then i started up alert again  rupert cried scornfully “well  bridge  there come over it and  god’s name let’s see black michael keep back you curs michael come  fight  her” if    threecornered fight i might yet bear my part i turned  key   door  looked out chapter  face  face   forest for  moment i could see nothing   glare  lanterns  torches caught me full   eyes   other side   bridge but soon  scene grew clear     strange scene the bridge    place at  far end   stood  group   duke’s servants two or three carried  lights which had dazzled me three or four held pikes  rest they  huddled together their weapons  protruded before them their faces  pale  agitated to put  plainly they looked   arrant  fright  i have seen men look  they gazed apprehensively   man who stood   middle   bridge sword  hand rupert hentzau   his trousers  shirt  white linen  stained  blood but his easy buoyant pose told me    himself either not touched  all or merely scratched there  stood holding  bridge against them  daring them  come on or rather bidding them send black michael  him  they having no firearms cowered before  desperate man  dared not attack him they whispered  one another    backmost rank i saw my friend johann leaning against  portal   door  stanching   handkerchief  blood which flowed   wound  his cheek by marvellous chance i  master the cravens would oppose me no more than they dared attack rupert i had but  raise my revolver  i sent him  his account  his sins  his head he did not so much  know  i  there i did nothingwhy i hardly know  this day i had killed one man stealthily  night  another  luck rather than skillperhaps   that again villain   man was i did not relish being one   crowd against himperhaps   that but stronger than either  these restrained feelings came  curiosity   fascination which held me spellbound watching   outcome   scene “michael you dog michael if you can stand come on” cried rupert   advanced  step  group shrinking back  little before him “michael you bastard come on” the answer  his taunts came   wild cry   woman “he’s dead my god he’s dead” “dead” shouted rupert “i struck better than i knew”   laughed triumphantly then  went on “down  your weapons there i’m your master now down  them i say” i believe they would have obeyed but   spoke came new things first there arose  distant sound   shouts  knockings   other side   chateau my heart leapt it must  my men come   happy disobedience  seek me the noise continued but none   rest seemed  heed it their attention  chained  what now happened before their eyes the group  servants parted   woman staggered    bridge antoinette de mauban    loose white robe her dark hair streamed over her shoulders her face  ghastly pale  her eyes gleamed wildly   light   torches in her shaking hand she held  revolver and  she tottered forward she fired   rupert hentzau the ball missed him  struck  woodwork over my head “faith madame” laughed rupert “had your eyes been no more deadly than your shooting i had not been  this scrapenor black michael  helltonight” she took no notice  his words with  wonderful effort she calmed herself till she stood still  rigid then very slowly  deliberately she began  raise her arm again taking most careful aim he would  mad  risk it he must rush  her chancing  bullet or retreat towards me i covered him  my weapon he did neither before she had got her aim  bowed  his most graceful fashion cried “i can’t kill where i’ve kissed”  before she or i could stop him laid his hand   parapet   bridge  lightly leapt into  moat at  very moment i heard  rush  feet   voice i knewsapt’scry “god it’s  dukedead” then i knew   king needed me no more  throwing down my revolver i sprang out   bridge there   cry  wild wonder “the king”  then i like rupert  hentzau sword  hand vaulted over  parapet intent  finishing my quarrel  him where i saw his curly head fifteen yards off   water   moat he swam swiftly  easily i  weary  half crippled  my wounded arm i could not gain  him for  time i made no sound but  we rounded  corner   old keep i cried “stop rupert stop” i saw him look over his shoulder but  swam on he  under  bank now searching  i guessed   spot   could climb i knew there   nonebut there  my rope which would still  hanging where i had left it he would come  where   before i could perhaps  would miss itperhaps  would find it  if  drew  up after him  would get  good start  me i put forth all my remaining strength  pressed on at last i began  gain  him  he occupied  his search unconsciously slackened his pace ah  had found it a low shout  triumph came  him he laid hold    began  haul himself up i  near enough  hear him mutter “how  devil comes this here” i    rope  he hanging  mid air saw me but i could not reach him “hullo who’s here”  cried  startled tones for  moment i believe  took me   kingi dare say i  pale enough  lend colour   thought but  instant later  cried “why it’s  playactor how come you here man” and so saying  gained  bank i laid hold   rope but i paused he stood   bank sword  hand   could cut my head open or spit me through  heart  i came up i let go  rope “never mind” said i “but  i am here i think i’ll stay” he smiled down  me “these women   deuce”  began when suddenly  great bell   castle started  ring furiously   loud shout reached us   moat rupert smiled again  waved his hand  me “i should like  turn  you but it’s  little too hot” said he   disappeared  above me in  instant without thinking  danger i laid my hand   rope i  up i saw him thirty yards off running like  deer towards  shelter   forest for once rupert hentzau had chosen discretion  his part i laid my feet   ground  rushed after him calling  him  stand he would not unwounded  vigorous  gained  me  every step but forgetting everything   world except him  my thirst  his blood i pressed on  soon  deep shades   forest  zenda engulfed us both pursued  pursuer it  three o’clock now  day  dawning i    long straight grass avenue   hundred yards ahead ran young rupert his curls waving   fresh breeze i  weary  panting  looked over his shoulder  waved his hand again  me he  mocking me   saw  had  pace  me i  forced  pause  breath a moment later rupert turned sharply   right   lost  my sight i thought all  over   deep vexation sank   ground but i  up again directly   scream rang through  foresta woman’s scream putting forth  last  my strength i ran    place where  had turned out  my sight and turning also i saw him again but alas i could not touch him he    act  lifting  girl down  her horse doubtless   her scream  i heard she looked like  small farmer’s or  peasant’s daughter  she carried  basket  her arm probably she   her way   early market  zenda her horse   stout well shaped animal master rupert lifted her down amid her shrieksthe sight  him frightened her but  treated her gently laughed kissed her  gave her money then  jumped   horse sitting sideways like  woman  then  waited  me i  my part waited  him presently  rode towards me keeping his distance however he lifted up his hand saying “what did you   castle” “i killed three  your friends” said i “what you got   cells” “yes” “and  king” “he  hurt  detchard before i killed detchard but i pray   lives” “you fool” said rupert pleasantly “one thing more i did” “and what’s that” “i spared your life i  behind you   bridge   revolver  my hand” “no faith i  between two fires” “get off your horse” i cried “and fight like  man” “before  lady” said he pointing   girl “fie your majesty” then  my rage hardly knowing what i did i rushed  him for  moment  seemed  waver then  reined his horse   stood waiting  me on i went  my folly i seized  bridle  i struck  him he parried  thrust  me i fell back  pace  rushed  him again  this time i reached his face  laid his cheek open  darted back almost before  could strike me he seemed almost dazed   fierceness  my attack otherwise i think  must have killed me i sank  my knee panting expecting him  ride  me and so  would have done  then  there i doubt not one or both  us would have died but   moment there came  shout  behind us and looking round i saw just   turn   avenue  man   horse he  riding hard   carried  revolver  his hand it  fritz von tarlenheim my faithful friend rupert saw him  knew   game  up he checked his rush  me  flung his leg over  saddle but yet  just  moment  waited leaning forward  tossed his hair off his forehead  smiled  said “au revoir rudolf rassendyll” then  his cheek streaming blood but his lips laughing  his body swaying  ease  grace  bowed  me   bowed   farmgirl who had drawn near  trembling fascination   waved his hand  fritz who  just within range  let fly  shot  him the ball came nigh doing  work   struck  sword  held   dropped  sword   oath wringing his fingers  clapped his heels hard  his horse’s belly  rode away   gallop and i watched him go down  long avenue riding  though  rode  his pleasure  singing   went  all there   gash  his cheek once again  turned  wave his hand  then  gloom  thickets swallowed him    lost  our sight thus  vanishedreckless  wary graceful  graceless handsome debonair vile  unconquered and i flung my sword passionately   ground  cried  fritz  ride after him but fritz stopped his horse  leapt down  ran  me  knelt putting his arm about me and indeed   time   wound  detchard had given me  broken forth afresh  my blood  staining  ground “then give me  horse” i cried staggering  my feet  throwing his arms off me and  strength  my rage carried me so far  where  horse stood  then i fell prone beside it and fritz knelt  me again “fritz” i said “ay frienddear friend”  said tender   woman “is  king alive” he took his handkerchief  wiped my lips  bent  kissed me   forehead “thanks   most gallant gentleman  lives” said  softly “the king  alive” the little farmgirl stood  us weeping  fright  wideeyed  wonder  she had seen me  zenda   not i pallid dripping foul  bloody  i wasyet  not i  king and when i heard   king  alive i strove  cry “hurrah” but i could not speak  i laid my head back  fritz’s arms  closed my eyes  i groaned  then lest fritz should do me wrong  his thoughts i opened my eyes  tried  say “hurrah” again but i could not and being very tired  now very cold i huddled myself close up  fritz  get  warmth  him  shut my eyes again  went  sleep chapter  the prisoner   king in order   full understanding  what had occurred   castle  zenda   necessary  supplement my account  what i myself saw  did   night  relating briefly what i afterwards learnt  fritz  madame de mauban the story told   latter explained clearly how  happened   cry which i had arranged   stratagem   sham had come  dreadful reality before  time  had thus   seemed   moment ruined our hopes while   end  had favoured them the unhappy woman fired i believe   genuine attachment   duke  strelsau no less than   dazzling prospects which  dominion over him opened before her eyes had followed him  his request  paris  ruritania he   man  strong passions but  stronger will  his cool head ruled both he  content  take all  give nothing when she arrived she  not long  finding  she had  rival   princess flavia rendered desperate she stood  nothing which might give or keep  her her power over  duke as i say  took  gave not simultaneously antoinette found herself entangled  his audacious schemes unwilling  abandon him bound  him   chains  shame  hope yet she would not   decoy nor  his bidding lure me  death hence  letters  warning she had written whether  lines she sent  flavia  inspired  good or bad feeling  jealousy or  pity i do not know but here also she served us well when  duke went  zenda she accompanied him  here   first time she learnt  full measure  his cruelty   touched  compassion   unfortunate king from this time she   us yet  what she told me i know  she still as women will loved michael  trusted  gain his life if not his pardon   king   reward  her assistance his triumph she did not desire  she loathed his crime  loathed yet more fiercely what would   prize  ithis marriage  his cousin princess flavia at zenda new forces came into playthe lust  daring  young rupert he  caught  her beauty perhaps perhaps   enough  him  she belonged  another man   she hated him for many days there had been quarrels  ill  between him   duke   scene which i had witnessed   duke’s room  but one  many rupert’s proposals  me  which she had  course been ignorant  no way surprised her when i related them she had herself warned michael against rupert even when she  calling  me  deliver her  both  them on this night then rupert had determined  have his will when she had gone  her room he having furnished himself   key  it had made his entrance her cries had brought  duke  there   dark room while she screamed  men had fought  rupert having wounded his master   mortal blow had   servants rushing in escaped through  window  i have described the duke’s blood spurting out had stained his opponent’s shirt but rupert not knowing   had dealt michael his death  eager  finish  encounter how  meant  deal   other three   band i know not i dare say  did not think   killing  michael  not premeditated antoinette left alone   duke had tried  stanch his wound  thus  she busied till  died  then hearing rupert’s taunts she had come forth  avenge him me she had not seen nor did she till i darted out  my ambush  leapt after rupert into  moat the same moment found my friends   scene they had reached  chateau  due time  waited ready   door but johann swept   rest   rescue   duke did not open it nay  took  part against rupert putting himself forward more bravely than any  his anxiety  avert suspicion   had received  wound   embrasure   window till nearly halfpast two sapt waited then following my orders  had sent fritz  search  banks   moat i  not there hastening back fritz told sapt  sapt   following orders still  riding  full speed back  tarlenheim while fritz would not hear  abandoning me let me have ordered what i would on this they disputed some few minutes then sapt persuaded  fritz detached  party under bernenstein  gallop back  tarlenheim  bring up  marshal while  rest fell    great door   chateau for several minutes  resisted them then just  antoinette de mauban fired  rupert  hentzau   bridge they broke in eight  them  all   first door they came    door  michael’s room  michael lay dead across  threshold   swordthrust through his breast sapt cried out  his death  i had heard  they rushed   servants but these  fear dropped their weapons  antoinette flung herself weeping  sapt’s feet and all she cried   i had been   end   bridge  leapt off “what   prisoner” asked sapt but she shook her head then sapt  fritz   gentlemen behind them crossed  bridge slowly warily  without noise  fritz stumbled over  body  de gautet   way   door they felt him  found him dead then they consulted listening eagerly  any sound   cells below but there came none  they  greatly afraid   king’s guards had killed him  having pushed his body through  great pipe had escaped  same way themselves yet because i had been seen here they had still some hope thus indeed fritz  his friendship told me  going back  michael’s body pushing aside antoinette who prayed  it they found  key   door which i had locked  opened  door the staircase  dark  they would not use  torch  first lest they should  more exposed  fire but soon fritz cried “the door down there  open see there  light” so they went  boldly  found none  oppose them and when they came   outer room  saw  belgian bersonin lying dead they thanked god sapt saying “ay   been here” then rushing into  king’s cell they found detchard lying dead across  dead physician   king  his back  his chair  him and fritz cried “he’s dead”  sapt drove all out   room except fritz  knelt down   king and having learnt more  wounds   sign  death than i  soon knew   king  not dead nor if properly attended would die and they covered his face  carried him  duke michael’s room  laid him there  antoinette rose  praying   body   duke  went  bathe  king’s head  dress his wounds till  doctor came and sapt seeing i had been there  having heard antoinette’s story sent fritz  search  moat  then  forest he dared send no one else and fritz found my horse  feared  worst then  i have told  found me guided   shout  which i had called  rupert  stop  face me and i think  man  never been more glad  find his own brother alive than  fritz  come  me so that  love  anxiety  me  thought nothing   thing so great  would have been  death  rupert hentzau yet had fritz killed him i should have grudged it the enterprise   king’s rescue being thus prosperously concluded  lay  colonel sapt  secure secrecy    king ever having been  need  rescue antoinette de mauban  johann  keeper who indeed  too much hurt   wagging his tongue just now  sworn  reveal nothing  fritz went forth  findnot  king but  unnamed friend   king who had lain  zenda  flashed   moment before  dazed eyes  duke michael’s servants   drawbridge the metamorphosis had happened   king wounded almost  death   attacks   gaolers who guarded his friend had  last overcome them  rested now wounded but alive  black michael’s own room   castle there  had been carried his face covered   cloak   cell  thence orders issued  if his friend  found  should  brought directly  privately   king   meanwhile messengers should ride  full speed  tarlenheim  tell marshall strakencz  assure  princess   king’s safety   come himself  all speed  greet  king the princess  enjoined  remain  tarlenheim  there await her cousin’s coming or his further injunctions thus  king would come  his own again having wrought brave deeds  escaped almost   miracle  treacherous assault  his unnatural brother this ingenious arrangement  my longheaded old friend prospered  every way save where  encountered  force  often defeats  most cunning schemes i mean nothing else than  pleasure   woman for let her cousin  sovereign send what command  chose or colonel sapt chose  him  let marshal strakencz insist   would  princess flavia   no way minded  rest  tarlenheim while her lover lay wounded  zenda  when  marshal   small suite rode forth  tarlenheim   way  zenda  princess’s carriage followed immediately behind   this order they passed through  town where  report  already rife   king going  night before  remonstrate  his brother  all friendliness    held one   king’s friends  confinement   castle had been most traitorously set upon  there had been  desperate conflict   duke  slain  several  his gentlemen    king wounded   was had seized  held  castle  zenda all  which talk made  may  supposed  mighty excitement   wires  set  motion   tidings came  strelsau only just after orders had been sent thither  parade  troops  overawe  dissatisfied quarters   town   display  force thus  princess flavia came  zenda and  she drove up  hill   marshal riding   wheel  still imploring her  return  obedience   king’s orders fritz von tarlenheim   prisoner  zenda came   edge   forest i had revived  my swoon  walked resting  fritz’s arm  looking out   cover   trees i saw  princess suddenly understanding   glance  my companion’s face  we must not meet her i sank  my knees behind  clump  bushes but there  one whom we had forgotten but who followed us   not disposed  let slip  chance  earning  smile  maybe  crown or two and while we lay hidden  little farmgirl came  us  ran   princess curtseying  crying “madame  king  herein  bushes may i guide you  him madame” “nonsense child” said old strakencz “the king lies wounded   castle” “yes sir he’s wounded i know but he’s therewith count fritzand not   castle” she persisted “is   two places or  there two kings” asked flavia bewildered “and how should   there” “he pursued  gentleman madame  they fought till count fritz came   other gentleman took my father’s horse  me  rode away but  king  here  count fritz why madame  there another man  ruritania like  king” “no my child” said flavia softly i  told  afterwards  she smiled  gave  girl money “i  go  see this gentleman”  she rose  alight   carriage but  this moment sapt came riding   castle and seeing  princess made  best   bad job  cried  her   king  well tended   no danger “in  castle” she asked “where else madame” said he bowing “but this girl says   yonderwith count fritz” sapt turned his eyes   child   incredulous smile “every fine gentleman   king  such” said he “why he’s  like  king  one pea  another madame” cried  girl  little shaken but still obstinate sapt started round the old marshal’s face asked unspoken questions flavia’s glance  no less eloquent suspicion spread quick “i’ll ride myself  see this man” said sapt hastily “nay i’ll come myself” said  princess “then come alone”  whispered and she obedient   strange hinting  his face prayed  marshal   rest  wait  she  sapt came  foot towards where we lay sapt waving   farmgirl  keep   distance and when i saw them coming i sat   sad heap   ground  buried my face  my hands i could not look  her fritz knelt  me laying his hand  my shoulder “speak low whatever you say” i heard sapt whisper  they came up   next thing i heard   low cryhalf  joy half  fearfrom  princess “it  he are you hurt” and she fell   ground  me  gently pulled my hands away but i kept my eyes   ground “it   king” she said “pray colonel sapt tell me where lay  wit   joke you played  me” we answered none  us we three  silent before her regardless  them she threw her arms round my neck  kissed me then sapt spoke   low hoarse whisper “it  not  king don’t kiss him he’s not  king” she drew back   moment then   arm still round my neck she asked  superb indignation “do i not know my love rudolf my love” “it  not  king” said old sapt again   sudden sob broke  tenderhearted fritz it   sob  told her no comedy  afoot “he   king” she cried “it   king’s facethe king’s ringmy ring it  my love” “your love madame” said old sapt “but not  king the king  there   castle this gentleman” “look  me rudolf look  me” she cried taking my face between her hands “why do you let them torment me tell me what  means” then i spoke gazing into her eyes “god forgive me madame” i said “i am not  king” i felt her hands clutch my cheeks she gazed  me  never man’s face  scanned yet and i silent again saw wonder born  doubt grow  terror spring  life  she looked and very gradually  grasp  her hands slackened she turned  sapt  fritz  back  me then suddenly she reeled forward  fell  my arms    great cry  pain i gathered her  me  kissed her lips sapt laid his hand  my arm i looked up  his face and i laid her softly   ground  stood up looking  her cursing heaven  young rupert’s sword had spared me  this sharper pang chapter  if love  all it  night  i    cell wherein  king had lain   castle  zenda the great pipe  rupert  hentzau had nicknamed “jacob’s ladder”  gone   lights   room across  moat twinkled   darkness all  still  din  clash  strife  gone i had spent  day hidden   forest   time when fritz had led me off leaving sapt   princess under cover  dusk muffled up i had been brought   castle  lodged where i now lay though three men had died theretwo  them  my handi  not troubled  ghosts i had thrown myself   pallet   window   looking out   black water johann  keeper still pale  his wound but not much hurt besides had brought me supper he told me   king  doing well   had seen  princess  she  he sapt  fritz had been long together marshal strakencz  gone  strelsau black michael lay  his coffin  antoinette de mauban watched  him had i not heard   chapel priests singing mass  him outside there  strange rumours afloat some said   prisoner  zenda  dead some   had vanished yet alive some     friend who had served  king well  some adventure  england others   had discovered  duke’s plots  had therefore been kidnapped  him one or two shrewd fellows shook their heads  said only  they would say nothing but they had suspicions  more    known than  known if colonel sapt would tell all  knew thus johann chattered till i sent him away  lay there alone thinking not   future butas  man  wont  do when stirring things have happened  himrehearsing  events   past weeks  wondering how strangely they had fallen out and above me   stillness   night i heard  standards flapping against their poles  black michael’s banner hung there halfmast high  above   royal flag  ruritania floating  one night more over my head habit grows so quick  only   effort did i recollect   floated no longer  me presently fritz von tarlenheim came into  room i  standing then   window  glass  opened  i  idly fingering  cement which clung   masonry where “jacob’s ladder” had been he told me briefly   king wanted me  together we crossed  drawbridge  entered  room  had been black michael’s the king  lying there  bed our doctor  tarlenheim   attendance  him  whispered  me  my visit must  brief the king held out his hand  shook mine fritz   doctor withdrew   window i took  king’s ring  my finger  placed   his “i have tried not  dishonour it sire” said i “i can’t talk much  you”  said   weak voice “i have had  great fight  sapt   marshalfor we have told  marshal everything i wanted  take you  strelsau  keep you  me  tell everyone  what you had done  you would have been my best  nearest friend cousin rudolf but they tell me i must not    secret must  keptif kept  can be” “they  right sire let me go my work here  done” “yes   done  no man but you could have done it when they see me again i shall have my beard on i shallyes faith i shall  wasted  sickness they  not wonder   king looks changed  face cousin i shall try  let them find him changed  nothing else you have shown me how  play  king” “sire” said i “i can take no praise  you it    narrowest grace  god  i  not  worse traitor than your brother” he turned inquiring eyes  me but  sick man shrinks  puzzles   had no strength  question me his glance fell  flavia’s ring which i wore i thought  would question me about it but after fingering  idly  let his head fall  his pillow “i don’t know when i shall see you again”  said faintly almost listlessly “if i can ever serve you again sire” i answered his eyelids closed fritz came   doctor i kissed  king’s hand  let fritz lead me away i have never seen  king since outside fritz turned not   right back towards  drawbridge but   left  without speaking led me upstairs through  handsome corridor   chateau “where  we going” i asked looking away  me fritz answered “she  sent  you when   over come back   bridge i’ll wait  you there” “what does she want” said i breathing quickly he shook his head “does she know everything” “yes everything” he opened  door  gently pushing me in closed  behind me i found myself   drawingroom small  richly furnished at first i thought  i  alone   light  came   pair  shaded candles   mantelpiece  very dim but presently i discerned  woman’s figure standing   window i knew    princess  i walked up  her fell  one knee  carried  hand  hung  her side  my lips she neither moved nor spoke i rose  my feet and piercing  gloom  my eager eyes saw her pale face   gleam  her hair  before i knew i spoke softly “flavia” she trembled  little  looked round then she darted  me taking hold  me “don’t stand don’t stand no you mustn’t you’re hurt sit downhere here” she made me sit   sofa  put her hand  my forehead “how hot your head is” she said sinking  her knees  me then she laid her head against me  i heard her murmur “my darling how hot your head is” somehow love gives even   dull man  knowledge  his lover’s heart i had come  humble myself  pray pardon  my presumption but what i said now was “i love you  all my heart  soul” for what troubled  shamed her not her love  me but  fear  i had counterfeited  lover  i had acted  king  taken her kisses   smothered smile “with all my life  heart” said i  she clung  me “always   first moment i saw you   cathedral there  been but one woman   world  meand there   no other but god forgive me  wrong i’ve done you” “they made you do it” she said quickly  she added raising her head  looking  my eyes “it might have made no difference if i’d known it it  always you never  king” “i meant  tell you” said i “i  going    night   ball  strelsau when sapt interrupted me after that i couldn’ti couldn’t risk losing you beforebeforei must my darling  you i nearly left  king  die” “i know i know what  we  do now rudolf” i put my arm round her  held her up while i said “i am going away tonight” “ah no no” she cried “not tonight” “i must go tonight before more people have seen me and how would you have me stay sweetheart except” “if i could come  you” she whispered very low “my god” said i roughly “don’t talk about that”  i thrust her  little back  me “why not i love you you   good  gentleman   king” then i  false  all  i should have held by for i caught her  my arms  prayed her  words  i  not write  come  me daring all ruritania  take her  me and   while she listened  wondering dazzled eyes but  her eyes looked  me i grew ashamed  my voice died away  broken murmurs  stammerings   last i  silent she drew herself away  me  stood against  wall while i sat   edge   sofa trembling  every limb knowing what i had doneloathing it obstinate not  undo it so we rested  long time “i am mad” i said sullenly “i love your madness dear” she answered her face  away  me but i caught  sparkle   tear  her cheek i clutched  sofa  my hand  held myself there “is love  only thing” she asked  low sweet tones  seemed  bring  calm even  my wrung heart “if love   only thing i would follow youin rags if need beto  world’s end  you hold my heart   hollow  your hand but  love  only thing” i made no answer it gives me shame now  think  i would not help her she came near me  laid her hand  my shoulder i put my hand up  held hers “i know people write  talk  if  were perhaps  some fate lets  be ah if i  one  them but if love had been  only thing you would have let  king die  his cell” i kissed her hand “honour binds  woman too rudolf my honour lies  being true  my country  my house i don’t know why god  let me love you but i know  i must stay” still i said nothing  she pausing  while then went on “your ring  always   my finger your heart  my heart  touch  your lips  mine but you must go  i must stay perhaps i must do what  kills me  think  doing” i knew what she meant   shiver ran through me but i could not utterly fail her i rose  took her hand “do what you will or what you must” i said “i think god shows his purposes  such  you my part  lighter  your ring shall   my finger  your heart  mine  no touch save  your lips  ever   mine so may god comfort you my darling” there struck  our ears  sound  singing the priests   chapel  singing masses   souls  those who lay dead they seemed  chant  requiem over our buried joy  pray forgiveness  our love  would not die the soft sweet pitiful music rose  fell  we stood opposite one another her hands  mine “my queen  my beauty” said i “my lover  true knight” she said “perhaps we shall never see one another again kiss me my dear  go” i kissed her  she bade me but   last she clung  me whispering nothing but my name   over  over againand againand again  then i left her rapidly i walked down   bridge sapt  fritz  waiting  me under their directions i changed my dress  muffling my face  i had done more than once before i mounted  them   door   castle  we three rode through  night     breaking day  found ourselves   little roadside station just over  border  ruritania the train  not quite due  i walked  them   meadow   little brook while we waited  it they promised  send me all news they overwhelmed me  kindnesseven old sapt  touched  gentleness while fritz  half unmanned i listened   kind  dream  all they said “rudolf rudolf rudolf” still rang  my earsa burden  sorrow   love at last they saw  i could not heed them  we walked up  down  silence till fritz touched me   arm  i saw  mile or more away  blue smoke   train then i held out  hand  each  them “we  all but halfmen this morning” said i smiling “but we have been men eh sapt  fritz old friends we have run  good course between us” “we have defeated traitors  set  king firm  his throne” said sapt then fritz von tarlenheim suddenly before i could discern his purpose or stay him uncovered his head  bent   used  do  kissed my hand   i snatched  away  said trying  laugh “heaven doesn’t always make  right men kings” old sapt twisted his mouth   wrung my hand “the devil  his share  most things” said he the people   station looked curiously   tall man   muffled face but we took no notice  their glances i stood  my two friends  waited till  train came up  us then we shook hands again saying nothing  both this timeand indeed  old sapt  seemed strangebared their heads  so stood still till  train bore me away  their sight so    thought some great man travelled privately  his pleasure   little station  morning whereas  truth   only i rudolf rassendyll  english gentleman  cadet   good house but  man  no wealth nor position nor  much rank they would have been disappointed  know that yet had they known all they would have looked more curiously still for  i what i might now i had been  three months  king which if not  thing   proud of   least  experience  have undergone doubtless i should have thought more  it had there not echoed through  air   towers  zenda  we  leaving far away into my ears  into my heart  cry   woman’s love“rudolf rudolf rudolf” hark i hear  now chapter  present pastand future the details  my return home can have but little interest i went straight   tyrol  spent  quiet fortnightmostly  my back   severe chill developed itself  i  also  victim   nervous reaction which made me weak   baby as soon  i had reached my quarters i sent  apparently careless postcard  my brother announcing my good health  prospective return that would serve  satisfy  inquiries   my whereabouts which  probably still vexing  prefect   police  strelsau i let my moustache  imperial grow again   hair comes quickly  my face they  respectable though not luxuriant   time  i landed myself  paris  called  my friend george featherly my interview  him  chiefly remarkable   number  unwilling but necessary falsehoods  i told  i rallied him unmercifully when  told me   had made up his mind  i had gone   track  madame de mauban  strelsau the lady  appeared  back  paris but  living  great seclusiona fact  which gossip found no difficulty  accounting did not all  world know   treachery  death  duke michael nevertheless george bade bertram bertrand   good cheer “for” said  flippantly “a live poet  better than  dead duke” then  turned  me  asked “what have you been doing  your moustache” “to tell  truth” i answered assuming  sly air “a man now  then  reasons  wishing  alter his appearance but it’s coming  very well again” “what then i wasn’t so far out if not  fair antoinette there   charmer” “there  always  charmer” said i sententiously but george would not  satisfied till  had wormed out  me he took much pride  his ingenuity  absolutely imaginary loveaffair attended   proper soupçon  scandal which had kept me all this time   peaceful regions   tyrol in return  this narrative george regaled me   great deal  what  called “inside information” known only  diplomatists    true course  events  ruritania  plots  counterplots in his opinion  told me   significant nod there  more   said  black michael than  public supposed   hinted   wellfounded suspicion   mysterious prisoner  zenda concerning whom  good many paragraphs had appeared  not  man  all but here i had much ado not  smile  woman disguised   man   strife between  king  his brother  this imaginary lady’s favour    bottom  their quarrel “perhaps   madame de mauban herself” i suggested “no” said george decisively “antoinette de mauban  jealous  her  betrayed  duke   king   reason and  confirm what i say it’s well known   princess flavia  now extremely cold   king after having been most affectionate” at this point i changed  subject  escaped  george’s “inspired” delusions but if diplomatists never know anything more than they had succeeded  finding out  this instance they appear  me   somewhat expensive luxuries while  paris i wrote  antoinette though i did not venture  call upon her i received  return  very affecting letter  which she assured me   king’s generosity  kindness no less than her regard  me bound her conscience  absolute secrecy she expressed  intention  settling   country  withdrawing herself entirely  society whether she carried out her designs i have never heard but  i have not met her or heard news  her up  this time   probable  she did there  no doubt  she  deeply attached   duke  strelsau  her conduct   time  his death proved  no knowledge   man’s real character  enough  root her regard  him out  her heart i had one more battle left  fighta battle  would i knew  severe   bound  end  my complete defeat was i not back   tyrol without having made any study   inhabitants institutions scenery fauna flora or other features had i not simply wasted my time  my usual frivolous goodfornothing way that   aspect   matter which i  obliged  admit would present itself  my sisterinlaw  against  verdict based  such evidence i had really no defence  offer it may  supposed then  i presented myself  park lane   shamefaced sheepish fashion on  whole my reception  not so alarming  i had feared it turned out  i had done not what rose wished butthe next best thingwhat she prophesied she had declared  i should make no notes record no observations gather no materials my brother   other hand had been weak enough  maintain   serious resolve had  length animated me when i returned emptyhanded rose  so occupied  triumphing over burlesdon  she let me down quite easily devoting  greater part  her reproaches  my failure  advertise my friends  my whereabouts “we’ve wasted  lot  time trying  find you” she said “i know you have” said i “half our ambassadors have led weary lives  my account george featherly told me so but why should you have been anxious i can take care  myself” “oh  wasn’t that” she cried scornfully “but i wanted  tell you about sir jacob borrodaile you know he’s got  embassyat least   have   monthand  wrote  say  hoped you would go  him” “where’s  going to” “he’s going  succeed lord topham  strelsau” said she “you couldn’t have  nicer place short  paris” “strelsau h’m” said i glancing  my brother “oh that doesn’t matter” exclaimed rose impatiently “now you  go won’t you” “i don’t know  i care about it” “oh you’re too exasperating” “and i don’t think i can go  strelsau my dear rose would  besuitable” “oh nobody remembers  horrid old story now” upon this i took out  my pocket  portrait   king  ruritania it had been taken  month or two before  ascended  throne she could not miss my point when i said putting  into her hands “in case you’ve not seen or not noticed  picture  rudolf v there  is don’t you think they might recall  story if i appeared   court  ruritania” my sisterinlaw looked   portrait  then  me “good gracious” she said  flung  photograph down   table “what do you say bob” i asked burlesdon got up went   corner   room  searched   heap  newspapers presently  came back   copy   illustrated london news opening  paper  displayed  doublepage engraving   coronation  rudolf v  strelsau the photograph   picture  laid side  side i sat   table fronting them and  i looked i grew absorbed my eye travelled  my own portrait  sapt  strakencz   rich robes   cardinal  black michael’s face   stately figure   princess  his side long i looked  eagerly i  roused  my brother’s hand  my shoulder he  gazing down  me   puzzled expression “it’s  remarkable likeness you see” said i “i really think i had better not go  ruritania” rose though half convinced would not abandon her position “it’s just  excuse” she said pettishly “you don’t want  do anything why you might become  ambassador” “i don’t think i want    ambassador” said i “it’s more than you ever  be” she retorted that  very likely true but   not more than i have been the idea  being  ambassador could scarcely dazzle me i had been  king so pretty rose left us  dudgeon  burlesdon lighting  cigarette looked  me still   curious gaze “that picture   paper”  said “well what  it it shows   king  ruritania  your humble servant   like  two peas” my brother shook his head “i suppose so”  said “but i should know you   man   photograph” “and not   picture   paper” “i should know  photograph   picture  picture’s very like  photograph but” “well” “it’s more like you” said my brother my brother   good man  trueso that  all     married man  mighty fond  his wife  should know any secret  mine but this secret  not mine  i could not tell   him “i don’t think it’s so much like me   photograph” said i boldly “but anyhow bob i won’t go  strelsau” “no don’t go  strelsau rudolf” said he and whether  suspects anything or   glimmer   truth i do not know if  has  keeps   himself    i never refer  it and we let sir jacob borrodaile find another attache since all these events
