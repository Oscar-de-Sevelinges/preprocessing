first inauguration   president under our national constitution during  period fifteen different  greatly distinguished citizens have  succession administered  executive branch   government they have conducted  through many perils  generally  great success yet  all this scope  precedent i now enter upon  same task   brief constitutional term  four years under great  peculiar difficulty a disruption   federal union heretofore only menaced  now formidably attempted i hold that  contemplation  universal law    constitution  union  these states  perpetual perpetuity  implied if not expressed   fundamental law  all national governments it  safe  assert  no government proper ever had  provision   organic law   own termination continue  execute all  express provisions  our national

nature  contract merely can it   contract  peaceably unmade  less than all  parties who made it one party   contract may violate itbreak it so  speak but does  not require all  lawfully rescind it descending  these general principles we find  proposition   legal contemplation  union  perpetual confirmed   history   union itself the union  much older than  constitution it  formed  fact   articles  association   it  matured  continued   declaration  independence   it  further matured   faith  all  then thirteen states expressly plighted  engaged   should  perpetual   articles  confederation   and finally   one   declared objects  ordaining  establishing  constitution  to form a more perfect union but if  destruction   union  one or   part only   states  lawfully possible

no attempt  force obnoxious strangers among  people   object while  strict legal right may exist   government  enforce  exercise  these offices  attempt  do so would  so irritating  so nearly impracticable withal  i deem  better  forego   time  uses  such offices the mails unless repelled  continue   furnished  all parts   union so far  possible  people everywhere shall have  sense

persons  one section or another who seek  destroy  union  all events   glad  any pretext  do it i  neither affirm nor deny but if there  such i need address no word  them to those however who really

case  secede rather than acquiesce they make  precedent which  turn  divide  ruin them   minority  their own  secede  them whenever  majority refuses   controlled  such minority for instance why may not any portion   new confederacy  year or two hence arbitrarily secede again precisely  portions   present union now claim  secede  it all who cherish disunion sentiments  now being educated   exact
