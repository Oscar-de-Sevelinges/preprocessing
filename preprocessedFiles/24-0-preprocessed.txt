beautiful and delicate work there is the perfection that endures prairie spring evening   flat land rich  sombre  always silent the miles  freshplowed soil heavy  black full  strength  harshness the growing wheat  growing weeds the toiling horses  tired men the long empty roads sullen fires  sunset fading the eternal unresponsive sky against all this youth flaming like  wild roses singing like  larks over  plowed fields flashing like  star out   twilight youth   insupportable sweetness its fierce necessity its sharp desire singing  singing out   lips  silence out   earthy dusk part i the wild land i one january day thirty years ago  little town  hanover anchored   windy nebraska tableland  trying not   blown away a mist  fine snowflakes  curling  eddying about  cluster  low drab buildings huddled   gray prairie under  gray sky the dwellinghouses  set about haphazard   tough prairie sod some  them looked  if they had been moved  overnight  others  if they  straying off  themselves headed straight   open plain none  them had any appearance  permanence   howling wind blew under them  well  over them the main street   deeply rutted road now frozen hard which ran   squat red railway station   grain “elevator”   north end   town   lumber yard   horse pond   south end on either side  this road straggled two uneven rows  wooden buildings  general merchandise stores  two banks  drug store  feed store  saloon  postoffice the board sidewalks  gray  trampled snow but  two o’clock   afternoon  shopkeepers having come back  dinner  keeping well behind their frosty windows the children  all  school  there  nobody abroad   streets but  few roughlooking countrymen  coarse overcoats  their long caps pulled down  their noses some  them had brought their wives  town  now  then  red or  plaid shawl flashed out  one store into  shelter  another at  hitchbars along  street  few heavy workhorses harnessed  farm wagons shivered under their blankets about  station everything  quiet  there would not  another train  until night on  sidewalk  front  one   stores sat  little swede boy crying bitterly he  about five years old his black cloth coat  much too big  him  made him look like  little old man his shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times  left  long stretch  stocking between  hem  his skirt   tops  his clumsy coppertoed shoes his cap  pulled down over his ears his nose  his chubby cheeks  chapped  red  cold he cried quietly   few people who hurried  did not notice him he  afraid  stop any one afraid  go into  store  ask  help so  sat wringing his long sleeves  looking up  telegraph pole beside him whimpering “my kitten oh my kitten her  fweeze” at  top   pole crouched  shivering gray kitten mewing faintly  clinging desperately   wood  her claws the boy had been left   store while his sister went   doctor’s office   her absence  dog had chased his kitten up  pole the little creature had never been so high before  she  too frightened  move her master  sunk  despair he   little country boy  this village   him  very strange  perplexing place where people wore fine clothes  had hard hearts he always felt shy  awkward here  wanted  hide behind things  fear some one might laugh  him just now   too unhappy  care who laughed at last  seemed  see  ray  hope his sister  coming   got up  ran toward her  his heavy shoes his sister   tall strong girl  she walked rapidly  resolutely  if she knew exactly where she  going  what she  going  do next she wore  man’s long ulster not  if    affliction but  if   very comfortable  belonged  her carried  like  young soldier   round plush cap tied down   thick veil she had  serious thoughtful face  her clear deep blue eyes  fixed intently   distance without seeming  see anything  if she   trouble she did not notice  little boy until  pulled her   coat then she stopped short  stooped down  wipe his wet face “why emil i told you  stay   store  not  come out what   matter  you” “my kitten sister my kitten a man put her out   dog chased her up there” his forefinger projecting   sleeve  his coat pointed up   wretched little creature   pole “oh emil didn’t i tell you she’d get us into trouble  some kind if you brought her what made you tease me so but there i ought  have known better myself” she went   foot   pole  held out her arms crying “kitty kitty kitty” but  kitten only mewed  faintly waved  tail alexandra turned away decidedly “no she won’t come down somebody  have  go up after her i saw  linstrums’ wagon  town i’ll go  see if i can find carl maybe  can do something only you must stop crying or i won’t go  step where’s your comforter did you leave    store never mind hold still till i put this  you” she unwound  brown veil  her head  tied  about his throat a shabby little traveling man who  just then coming out   store  his way   saloon stopped  gazed stupidly   shining mass  hair she bared when she took off her veil two thick braids pinned about her head   german way   fringe  reddishyellow curls blowing out  under her cap he took his cigar out  his mouth  held  wet end between  fingers  his woolen glove “my god girl what  head  hair”  exclaimed quite innocently  foolishly she stabbed him   glance  amazonian fierceness  drew  her lower lip—most unnecessary severity it gave  little clothing drummer such  start   actually let his cigar fall   sidewalk  went off weakly   teeth   wind   saloon his hand  still unsteady when  took his glass   bartender his feeble flirtatious instincts had been crushed before but never so mercilessly he felt cheap  illused  if some one had taken advantage  him when  drummer had been knocking about  little drab towns  crawling across  wintry country  dirty smokingcars     blamed if when  chanced upon  fine human creature  suddenly wished himself more   man while  little drummer  drinking  recover his nerve alexandra hurried   drug store   most likely place  find carl linstrum there  was turning over  portfolio  chromo “studies” which  druggist sold   hanover women who did chinapainting alexandra explained her predicament   boy followed her   corner where emil still sat   pole “i’ll have  go up after her alexandra i think   depot they have some spikes i can strap  my feet wait  minute” carl thrust his hands into his pockets lowered his head  darted up  street against  north wind he   tall boy  fifteen slight  narrowchested when  came back   spikes alexandra asked him what  had done  his overcoat “i left    drug store i couldn’t climb  it anyhow catch me if i fall emil”  called back   began his ascent alexandra watched him anxiously  cold  bitter enough   ground the kitten would not budge  inch carl had  go   very top   pole  then had some difficulty  tearing her  her hold when  reached  ground  handed  cat  her tearful little master “now go into  store  her emil  get warm” he opened  door   child “wait  minute alexandra why can’t i drive  you  far  our place it’s getting colder every minute have you seen  doctor” “yes he  coming over tomorrow but  says father can’t get better can’t get well” the girl’s lip trembled she looked fixedly up  bleak street  if she  gathering her strength  face something  if she  trying  all her might  grasp  situation which no matter how painful must  met  dealt  somehow the wind flapped  skirts  her heavy coat about her carl did not say anything but she felt his sympathy he too  lonely he   thin frail boy  brooding dark eyes very quiet  all his movements there   delicate pallor  his thin face  his mouth  too sensitive   boy’s the lips had already  little curl  bitterness  skepticism the two friends stood   few moments   windy street corner not speaking  word  two travelers who have lost their way sometimes stand  admit their perplexity  silence when carl turned away  said “i’ll see  your team” alexandra went into  store  have her purchases packed   eggboxes   get warm before she set out  her long cold drive when she looked  emil she found him sitting   step   staircase  led up   clothing  carpet department he  playing   little bohemian girl marie tovesky who  tying her handkerchief over  kitten’s head   bonnet marie   stranger   country having come  omaha  her mother  visit her uncle joe tovesky she   dark child  brown curly hair like  brunette doll’s  coaxing little red mouth  round yellowbrown eyes every one noticed her eyes  brown iris had golden glints  made them look like goldstone or  softer lights like  colorado mineral called tigereye the country children thereabouts wore their dresses  their shoetops but this city child  dressed  what  then called  “kate greenaway” manner  her red cashmere frock gathered full   yoke came almost   floor this  her poke bonnet gave her  look   quaint little woman she had  white fur tippet about her neck  made no fussy objections when emil fingered  admiringly alexandra had not  heart  take him away  so pretty  playfellow  she let them tease  kitten together until joe tovesky came  noisily  picked up his little niece setting her  his shoulder  every one  see his children  all boys   adored this little creature his cronies formed  circle about him admiring  teasing  little girl who took their jokes  great good nature they  all delighted  her  they seldom saw so pretty  carefully nurtured  child they told her  she must choose one  them   sweetheart  each began pressing his suit  offering her bribes candy  little pigs  spotted calves she looked archly into  big brown mustached faces smelling  spirits  tobacco then she ran her tiny forefinger delicately over joe’s bristly chin  said “here  my sweetheart” the bohemians roared  laughter  marie’s uncle hugged her until she cried “please don’t uncle joe you hurt me” each  joe’s friends gave her  bag  candy  she kissed them all around though she did not like country candy very well perhaps   why she bethought herself  emil “let me down uncle joe” she said “i want  give some  my candy   nice little boy i found” she walked graciously over  emil followed  her lusty admirers who formed  new circle  teased  little boy until  hid his face  his sister’s skirts  she had  scold him  being such  baby the farm people  making preparations  start  home the women  checking over their groceries  pinning their big red shawls about their heads the men  buying tobacco  candy  what money they had left  showing each other new boots  gloves  blue flannel shirts three big bohemians  drinking raw alcohol tinctured  oil  cinnamon this  said  fortify one effectually against  cold  they smacked their lips after each pull   flask their volubility drowned every other noise   place   overheated store sounded  their spirited language   reeked  pipe smoke damp woolens  kerosene carl came in wearing his overcoat  carrying  wooden box   brass handle “come”  said “i’ve fed  watered your team   wagon  ready” he carried emil out  tucked him down   straw   wagonbox the heat had made  little boy sleepy but  still clung  his kitten “you  awful good  climb so high  get my kitten carl when i get big i’ll climb  get little boys’ kittens  them”  murmured drowsily before  horses  over  first hill emil  his cat  both fast asleep although   only four o’clock  winter day  fading the road led southwest toward  streak  pale watery light  glimmered   leaden sky the light fell upon  two sad young faces   turned mutely toward it upon  eyes   girl who seemed   looking  such anguished perplexity into  future upon  sombre eyes   boy who seemed already   looking into  past the little town behind them had vanished  if  had never been had fallen behind  swell   prairie   stern frozen country received them into  bosom the homesteads  few  far apart here  there  windmill gaunt against  sky  sod house crouching   hollow but  great fact   land itself which seemed  overwhelm  little beginnings  human society  struggled   sombre wastes it   facing this vast hardness   boy’s mouth had become so bitter because  felt  men  too weak  make any mark here   land wanted   let alone  preserve  own fierce strength  peculiar savage kind  beauty  uninterrupted mournfulness the wagon jolted along over  frozen road the two friends had less  say  each other than usual  if  cold had somehow penetrated  their hearts “did lou  oscar go   blue  cut wood today” carl asked “yes i’m almost sorry i let them go it’s turned so cold but mother frets if  wood gets low” she stopped  put her hand  her forehead brushing back her hair “i don’t know what   become  us carl if father   die i don’t dare  think about it i wish we could all go  him  let  grass grow back over everything” carl made no reply just ahead  them   norwegian graveyard where  grass had indeed grown back over everything shaggy  red hiding even  wire fence carl realized    not  very helpful companion but there  nothing  could say “of course” alexandra went on steadying her voice  little “the boys  strong  work hard but we’ve always depended so  father  i don’t see how we can go ahead i almost feel  if there  nothing  go ahead for” “does your father know” “yes i think  does he lies  counts  his fingers all day i think   trying  count up what   leaving  us it’s  comfort  him  my chickens  laying right  through  cold weather  bringing   little money i wish we could keep his mind off such things but i don’t have much time    him now” “i wonder if he’d like  have me bring my magic lantern over some evening” alexandra turned her face toward him “oh carl have you got it” “yes it’s back there   straw didn’t you notice  box i  carrying i tried  all morning   drugstore cellar   worked ever so well makes fine big pictures” “what  they about” “oh hunting pictures  germany  robinson crusoe  funny pictures about cannibals i’m going  paint some slides    glass out   hans andersen book” alexandra seemed actually cheered there  often  good deal   child left  people who have had  grow up too soon “do bring  over carl i can hardly wait  see it  i’m sure   please father are  pictures colored then i know he’ll like them he likes  calendars i get him  town i wish i could get more you must leave me here mustn’t you it’s been nice  have company” carl stopped  horses  looked dubiously up   black sky “it’s pretty dark of course  horses  take you home but i think i’d better light your lantern  case you should need it” he gave her  reins  climbed back into  wagonbox where  crouched down  made  tent  his overcoat after  dozen trials  succeeded  lighting  lantern which  placed  front  alexandra half covering    blanket so   light would not shine  her eyes “now wait until i find my box yes here  is goodnight alexandra try not  worry” carl sprang   ground  ran off across  fields toward  linstrum homestead “hoo hooooo”  called back   disappeared over  ridge  dropped into  sand gully the wind answered him like  echo “hoo hooooooo” alexandra drove off alone the rattle  her wagon  lost   howling   wind but her lantern held firmly between her feet made  moving point  light along  highway going deeper  deeper into  dark country ii on one   ridges   wintry waste stood  low log house  which john bergson

enigma it  like  horse  no one knows how  break  harness  runs wild  kicks things  pieces he had  idea  no one understood how  farm  properly  this  often discussed  alexandra their neighbors certainly knew even less about farming than  did many  them had never worked   farm until they took up their homesteads they had been handwerkers  home tailors locksmiths joiners cigarmakers etc bergson himself had worked   shipyard for weeks john bergson had been thinking about these things his bed stood   sittingroom next   kitchen through  day while  baking  washing  ironing  going on

sons but   not  question  choice as  lay there day after day  had  accept  situation   was    thankful  there  one among his children  whom  could entrust  future  his family   possibilities  his hardwon land the winter twilight  fading the sick man heard his wife strike  match   kitchen   light   lamp glimmered through  cracks   door it seemed like  light shining far away he turned painfully  his bed  looked  his white hands  all  work gone out  them he  ready  give up  felt he did not know how  had come about but   quite willing  go deep under his fields  rest where  plow could not find him he  tired  making mistakes he  content  leave  tangle  other hands  thought  his alexandra’s strong ones “dotter”  called feebly “dotter” he heard her quick step  saw her tall figure appear

heavy feet   kitchen alexandra went   door  beckoned  her brothers two strapping boys  seventeen  nineteen they came   stood   foot   bed their father looked  them searchingly though   too dark  see their faces they  just  same boys  told himself  had not been mistaken  them the square head  heavy shoulders belonged  oscar  elder the younger boy  quicker but vacillating “boys” said  father wearily “i want you  keep  land together    guided  your sister i have talked  her since i have been sick  she knows all my wishes i want no quarrels among my children  so long  there  one house there

according   courts but   next few years you  have  hard  you must all keep together alexandra  manage  best she can” oscar who  usually  last  speak replied because    older “yes father it would  so anyway without your speaking we  all work  place together” “and you   guided  your sister boys   good brothers  her  good sons  your mother that  good and alexandra must not work   fields any more there  no necessity now hire  man when you need help she can make much more  her eggs  butter than  wages   man it  one  my mistakes  i did not find  out sooner try  break  little more land every year sod corn  good  fodder keep turning  land  always put up more hay than you need don’t grudge your mother  little time  plowing her garden  setting out fruit trees even if  comes   busy season she  been  good mother  you  she  always missed  old country” when they went back   kitchen  boys sat down silently   table throughout  meal they looked down  their plates  did not lift their red eyes they did not eat much although they had been working   cold all day  there   rabbit stewed  gravy  supper  prune pies john bergson had married beneath him but  had married  good housewife mrs bergson   fairskinned corpulent woman heavy  placid like her son oscar but there  something comfortable about her perhaps   her own love  comfort for eleven years she had worthily striven  maintain some semblance  household order amid conditions  made order very difficult habit  very strong  mrs bergson  her unremitting efforts  repeat  routine  her old life among new surroundings had done  great deal  keep  family  disintegrating morally  getting careless  their ways the bergsons had  log house  instance only because mrs bergson would not live   sod house she missed  fish diet  her own country  twice every summer she sent  boys   river twenty miles   southward  fish  channel cat when  children  little she used  load them all into  wagon  baby   crib  go fishing herself alexandra

doorway   linstrum kitchen dreaming over  illustrated paper when  heard  rattle   wagon along  hill road looking up  recognized  bergsons’ team  two seats   wagon which meant they  off   pleasure excursion oscar  lou   front seat wore their cloth hats  coats never worn except  sundays  emil   second seat  alexandra sat proudly  his new trousers made   pair  his father’s   pinkstriped shirt   wide ruffled collar oscar stopped  horses  waved  carl who caught up his hat  ran through  melon patch  join them “want  go  us” lou called “we’re going  crazy ivar’s  buy  hammock” “sure” carl ran up panting  clambering over  wheel sat down beside emil “i’ve always wanted  see ivar’s pond they say it’s  biggest  all  country aren’t you afraid  go  ivar’s   new shirt emil he might want   take  right off your back” emil grinned “i’d  awful scared  go”  admitted “if you big boys weren’t along  take care  me did you ever hear him howl carl people say sometimes  runs about  country howling  night because   afraid  lord  destroy him mother thinks  must have done something awful wicked” lou looked back  winked  carl “what would you do emil if you  out   prairie  yourself  seen him coming” emil stared “maybe i could hide   badgerhole”  suggested doubtfully “but suppose there wasn’t any badgerhole” lou persisted “would you run” “no i’d  too scared  run” emil admitted mournfully twisting his fingers “i guess i’d sit right down   ground  say my prayers” the big boys laughed  oscar brandished his whip over  broad backs   horses “he wouldn’t hurt you emil” said carl persuasively “he came  doctor our mare when she ate green corn  swelled up most  big   watertank he petted her just like you do your cats i couldn’t understand much  said   don’t talk any english but  kept patting her  groaning  if  had  pain himself  saying ‘there now sister that’s easier that’s better’” lou  oscar laughed  emil giggled delightedly  looked up  his sister “i don’t think  knows anything  all about doctoring” said oscar scornfully “they say when horses have distemper  takes  medicine himself  then prays over  horses” alexandra spoke up “that’s what  crows said but  cured their horses all  same some days his mind  cloudy like but if you can get him   clear day you can learn  great deal  him he understands animals didn’t i see him take  horn off  berquist’s cow when she had torn  loose  went crazy she  tearing all over  place knocking herself against things and  last she ran out   roof   old dugout  her legs went through  there she stuck bellowing ivar came running  his white bag   moment  got  her she  quiet  let him saw her horn off  daub  place  tar” emil had been watching his sister his face reflecting  sufferings   cow “and then didn’t  hurt her any more”  asked alexandra patted him “no not any more and  two days they could use her milk again” the road  ivar’s homestead   very poor one he had settled   rough country across  county line where no one lived but some russians—half  dozen families who dwelt together  one long house divided off like barracks ivar had explained his choice  saying   fewer neighbors  had  fewer temptations nevertheless when one considered  his chief business  horsedoctoring  seemed rather shortsighted  him  live   most inaccessible place  could find the bergson wagon lurched along over  rough hummocks  grass banks followed  bottom  winding draws or skirted  margin  wide lagoons where  golden coreopsis grew up out   clear water   wild ducks rose   whirr  wings lou looked after them helplessly “i wish i’d brought my gun anyway alexandra”  said fretfully “i could have hidden  under  straw   bottom   wagon” “then we’d have had  lie  ivar besides they say  can smell dead birds and if  knew we wouldn’t get anything out  him not even  hammock i want  talk  him   won’t talk sense if he’s angry it makes him foolish” lou sniffed “whoever heard  him talking sense anyhow i’d rather have ducks  supper than crazy ivar’s tongue” emil  alarmed “oh but lou you don’t want  make him mad he might howl” they all laughed again  oscar urged  horses up  crumbling side   clay bank they had left  lagoons   red grass behind them in crazy ivar’s country  grass  short  gray  draws deeper than they    bergsons’ neighborhood   land  all broken up into hillocks  clay ridges the wild flowers disappeared  only   bottom   draws  gullies grew  few   very toughest  hardiest shoestring  ironweed  snowonthemountain “look look emil there’s ivar’s big pond” alexandra pointed   shining sheet  water  lay   bottom   shallow draw at one end   pond   earthen dam planted  green willow bushes  above   door   single window  set into  hillside you would not have seen them  all but   reflection   sunlight upon  four panes  windowglass and   all you saw not  shed not  corral not  well not even  path broken   curly grass but   piece  rusty stovepipe sticking up through  sod you could have walked over  roof  ivar’s dwelling without dreaming  you  near  human habitation ivar had lived  three years   clay bank without defiling  face  nature any more than  coyote  had lived there before him had done when  bergsons drove over  hill ivar  sitting   doorway  his house reading  norwegian bible he   queerly shaped old man   thick powerful body set  short bowlegs his shaggy white hair falling   thick mane about his ruddy cheeks made him look older than  was he  barefoot but  wore  clean shirt  unbleached cotton open   neck he always put   clean shirt when sunday morning came round though  never went  church he had  peculiar religion  his own  could not get   any   denominations often  did not see anybody  one week’s end  another he kept  calendar  every morning  checked off  day so    never  any doubt   which day   week  was ivar hired himself out  threshing  cornhusking time   doctored sick animals when   sent for when    home  made hammocks out  twine  committed chapters   bible  memory ivar found contentment   solitude  had sought out  himself he disliked  litter  human dwellings  broken food  bits  broken china  old washboilers  teakettles thrown into  sunflower patch he preferred  cleanness  tidiness   wild sod he always said   badgers had cleaner houses than people   when  took  housekeeper her name would  mrs badger he best expressed his preference  his wild homestead  saying  his bible seemed truer  him there if one stood   doorway  his cave  looked off   rough land  smiling sky  curly grass white   hot sunlight if one listened   rapturous song   lark  drumming   quail  burr   locust against  vast silence one understood what ivar meant on this sunday afternoon his face shone  happiness he closed  book  his knee keeping  place  his horny finger  repeated softly— he sendeth  springs into  valleys which run among  hills they give drink  every beast   field  wild asses quench their thirst the trees   lord  full  sap  cedars  lebanon which  hath planted where  birds make their nests    stork  fir trees  her house the high hills   refuge   wild goats   rocks   conies before  opened his bible again ivar heard  bergsons’ wagon approaching   sprang up  ran toward it “no guns no guns”  shouted waving his arms distractedly “no ivar no guns” alexandra called reassuringly he dropped his arms  went up   wagon smiling amiably  looking  them out  his pale blue eyes “we want  buy  hammock if you have one” alexandra explained “and my little brother here wants  see your big pond where so many birds come” ivar smiled foolishly  began rubbing  horses’ noses  feeling about their mouths behind  bits “not many birds just now a few ducks this morning  some snipe come  drink but there   crane last week she spent one night  came back  next evening i don’t know why it  not her season  course many  them go over   fall then  pond  full  strange voices every night” alexandra translated  carl who looked thoughtful “ask him alexandra if   true   sea gull came here once i have heard so” she had some difficulty  making  old man understand he looked puzzled  first then smote his hands together   remembered “oh yes yes a big white bird  long wings  pink feet my what  voice she had she came   afternoon  kept flying about  pond  screaming until dark she   trouble  some sort but i could not understand her she  going over   other ocean maybe  did not know how far  was she  afraid  never getting there she  more mournful than our birds here she cried   night she saw  light  my window  darted up  it maybe she thought my house   boat she  such  wild thing next morning when  sun rose i went out  take her food but she flew up into  sky  went  her way” ivar ran his fingers through his thick hair “i have many strange birds stop  me here they come  very far away   great company i hope you boys never shoot wild birds” lou  oscar grinned  ivar shook his bushy head “yes i know boys  thoughtless but these wild things  god’s birds he watches over them  counts them  we do our cattle christ says so   new testament” “now ivar” lou asked “may we water our horses  your pond  give them some feed it’s  bad road  your place” “yes yes  is” the old man scrambled about  began  loose  tugs “a bad road eh girls and  bay   colt  home” oscar brushed  old man aside “we’ll take care   horses ivar you’ll  finding some disease  them alexandra wants  see your hammocks” ivar led alexandra  emil  his little cave house he had but one room neatly plastered  whitewashed  there   wooden floor there   kitchen stove  table covered  oilcloth two chairs  clock  calendar  few books   windowshelf nothing more but  place   clean   cupboard “but where do you sleep ivar” emil asked looking about ivar unslung  hammock   hook   wall    rolled  buffalo robe “there my son a hammock   good bed   winter i wrap up  this skin where i go  work  beds  not half so easy  this” by this time emil had lost all his timidity he thought  cave  very superior kind  house there  something pleasantly unusual about   about ivar “do  birds know you   kind  them ivar is  why so many come”  asked ivar sat down   floor  tucked his feet under him “see little brother they have come   long way  they  very tired from up there where they  flying our country looks dark  flat they must have water  drink   bathe  before they can go   their journey they look this way  that  far below them they see something shining like  piece  glass set   dark earth that  my pond they come     not disturbed maybe i sprinkle  little corn they tell  other birds  next year more come this way they have their roads up there  we have down here” emil rubbed his knees thoughtfully “and   true ivar about  head ducks falling back when they  tired   hind ones taking their place” “yes the point   wedge gets  worst  it they cut  wind they can only stand  there  little while—half  hour maybe then they fall back   wedge splits  little while  rear ones come up  middle   front then  closes up  they fly on   new edge they  always changing like that up   air never any confusion just like soldiers who have been drilled” alexandra had selected her hammock   time  boys came up   pond they would not come in but sat   shade   bank outside while alexandra  ivar talked about  birds  about his housekeeping  why  never ate meat fresh or salt alexandra  sitting  one   wooden chairs her arms resting   table ivar  sitting   floor  her feet “ivar” she said suddenly beginning  trace  pattern   oilcloth  her forefinger “i came today more because i wanted  talk  you than because i wanted  buy  hammock” “yes” the old man scraped his bare feet   plank floor “we have  big bunch  hogs ivar i wouldn’t sell   spring when everybody advised me to  now so many people  losing their hogs  i am frightened what can  done” ivar’s little eyes began  shine they lost their vagueness “you feed them swill  such stuff of course and sour milk oh yes and keep them   stinking pen i tell you sister  hogs  this country  put upon they become unclean like  hogs   bible if you kept your chickens like that what would happen you have  little sorghum patch maybe put  fence around it  turn  hogs in build  shed  give them shade  thatch  poles let  boys haul water  them  barrels clean water  plenty get them off  old stinking ground  do not let them go back there until winter give them only grain  clean feed such  you would give horses or cattle hogs do not like   filthy” the boys outside  door had been listening lou nudged his brother “come  horses  done eating let’s hitch up  get out  here he’ll fill her full  notions she’ll   having  pigs sleep  us next” oscar grunted  got up carl who could not understand what ivar said saw   two boys  displeased they did not mind hard work but they hated experiments  could never see  use  taking pains even lou who  more elastic than his older brother disliked  do anything different  their neighbors he felt   made them conspicuous  gave people  chance  talk about them once they    homeward road  boys forgot their illhumor  joked about ivar  his birds alexandra did not propose any reforms   care   pigs  they hoped she had forgotten ivar’s talk they agreed    crazier than ever  would never  able  prove up  his land because  worked  so little alexandra privately resolved  she would have  talk  ivar about this  stir him up the boys persuaded carl  stay  supper  go swimming   pasture pond after dark that evening after she had washed  supper dishes alexandra sat down   kitchen doorstep while her mother  mixing  bread it   still deepbreathing summer night full   smell   hay fields sounds  laughter  splashing came up   pasture  when  moon rose rapidly above  bare rim   prairie  pond glittered like polished metal  she could see  flash  white bodies   boys ran about  edge or jumped into  water alexandra watched  shimmering pool dreamily but eventually her eyes went back   sorghum patch south   barn where she  planning  make her new pig corral iv for  first three years after john bergson’s death  affairs  his family prospered then came  hard times  brought every one   divide   brink  despair three years  drouth  failure  last struggle   wild soil against  encroaching plowshare the first  these fruitless summers  bergson boys bore courageously the failure   corn crop made labor cheap lou  oscar hired two men  put  bigger crops than ever before they lost everything they spent the whole country  discouraged farmers who  already  debt had  give up their land a few foreclosures demoralized  county the settlers sat about   wooden sidewalks   little town  told each other   country  never meant  men  live in  thing  do   get back  iowa  illinois  any place  had been proved habitable the bergson boys certainly would have been happier  their uncle otto   bakery shop  chicago like most  their neighbors they  meant  follow  paths already marked out  them not  break trails   new country a steady job  few holidays nothing  think about  they would have been very happy it  no fault  theirs  they had been dragged into  wilderness when they  little boys a pioneer should have imagination should  able  enjoy  idea  things more than  things themselves the second  these barren summers  passing one september afternoon alexandra had gone over   garden across  draw  dig sweet potatoes—they had been thriving upon  weather   fatal  everything else but when carl linstrum came up  garden rows  find her she  not working she  standing lost  thought leaning upon her pitchfork her sunbonnet lying beside her   ground the dry garden patch smelled  drying vines   strewn  yellow seedcucumbers  pumpkins  citrons at one end next  rhubarb grew feathery asparagus  red berries down  middle   garden   row  gooseberry  currant bushes a few tough zenias  marigolds   row  scarlet sage bore witness   buckets  water  mrs bergson had carried there after sundown against  prohibition  her sons carl came quietly  slowly up  garden path looking intently  alexandra she did not hear him she  standing perfectly still   serious ease so characteristic  her her thick reddish braids twisted about her head fairly burned   sunlight the air  cool enough  make  warm sun pleasant  one’s back  shoulders  so clear   eye could follow  hawk up  up into  blazing blue depths   sky even carl never  very cheerful boy  considerably darkened  these last two bitter years loved  country  days like this felt something strong  young  wild come out  it  laughed  care “alexandra”  said   approached her “i want  talk  you let’s sit down   gooseberry bushes” he picked up her sack  potatoes  they crossed  garden “boys gone  town”  asked   sank down   warm sunbaked earth “well we have made up our minds  last alexandra we  really going away” she looked  him  if she   little frightened “really carl is  settled” “yes father  heard  st louis  they  give him back his old job   cigar factory he must  there   first  november they  taking  new men then we  sell  place  whatever we can get  auction  stock we haven’t enough  ship i am going  learn engraving   german engraver there  then try  get work  chicago” alexandra’s hands dropped  her lap her eyes became dreamy  filled  tears carl’s sensitive lower lip trembled he scratched   soft earth beside him   stick “that’s all i hate about it alexandra”  said slowly “you’ve stood  us through so much  helped father out so many times  now  seems  if we  running off  leaving you  face  worst  it but  isn’t  if we could really ever   any help  you we  only one more drag one more thing you look out   feel responsible for father  never meant   farmer you know that and i hate it we’d only get  deeper  deeper” “yes yes carl i know you  wasting your life here you  able  do much better things you  nearly nineteen now  i wouldn’t have you stay i’ve always hoped you would get away but i can’t help feeling scared when i think how i  miss you—more than you  ever know” she brushed  tears  her cheeks not trying  hide them “but alexandra”  said sadly  wistfully “i’ve never been any real help  you beyond sometimes trying  keep  boys   good humor” alexandra smiled  shook her head “oh it’s not that nothing like that it’s  understanding me   boys  mother  you’ve helped me i expect    only way one person ever really can help another i think you  about  only one  ever helped me somehow   take more courage  bear your going than everything   happened before” carl looked   ground “you see we’ve all depended so  you”  said “even father he makes me laugh when anything comes up  always says ‘i wonder what  bergsons  going  do about that i guess i’ll go  ask her’ i’ll never forget  time when we first came here  our horse had  colic  i ran over  your place—your father  away  you came home  me  showed father how  let  wind out   horse you  only  little girl then but you knew ever so much more about farm work than poor father you remember how homesick i used  get  what long talks we used  have coming  school we’ve someway always felt alike about things” “yes that’s it we’ve liked  same things  we’ve liked them together without anybody else knowing and we’ve had good times hunting  christmas trees  going  ducks  making our plum wine together every year we’ve never either  us had any other close friend and now—” alexandra wiped her eyes   corner  her apron “and now i must remember  you  going where you  have many friends   find  work you  meant  do but you’ll write  me carl that  mean  great deal  me here” “i’ll write  long  i live” cried  boy impetuously “and i’ll  working  you  much   myself alexandra i want  do something you’ll like   proud of i’m  fool here but i know i can do something” he sat up  frowned   red grass alexandra sighed “how discouraged  boys   when they hear they always come home  town discouraged anyway so many people  trying  leave  country  they talk  our boys  make them lowspirited i’m afraid they  beginning  feel hard toward me because i won’t listen  any talk about going sometimes i feel like i’m getting tired  standing up  this country” “i won’t tell  boys yet if you’d rather not” “oh i’ll tell them myself tonight when they come home they’ll  talking wild anyway  no good comes  keeping bad news it’s all harder  them than    me lou wants  get married poor boy   can’t until times  better see there goes  sun carl i must  getting back mother  want her potatoes it’s chilly already  moment  light goes” alexandra rose  looked about a golden afterglow throbbed   west but  country already looked empty  mournful a dark moving mass came over  western hill  lee boy  bringing   herd   other halfsection emil ran   windmill  open  corral gate from  log house   little rise across  draw  smoke  curling the cattle lowed  bellowed in  sky  pale halfmoon  slowly silvering alexandra  carl walked together down  potato rows “i have  keep telling myself what  going  happen” she said softly “since you have been here ten years now i have never really been lonely but i can remember what   like before now i shall have nobody but emil but   my boy    tenderhearted” that night when  boys  called  supper they sat down moodily they had worn their coats  town but they ate  their striped shirts  suspenders they  grown men now and  alexandra said   last few years they had been growing more  more like themselves lou  still  slighter   two  quicker  more intelligent but apt  go off  halfcock he had  lively blue eye  thin fair skin always burned red   neckband  his shirt  summer stiff yellow hair  would not lie down  his head   bristly little yellow mustache  which   very proud oscar could not grow  mustache his pale face   bare   egg  his white eyebrows gave   empty look he   man  powerful body  unusual endurance  sort  man you could attach   cornsheller  you would  engine he would turn  all day without hurrying without slowing down but    indolent  mind    unsparing  his body his love  routine amounted   vice he worked like  insect always doing  same thing over   same way regardless  whether   best or no he felt  there   sovereign virtue  mere bodily toil   rather liked  do things   hardest way if  field had once been  corn  couldn’t bear  put  into wheat he liked  begin his cornplanting   same time every year whether  season  backward or forward he seemed  feel   his own irreproachable regularity  would clear himself  blame  reprove  weather when  wheat crop failed  threshed  straw   dead loss  demonstrate how little grain there was  thus prove his case against providence lou   other hand  fussy  flighty always planned  get through two days’ work  one  often got only  least important things done he liked  keep  place up but  never got round  doing odd jobs until  had  neglect more pressing work  attend  them in  middle   wheat harvest when  grain  overripe  every hand  needed  would stop  mend fences or  patch  harness then dash down   field  overwork   laid up  bed   week the two boys balanced each other  they pulled well together they had been good friends since they  children one seldom went anywhere even  town without  other tonight after they sat down  supper oscar kept looking  lou  if  expected him  say something  lou blinked his eyes  frowned  his plate it  alexandra herself who  last opened  discussion “the linstrums” she said calmly  she put another plate  hot biscuit   table “are going back  st louis the old man  going  work   cigar factory again” at this lou plunged in “you see alexandra everybody who can crawl out  going away there’s no use  us trying  stick  out just   stubborn there’s something  knowing when  quit” “where do you want  go lou” “any place where things  grow” said oscar grimly lou reached   potato “chris arnson  traded his halfsection   place down   river” “who did  trade with” “charley fuller  town” “fuller  real estate man you see lou  fuller   head  him he’s buying  trading  every bit  land  can get up here it’ll make him  rich man some day” “he’s rich now that’s why  can take  chance” “why can’t we we’ll live longer than  will some day  land itself   worth more than all we can ever raise  it” lou laughed “it could  worth that  still not  worth much why alexandra you don’t know what you’re talking about our place wouldn’t bring now what  would six years ago the fellows  settled up here just made  mistake now they’re beginning  see this high land wasn’t never meant  grow nothing on  everybody who ain’t fixed  graze cattle  trying  crawl out it’s too high  farm up here all  americans  skinning out that man percy adams north  town told me    going  let fuller take his land  stuff  four hundred dollars   ticket  chicago” “there’s fuller again” alexandra exclaimed “i wish  man would take me   partner he’s feathering his nest if only poor people could learn  little  rich people but all these fellows who  running off  bad farmers like poor mr linstrum they couldn’t get ahead even  good years  they all got into debt while father  getting out i think we ought  hold   long  we can  father’s account he  so set  keeping this land he must have seen harder times than this here how     early days mother” mrs bergson  weeping quietly these family discussions always depressed her  made her remember all  she had been torn away from “i don’t see why  boys  always taking  about going away” she said wiping her eyes “i don’t want  move again out  some raw place maybe where we’d  worse off than we  here  all  do over again i won’t move if  rest  you go i  ask some   neighbors  take me in  stay   buried  father i’m not going  leave him  himself   prairie  cattle  run over” she began  cry more bitterly the boys looked angry alexandra put  soothing hand  her mother’s shoulder “there’s no question  that mother you don’t have  go if you don’t want to a third   place belongs  you  american law  we can’t sell without your consent we only want you  advise us how did  use   when you  father first came was  really  bad  this or not” “oh worse much worse” moaned mrs bergson “drouth chincebugs hail everything my garden all cut  pieces like sauerkraut no grapes   creek no nothing the people all lived just like coyotes” oscar got up  tramped out   kitchen lou followed him they felt  alexandra had taken  unfair advantage  turning their mother loose  them the next morning they  silent  reserved they did not offer  take  women  church but went down   barn immediately after breakfast  stayed there all day when carl linstrum came over   afternoon alexandra winked  him  pointed toward  barn he understood her  went down  play cards   boys they believed   very wicked thing  do  sunday   relieved their feelings alexandra stayed   house on sunday afternoon mrs bergson always took  nap  alexandra read during  week she read only  newspaper but  sunday    long evenings  winter she read  good deal read  few things over  great many times she knew long portions   “frithjof saga”  heart and like most swedes who read  all she  fond  longfellow’s verse—the ballads   “golden legend”  “the spanish student” today she sat   wooden rockingchair   swedish bible open  her knees but she  not reading she  looking thoughtfully away   point where  upland road disappeared over  rim   prairie her body    attitude  perfect repose such    apt  take when she  thinking earnestly her mind  slow truthful steadfast she had not  least spark  cleverness all afternoon  sittingroom  full  quiet  sunlight emil  making rabbit traps   kitchen shed the hens  clucking  scratching brown holes   flower beds   wind  teasing  prince’s feather   door that evening carl came    boys  supper “emil” said alexandra when they  all seated   table “how would you like  go traveling because i am going  take  trip  you can go  me if you want to” the boys looked up  amazement they  always afraid  alexandra’s schemes carl  interested “i’ve been thinking boys” she went on “that maybe i am too set against making  change i’m going  take brigham   buckboard tomorrow  drive down   river country  spend  few days looking over what they’ve got down there if i find anything good you boys can go down  make  trade” “nobody down there  trade  anything up here” said oscar gloomily “that’s just what i want  find out maybe they  just  discontented down there  we  up here things away  home often look better than they are you know what your hans andersen book says carl about  swedes liking  buy danish bread   danes liking  buy swedish bread because people always think  bread  another country  better than their own anyway i’ve heard so much about  river farms i won’t  satisfied till i’ve seen  myself” lou fidgeted “look out don’t agree  anything don’t let them fool you” lou  apt   fooled himself he had not yet learned  keep away   shellgame wagons  followed  circus after supper lou put   necktie  went across  fields  court annie lee  carl  oscar sat down   game  checkers while alexandra read “the swiss family robinson” aloud  her mother  emil it  not long before  two boys   table neglected their game  listen they  all big children together  they found  adventures   family   tree house so absorbing  they gave them their undivided attention v alexandra  emil spent five days down among  river farms driving up  down  valley alexandra talked   men about their crops    women about their poultry she spent  whole day  one young farmer who had been away  school  who  experimenting   new kind  clover hay she learned  great deal as they drove along she  emil talked  planned at last   sixth day alexandra turned brigham’s head northward  left  river behind “there’s nothing    us down there emil there   few fine farms but they  owned   rich men  town  couldn’t  bought most   land  rough  hilly they can always scrape along down there but they can never do anything big down there they have  little certainty but up  us there   big chance we must have faith   high land emil i want  hold  harder than ever  when you’re  man you’ll thank me” she urged brigham forward when  road began  climb  first long swells   divide alexandra hummed  old swedish hymn  emil wondered why his sister looked so happy her face  so radiant   felt shy about asking her for  first time perhaps since  land emerged   waters  geologic ages  human face  set toward   love  yearning it seemed beautiful  her rich  strong  glorious her eyes drank   breadth  it until her tears blinded her then  genius   divide  great free spirit which breathes across it must have bent lower than  ever bent   human  before the history  every country begins   heart   man or  woman alexandra reached home   afternoon that evening she held  family council  told her brothers all  she had seen  heard “i want you boys  go down yourselves  look  over nothing  convince you like seeing  your own eyes the river land  settled before this  so they   few years ahead  us  have learned more about farming the land sells  three times  much  this but  five years we  double it the rich men down there own all  best land  they  buying all they can get the thing  do   sell our cattle  what little old corn we have  buy  linstrum place then  next thing  do   take out two loans  our halfsections  buy peter crow’s place raise every dollar we can  buy every acre we can” “mortgage  homestead again” lou cried he sprang up  began  wind  clock furiously “i won’t slave  pay off another mortgage i’ll never do it you’d just  soon kill us all alexandra  carry out some scheme” oscar rubbed his high pale forehead “how do you propose  pay off your mortgages” alexandra looked  one   other  bit her lip they had never seen her so nervous “see here” she brought out  last “we borrow  money  six years well   money we buy  halfsection  linstrum   half  crow   quarter  struble maybe that  give us upwards  fourteen hundred acres won’t it you won’t have  pay off your mortgages  six years by  time any  this land   worth thirty dollars  acre—it   worth fifty but we’ll say thirty then you can sell  garden patch anywhere  pay off  debt  sixteen hundred dollars it’s not  principal i’m worried about it’s  interest  taxes we’ll have  strain  meet  payments but  sure  we  sitting here tonight we can sit down here ten years  now independent landowners not struggling farmers any longer the chance  father  always looking   come” lou  pacing  floor “but how do you know  land  going  go up enough  pay  mortgages and—” “and make us rich besides” alexandra put  firmly “i can’t explain that lou you’ll have  take my word  it i know that’s all when you drive about over  country you can feel  coming” oscar had been sitting  his head lowered his hands hanging between his knees “but we can’t work so much land”  said dully  if   talking  himself “we can’t even try it would just lie there  we’d work ourselves  death” he sighed  laid his calloused fist   table alexandra’s eyes filled  tears she put her hand  his shoulder “you poor boy you won’t have  work it the men  town who  buying up other people’s land don’t try  farm it they   men  watch   new country let’s try  do like  shrewd ones  not like these stupid fellows i don’t want you boys always  have  work like this i want you   independent  emil  go  school” lou held his head  if   splitting “everybody  say we  crazy it must  crazy or everybody would  doing it” “if they were we wouldn’t have much chance no lou i  talking about    smart young man who  raising  new kind  clover he says  right thing  usually just what everybody don’t do why  we better fixed than any  our neighbors because father had more brains our people  better people than these   old country we ought  do more than they do  see further ahead yes mother i’m going  clear  table now” alexandra rose the boys went   stable  see   stock  they  gone  long while when they came back lou played  his dragharmonika  oscar sat figuring  his father’s secretary all evening they said nothing more about alexandra’s project but she felt sure now  they would consent  it just before bedtime oscar went out   pail  water when  did not come back alexandra threw  shawl over her head  ran down  path   windmill she found him sitting there  his head  his hands  she sat down beside him “don’t do anything you don’t want  do oscar” she whispered she waited  moment but  did not stir “i won’t say any more about it if you’d rather not what makes you so discouraged” “i dread signing my name  them pieces  paper”  said slowly “all  time i   boy we had  mortgage hanging over us” “then don’t sign one i don’t want you to if you feel  way” oscar shook his head “no i can see there’s  chance  way i’ve thought  good while there might be we’re  so deep now we might  well go deeper but it’s hard work pulling out  debt like pulling  threshingmachine out   mud breaks your back me  lou’s worked hard  i can’t see it’s got us ahead much” “nobody knows about   well  i do oscar that’s why i want  try  easier way i don’t want you  have  grub  every dollar” “yes i know what you mean maybe it’ll come out right but signing papers  signing papers there ain’t no maybe about that” he took his pail  trudged up  path   house alexandra drew her shawl closer about her  stood leaning against  frame   mill looking   stars which glittered so keenly through  frosty autumn air she always loved  watch them  think  their vastness  distance   their ordered march it fortified her  reflect upon  great operations  nature  when she thought   law  lay behind them she felt  sense  personal security that night she had  new consciousness   country felt almost  new relation  it even her talk   boys had not taken away  feeling  had overwhelmed her when she drove back   divide  afternoon she had never known before how much  country meant  her the chirping

whistling but softly out  respect   quiet folk about him unconscious respect probably   seemed intent upon his own thoughts and like  gladiator’s they  far away he   splendid figure   boy tall  straight   young pine tree   handsome head  stormy gray eyes deeply set under  serious brow the space between his two front teeth which  unusually far apart gave him  proficiency  whistling  which

anywhere who  supple  quick  adapting themselves  circumstances after  final swish emil snapped  gate  sprang into  cart holding his scythe well out over  wheel “there”  sighed “i gave old man lee

twice you must dance  all  french girls it hurts their feelings if you don’t they think you’re proud because you’ve been away  school or something” emil sniffed “how do you know they think that” “well you didn’t dance  them much  raoul marcel’s party  i could tell how they took    way they looked  you—and  me” “all right” said emil shortly studying  glittering blade  his scythe they drove westward toward norway creek  toward  big white house  stood   hill several miles across  fields there  so many sheds  outbuildings grouped about    place looked not unlike  tiny village a stranger approaching it could not help noticing  beauty  fruitfulness   outlying fields there  something individual about  great farm  most unusual trimness  care  detail on either side   road   mile before you reached

uneven  comfort one room  papered carpeted overfurnished  next  almost bare the pleasantest rooms   house   kitchen—where alexandra’s three young swedish girls chatter  cook  pickle  preserve all summer long—and  sittingroom  which alexandra  brought together  old homely furniture   bergsons used  their first log house  family portraits   few things her mother brought  sweden when you go out

home  little past noon  when  went into  kitchen alexandra  already seated   head   long table having dinner  her men  she always did unless there  visitors he slipped into his empty place  his sister’s right the three pretty young swedish girls who did alexandra’s housework  cutting pies refilling coffeecups placing platters  bread  meat  potatoes upon  red tablecloth  continually getting  each other’s way between  table   stove to  sure they always wasted  good deal  time getting  each other’s way  giggling  each other’s mistakes but  alexandra had pointedly told her sistersinlaw    hear them giggle  she kept three young things  her kitchen  work she could do herself if   necessary these girls  their long letters  home their finery  their loveaffairs afforded her  great deal  entertainment  they  company  her when emil  away  school of  youngest girl signa who   pretty figure mottled pink cheeks  yellow hair alexandra  very fond though she keeps  sharp eye upon her signa  apt   skittish  mealtime when  men  about   spill  coffee or upset  cream it  supposed  nelse jensen one   six men   dinnertable  courting signa though   been so careful not  commit himself  no one   house least  all signa can tell just how far  matter  progressed nelse watches her glumly  she waits upon  table    evening  sits   bench behind  stove  his dragharmonika playing mournful airs  watching her  she goes about her work when alexandra asked signa whether she thought nelse   earnest  poor child hid her hands under her apron  murmured “i don’t know ma’m but  scolds me about everything like  if  wanted  have me” at alexandra’s left sat  very old man barefoot  wearing  long blue blouse open   neck his shaggy head  scarcely whiter than   sixteen years ago but his little blue eyes have become pale  watery  his ruddy face  withered like  apple   clung all winter   tree when ivar lost his land through mismanagement  dozen years ago alexandra took him in    been  member  her household ever since he  too old  work   fields but  hitches  unhitches  workteams  looks after  health   stock sometimes   winter evening alexandra calls him into  sittingroom  read  bible aloud  her   still reads very well he dislikes human habitations so alexandra  fitted him up  room   barn where   very comfortable being near  horses and   says further  temptations no one  ever found out what his temptations are in cold weather  sits   kitchen fire  makes hammocks or mends harness until   time  go  bed then  says his prayers  great length behind  stove puts  his buffaloskin coat  goes out  his room   barn alexandra herself  changed very little her figure  fuller  she  more color she seems sunnier  more vigorous than she did   young girl but she still   same calmness  deliberation  manner  same clear eyes  she still wears her hair  two braids wound round her head it  so curly  fiery ends escape   braids  make her head look like one   big double sunflowers  fringe her vegetable garden her face  always tanned  summer  her sunbonnet  oftener  her arm than  her head but where her collar falls away  her neck or where her sleeves  pushed back  her wrist  skin   such smoothness  whiteness  none but swedish women ever possess skin   freshness   snow itself alexandra did not talk much   table but she encouraged her men  talk  she always listened attentively even when they seemed   talking foolishly today barney flinn  big redheaded irishman who had been  alexandra  five years  who  actually her foreman though  had no such title  grumbling about  new silo she had put up  spring it happened    first silo   divide  alexandra’s neighbors  her men  skeptical about it “to  sure if  thing don’t work we’ll have plenty  feed without it indeed” barney conceded nelse jensen signa’s gloomy suitor had his word “lou  says  wouldn’t have no silo  his place if you’d give   him he says  feed outen  gives  stock  bloat he heard  somebody lost four head  horses feedin’ ’em  stuff” alexandra looked down  table  one  another “well  only way we can find out   try lou  i have different notions about feeding stock  that’s  good thing it’s bad if all  members   family think alike they never get anywhere lou can learn  my mistakes  i can learn  his isn’t  fair barney” the irishman laughed he had no love  lou who  always uppish  him  who said  alexandra paid her hands too much “i’ve no thought but  give  thing  honest try mum ’t would  only right after puttin’ so much expense into it maybe emil  come out an’ have  look   wid me” he pushed back his chair took his hat   nail  marched out  emil who  his university ideas  supposed  have instigated  silo the other hands followed them all except old ivar he had been depressed throughout  meal  had paid no heed   talk   men even when they mentioned cornstalk bloat upon which   sure  have opinions “did you want  speak  me ivar” alexandra asked  she rose   table “come into  sittingroom” the old man followed alexandra but when she motioned him   chair  shook his head she took up her workbasket  waited  him  speak he stood looking   carpet his bushy head bowed his hands clasped  front  him ivar’s bandy legs seemed  have grown shorter  years  they  completely misfitted  his broad thick body  heavy shoulders “well ivar what  it” alexandra asked after she had waited longer than usual ivar had never learned  speak english  his norwegian  quaint  grave like  speech   more oldfashioned people he always addressed alexandra  terms   deepest respect hoping  set  good example   kitchen girls whom  thought too familiar  their manners “mistress”  began faintly without raising his eyes “the folk have been looking coldly  me  late you know there  been talk” “talk about what ivar” “about sending me away   asylum” alexandra put down her sewingbasket “nobody  come  me  such talk” she said decidedly “why need you listen you know i would never consent  such  thing” ivar lifted his shaggy head  looked  her out  his little eyes “they say  you cannot prevent  if  folk complain  me if your brothers complain   authorities they say  your brothers  afraid—god forbid—that i may do you some injury when my spells   me mistress how can any one think that—that i could bite  hand  fed me” the tears trickled down   old man’s beard alexandra frowned “ivar i wonder  you  you should come bothering me  such nonsense i am still running my own house  other people have nothing  do  either you or me so long  i am suited  you there  nothing   said” ivar pulled  red handkerchief out   breast  his blouse  wiped his eyes  beard “but i should not wish you  keep me if  they say   against your interests  if   hard  you  get hands because i am here” alexandra made  impatient gesture but  old man put out his hand  went  earnestly— “listen mistress   right  you should take these things into account you know  my spells come  god   i would not harm any living creature you believe  every one should worship god   way revealed  him but   not  way  this country the way here   all  do alike i am despised because i do not wear shoes because i do not cut my hair  because i have visions at home   old country there  many like me who had been touched  god or who had seen things   graveyard  night   different afterward we thought nothing  it  let them alone but here if  man  different  his feet or  his head they put him   asylum look  peter kralik when    boy drinking out   creek  swallowed  snake  always after   could eat only such food   creature liked  when  ate anything else  became enraged  gnawed him

built  asylum  people who  different  they  not even let us live   holes   badgers only your great prosperity  protected me so far if you had had illfortune they would have taken me  hastings long ago” as ivar talked his gloom lifted alexandra had found  she could often break his fasts  long penances  talking  him  letting him pour out  thoughts  troubled him sympathy always cleared his mind  ridicule  poison  him “there   great deal  what you say ivar like  not they   wanting  take me  hastings because i have built  silo  then i may take you  me but  present i need you here only don’t come  me again telling me what people say let people go  talking  they like  we  go  living  we think best you have been  me now  twelve years  i have gone  you  advice oftener than i have ever gone  any one that ought  satisfy you” ivar bowed humbly “yes mistress i shall not trouble you  their talk again and   my feet i have observed your wishes all these years though you have never questioned me washing them every night even  winter” alexandra laughed “oh never mind about your feet ivar we can remember when half our neighbors went barefoot  summer i expect old mrs lee would love  slip her shoes off now sometimes if she dared i’m glad i’m not lou’s motherinlaw” ivar looked about mysteriously  lowered his voice almost   whisper “you know what they have over  lou’s house a great white tub like  stone watertroughs   old country  wash themselves in when you sent me over   strawberries they  all  town but  old woman lee   baby she took me   showed me  thing  she told me   impossible  wash yourself clean  it because  so much water you could not make  strong suds so when they fill  up  send her  there she pretends  makes  splashing noise then when they  all asleep she washes herself   little wooden tub she keeps under her bed” alexandra shook  laughter “poor old mrs lee they won’t let her wear nightcaps either never mind when she comes  visit me she can do all  old things   old way  have  much beer  she wants we’ll start  asylum  oldtime people ivar” ivar folded his big handkerchief carefully  thrust  back into his blouse “this  always  way mistress i come  you sorrowing  you send me away   light heart and  you  so good   tell  irishman    not  work  brown gelding until  sore   shoulder  healed” “that i will now go  put emil’s mare   cart i am going  drive up   north

superintendent   asylum  i  telling him about ivar’s symptoms he says ivar’s case  one   most dangerous kind  it’s  wonder  hasn’t done something violent before this” alexandra laughed goodhumoredly “oh nonsense lou the doctors would have us all crazy if they could ivar’s queer certainly but   more sense than half  hands i hire” lou flew  his fried chicken “oh i guess  doctor knows his business alexandra he  very much surprised when i told him how you’d put up  ivar he says he’s likely  set fire   barn any night or  take after you   girls   axe” little signa who  waiting   table giggled  fled   kitchen alexandra’s eyes twinkled “that  too much  signa lou we all know  ivar’s perfectly harmless the girls would  soon expect me  chase them   axe” lou flushed  signaled  his wife “all  same  neighbors   having  say about  before long he may burn anybody’s barn it’s only necessary  one propertyowner   township  make complaint  he’ll  taken up  force you’d better send him yourself  not have any hard feelings” alexandra helped one  her little nephews  gravy “well lou if any   neighbors try that i’ll have myself appointed ivar’s guardian  take  case  court that’s all i am perfectly satisfied  him” “pass  preserves lou” said annie   warning tone she had reasons  not wishing her husband  cross alexandra too openly “but don’t you sort  hate  have people see him around here alexandra” she went   persuasive smoothness “he is  disgraceful object  you’re fixed up so nice now it sort  makes people distant  you when they never know when they’ll hear him scratching about my girls  afraid  death  him aren’t you milly dear” milly  fifteen fat  jolly  pompadoured   creamy complexion square white teeth   short upper lip she looked like her grandmother bergson  had her comfortable  comfortloving nature she grinned  her aunt  whom she   great deal more  ease than she   her mother alexandra winked  reply “milly needn’t  afraid  ivar she’s  especial favorite  his in my opinion ivar  just  much right  his own way  dressing  thinking  we have but i’ll see   doesn’t bother other people i’ll keep him  home so don’t trouble any more about him lou i’ve been wanting  ask

going  get  piano  milly” oscar   end   table looked up  his plate “what does milly want   pianny what’s  matter  her organ she can make some use  that  play  church” annie looked flustered she had begged alexandra not  say anything about this plan before oscar who  apt   jealous  what his sister did  lou’s children alexandra did not get   oscar’s wife  all “milly can play  church just  same  she’ll still play   organ but practising   so much spoils her touch her teacher says so” annie brought out  spirit oscar rolled his eyes “well milly must have got  pretty good if she’s got past  organ i know plenty  grown folks  ain’t”  said bluntly annie threw up her chin “she  got  good  she’s going  play  her commencement when she graduates  town next year” “yes” said alexandra firmly “i think milly deserves  piano all  girls around here have been taking lessons  years but milly   only one  them who can ever play anything when you ask her i’ll tell you when i first thought i would like  give you  piano milly    when you learned  book  old swedish songs  your grandfather used  sing he had  sweet tenor voice  when    young man  loved  sing i can remember hearing him singing   sailors down   shipyard when i  no bigger than stella here” pointing  annie’s younger daughter milly  stella both looked through  door into  sittingroom where  crayon portrait  john bergson hung   wall alexandra had had  made   little photograph taken  his friends just before  left sweden  slender man  thirtyfive  soft hair curling about his high forehead  drooping mustache  wondering sad eyes  looked forward into  distance  if they already beheld  new world after dinner lou  oscar went   orchard  pick cherries—they had neither  them had  patience  grow  orchard  their own—and annie went down  gossip  alexandra’s kitchen girls while they washed  dishes she could always find out more about alexandra’s domestic economy   prattling maids than  alexandra herself  what she discovered she used  her own advantage  lou on  divide farmers’ daughters no longer went out into service so alexandra got her girls  sweden  paying their fare over they stayed  her until they married   replaced  sisters or cousins   old country alexandra took her three nieces into  flower garden she  fond   little girls especially  milly who came  spend  week  her aunt now  then  read aloud  her   old books about  house or listened  stories about  early days   divide while they  walking among  flower beds  buggy drove up  hill  stopped  front   gate a man got out  stood talking   driver the little girls  delighted   advent   stranger some one  very far away they knew  his clothes his gloves   sharp pointed cut  his dark beard the girls fell behind their aunt  peeped out  him  among  castor beans the stranger came up   gate  stood holding his hat  his hand smiling while alexandra advanced slowly  meet him as she approached  spoke   low pleasant voice “don’t you know me alexandra i would have known you anywhere” alexandra shaded her eyes  her hand suddenly she took  quick step forward “can  be” she exclaimed  feeling “can      carl linstrum why carl  is” she threw out both her hands  caught his across  gate “sadie milly run tell your father  uncle oscar  our old friend carl linstrum  here be quick why carl how did  happen i can’t believe this” alexandra shook  tears  her eyes  laughed the stranger nodded  his driver dropped his suitcase inside  fence  opened  gate “then you  glad  see me  you can put me up overnight i couldn’t go through this country without stopping off  have  look  you how little you have changed do you know i  sure  would  like that you simply couldn’t  different how fine you are” he stepped back  looked  her admiringly alexandra blushed  laughed again “but you yourself carl—with  beard—how could i have known you you went away  little boy” she reached  his suitcase  when  intercepted her she threw up her hands “you see i give myself away i have only women come  visit me  i do not know how  behave where  your trunk” “it’s  hanover i can stay only  few days i am  my way   coast” they started up  path “a few days after all these years” alexandra shook her finger  him “see this you have walked into  trap you do not get away so easy” she put her hand affectionately  his shoulder “you owe me  visit   sake  old times why must you go   coast  all” “oh i must i am  fortune hunter from seattle i go   alaska” “alaska” she looked  him  astonishment “are you going  paint  indians” “paint”  young man frowned “oh i’m not  painter alexandra i’m  engraver i have nothing  do  painting” “but  my parlor wall i have  paintings—” he interrupted nervously “oh watercolor sketches—done  amusement i sent them  remind you  me not because they  good what  wonderful place you have made  this alexandra” he turned  looked back   wide maplike prospect  field  hedge  pasture “i would never have believed  could  done i’m disappointed  my own eye  my imagination” at this moment lou  oscar came up  hill   orchard they did not quicken their pace when they saw carl indeed they did not openly look  his direction they advanced distrustfully   if they wished  distance  longer alexandra beckoned  them “they think i am trying  fool them come boys it’s carl linstrum our old carl” lou gave  visitor  quick sidelong glance  thrust out his hand “glad  see you” oscar followed  “how d’ do” carl could not tell whether their offishness came  unfriendliness or  embarrassment he  alexandra led  way   porch “carl” alexandra explained “is  his way  seattle he  going  alaska” oscar studied  visitor’s yellow shoes “got business there”  asked carl laughed “yes very pressing business i’m going there  get rich engraving’s  very interesting profession but  man never makes any money  it so i’m going  try  goldfields” alexandra felt  this   tactful speech  lou looked up  some interest “ever done anything   line before” “no but i’m going  join  friend  mine who went out  new york   done well he  offered  break me in” “turrible cold winters there i hear” remarked oscar “i thought people went up there   spring” “they do but my friend  going  spend  winter  seattle  i am  stay  him there  learn something about prospecting before we start north next year” lou looked skeptical “let’s see how long have you been away  here” “sixteen years you ought  remember that lou  you  married just after we went away” “going  stay  us some time” oscar asked “a few days if alexandra can keep me” “i expect you’ll  wanting  see your old place” lou observed more cordially “you won’t hardly know it but there’s  few chunks  your old sod house left alexandra wouldn’t never let frank shabata plough over it” annie lee who ever since  visitor  announced had been touching up her hair  settling her lace  wishing she had worn another dress now emerged  her three daughters  introduced them she  greatly impressed  carl’s urban appearance   her excitement talked very loud  threw her head about “and you ain’t married yet at your age now think  that you’ll have  wait  milly yes we’ve got  boy too the youngest he’s  home  his grandma you must come over  see mother  hear milly play she’s  musician   family she does pyrography too that’s burnt wood you know you wouldn’t believe what she can do  her poker yes she goes  school  town  she   youngest  her class  two years” milly looked uncomfortable  carl took her hand again he liked her creamy skin  happy innocent eyes   could see  her mother’s way  talking distressed her “i’m sure she’s  clever little girl”  murmured looking  her thoughtfully “let me see—ah it’s your mother  she looks like alexandra mrs bergson must have looked just like this when she   little girl does milly run about over  country  you  alexandra used to annie” milly’s mother protested “oh my no things  changed since we  girls milly   very different we  going  rent  place  move into town  soon   girls  old enough  go out into company a good many  doing  here now lou  going into business” lou grinned “that’s what she says you better go get your things on ivar’s hitching up”  added turning  annie young farmers seldom address their wives  name it  always “you” or “she” having got his wife out   way lou sat down   step  began  whittle “well what do folks  new york think  william jennings bryan” lou began  bluster   always did when  talked politics “we gave wall street  scare  ninetysix all right  we’re fixing another  hand them silver wasn’t  only issue”  nodded mysteriously “there’s  good many things got   changed the west  going  make itself heard” carl laughed “but surely  did do that if nothing else” lou’s thin face reddened up   roots  his bristly hair “oh we’ve only begun we’re waking up   sense  our responsibilities out here  we ain’t afraid neither you fellows back there must   tame lot if you had any nerve you’d get together  march down  wall street  blow  up dynamite it i mean”   threatening nod he  so much  earnest  carl scarcely knew how  answer him “that would   waste  powder the same business would go   another street the street doesn’t matter but what have you fellows out here got  kick about you have  only safe place there is morgan himself couldn’t touch you one only   drive through this country  see  you’re all  rich  barons” “we have  good deal more  say than we had when we  poor” said lou threateningly “we’re getting    whole lot  things” as ivar drove  double carriage up   gate annie came out   hat  looked like  model   battleship carl rose  took her down   carriage while lou lingered   word  his sister “what do you suppose he’s come for”  asked jerking his head toward  gate “why  pay us  visit i’ve been begging him   years” oscar looked  alexandra “he didn’t let you know   coming” “no why should he i told him  come  any time” lou shrugged his shoulders “he doesn’t seem  have done much  himself wandering around this way” oscar spoke solemnly    depths   cavern “he never  much account” alexandra left them  hurried down   gate where annie  rattling   carl about her new diningroom furniture “you must bring mr linstrum over real soon only  sure  telephone me first” she called back  carl helped her into  carriage old ivar his white head bare stood holding  horses lou came down  path  climbed into  front seat took up  reins  drove off without saying anything further  any one oscar picked up his youngest boy  trudged off down  road  other three trotting after him carl holding  gate open  alexandra began  laugh “up  coming   divide eh alexandra”  cried gayly iv carl had changed alexandra felt much less than one might have expected he had not become  trim selfsatisfied city man there  still something homely  wayward  definitely personal about him even his clothes his norfolk coat  his very high collars   little unconventional he seemed  shrink into himself   used  do  hold himself away  things  if   afraid  being hurt in short   more selfconscious than  man  thirtyfive  expected  be he looked older than his years  not very strong his black hair which still hung   triangle over his pale forehead  thin   crown  there  fine relentless lines about his eyes his back   high sharp shoulders looked like  back   overworked german professor off  his holiday his face  intelligent sensitive unhappy that evening after supper carl  alexandra  sitting   clump  castor beans   middle   flower garden the gravel paths glittered   moonlight  below them  fields lay white  still “do you know alexandra”   saying “i’ve been thinking how strangely things work out i’ve been away engraving other men’s pictures  you’ve stayed  home  made your own” he pointed  his cigar toward  sleeping landscape “how   world have you done it how have your neighbors done it” “we hadn’t any  us much  do  it carl the land did it it had  little joke it pretended   poor because nobody knew how  work  right  then all  once  worked itself it woke up out   sleep  stretched itself    so big so rich  we suddenly found we  rich just  sitting still as  me you remember when i began  buy land for years after  i  always squeezing  borrowing until i  ashamed  show my face   banks and then all  once men began  come  me offering  lend me money—and i didn’t need it then i went ahead  built this house i really built   emil i want you  see emil carl he  so different   rest  us” “how different” “oh you’ll see i’m sure    have sons like emil   give them  chance  father left  old country it’s curious too   outside emil  just like  american boy—he graduated   state university  june you know—but underneath   more swedish than any  us sometimes   so like father   frightens me   so violent  his feelings like that” “is  going  farm here  you” “he shall do whatever  wants to” alexandra declared warmly “he  going  have  chance  whole chance that’s what i’ve worked for sometimes  talks about studying law  sometimes just lately he’s been talking about going out into  sand hills  taking up more land he  his sad times like father but i hope  won’t do that we have land enough  last” alexandra laughed “how about lou  oscar they’ve done well haven’t they” “yes very well but they  different  now  they have farms  their own i do not see so much  them we divided  land equally when lou married they have their own way  doing things  they do not altogether like my way i am afraid perhaps they think me too independent but i have had  think  myself  good many years  am not likely  change on  whole though we take  much comfort  each other  most brothers  sisters do and i am very fond  lou’s oldest daughter” “i think i liked  old lou  oscar better  they probably feel  same about me i even if you can keep  secret”—carl leaned forward  touched her arm smiling—“i even think i liked  old country better this  all very splendid   way but there  something about this country when    wild old beast   haunted me all these years now when i come back  all this milk  honey i feel like  old german song ‘wo bist du wo bist du mein geliebtest land’—do you ever feel like that i wonder” “yes sometimes when i think about father  mother  those who  gone so many  our old neighbors” alexandra paused  looked up thoughtfully   stars “we can remember  graveyard when   wild prairie carl  now—” “and now  old story  begun  write itself over there” said carl softly “isn’t  queer there  only two or three human stories  they go  repeating themselves  fiercely  if they had never happened before like  larks  this country  have been singing  same five notes over  thousands  years” “oh yes the young people they live so hard and yet i sometimes envy them there  my little neighbor now  people who bought your old place i wouldn’t have sold   any one else but i  always fond   girl you must remember her little marie tovesky  omaha who used  visit here when she  eighteen she ran away   convent school  got married crazy child she came out here  bride  her father  husband he had nothing   old man  willing  buy them  place  set them up your farm took her fancy  i  glad  have her so near me i’ve never been sorry either i even try  get along  frank  her account” “is frank her husband” “yes he’s one  these wild fellows most bohemians  goodnatured but frank thinks we don’t appreciate him here i guess he’s jealous about everything his farm  his horses  his pretty wife everybody likes her just  same  when she  little sometimes i go up   catholic church  emil  it’s funny  see marie standing there laughing  shaking hands  people looking so excited  gay  frank sulking behind her  if  could eat everybody alive frank’s not  bad neighbor but  get   him you’ve got  make  fuss over him  act  if you thought    very important person all  time  different  other people i find  hard  keep  up  one year’s end  another” “i shouldn’t think you’d  very successful   kind  thing alexandra” carl seemed  find  idea amusing “well” said alexandra firmly “i do  best i can  marie’s account she   hard enough anyway she’s too young  pretty  this sort  life we’re all ever so much older  slower but she’s  kind  won’t  downed easily she’ll work all day  go   bohemian wedding  dance all night  drive  hay wagon   cross man next morning i could stay   job but i never had  go  me  she has when i  going my best i’ll have  take you over  see her tomorrow” carl dropped  end  his cigar softly among  castor beans  sighed “yes i suppose i must see  old place i’m cowardly about things  remind me  myself it took courage  come  all alexandra i wouldn’t have if i hadn’t wanted  see you very very much” alexandra looked  him  her calm deliberate eyes “why do you dread things like that carl” she asked earnestly “why  you dissatisfied  yourself” her visitor winced “how direct you are alexandra just like you used  be do i give myself away so quickly well you see  one thing there’s nothing  look forward   my profession woodengraving   only thing i care about   had gone out before i began everything’s cheap metal work nowadays touching up miserable photographs forcing up poor drawings  spoiling good ones i’m absolutely sick   all” carl frowned “alexandra all  way out  new york i’ve been planning how i could deceive you  make you think me  very enviable fellow  here i am telling you  truth  first night i waste  lot  time pretending  people   joke   is i don’t think i ever deceive any one there  too many  my kind people know us  sight” carl paused alexandra pushed her hair back  her brow   puzzled thoughtful gesture “you see”  went  calmly “measured  your standards here i’m  failure i couldn’t buy even one  your cornfields i’ve enjoyed  great many things but i’ve got nothing  show   all” “but you show   yourself carl i’d rather have had your freedom than my land” carl shook his head mournfully “freedom so often means  one isn’t needed anywhere here you   individual you have  background  your own you would  missed but off there   cities there  thousands  rolling stones like me we  all alike we have no ties we know nobody we own nothing when one  us dies they scarcely know where  bury him our landlady   delicatessen man  our mourners  we leave nothing behind us but  frockcoat   fiddle or  easel or  typewriter or whatever tool we got our living by all we have ever managed  do   pay our rent  exorbitant rent  one   pay   few square feet  space near  heart  things we have no house no place no people  our own we live   streets   parks   theatres we sit  restaurants  concert halls  look about   hundreds  our own kind  shudder” alexandra  silent she sat looking   silver spot  moon made   surface   pond down   pasture he knew  she understood what  meant at last she said slowly “and yet i would rather have emil grow up like  than like his two brothers we pay  high rent too though we pay differently we grow hard  heavy here we don’t move lightly  easily  you do  our minds get stiff if  world  no wider than my cornfields if there  not something beside this i wouldn’t feel    much worth while  work no i would rather have emil like you than like them i felt   soon  you came” “i wonder why you feel like that” carl mused “i don’t know perhaps i am like carrie jensen  sister  one  my hired men she had never been out   cornfields   few years ago she got despondent  said life  just  same thing over  over  she didn’t see  use  it after she had tried  kill herself once or twice her folks got worried  sent her over  iowa  visit some relations ever since she’s come back she’s been perfectly cheerful  she says she’s contented  live  work   world that’s so big  interesting she said  anything  big   bridges over  platte   missouri reconciled her and it’s what goes    world  reconciles me” v alexandra did not find time  go  her neighbor’s  next day nor  next it   busy season   farm   cornplowing going on  even emil    field   team  cultivator carl went about over  farms  alexandra   morning    afternoon  evening they found  great deal  talk about emil  all his track practice did not stand up under farmwork very well   night   too tired  talk or even  practise  his cornet on wednesday morning carl got up before   light  stole downstairs  out   kitchen door just  old ivar  making his morning ablutions   pump carl nodded  him  hurried up  draw past  garden  into  pasture where  milking cows used   kept the dawn   east looked like  light  some great fire   burning under  edge   world the color  reflected   globules  dew  sheathed  short gray pasture grass carl walked rapidly until  came   crest   second hill where  bergson pasture joined  one  had belonged  his father there  sat down  waited   sun  rise it  just there    alexandra used  do their milking together   his side   fence she  hers he could remember exactly how she looked when she came over  closecropped grass her skirts pinned up her head bare  bright tin pail  either hand   milky light   early morning all about her even   boy  used  feel when  saw her coming  her free step her upright head  calm shoulders  she looked  if she had walked straight out   morning itself since then when  had happened  see  sun come up   country or   water  had often remembered  young swedish girl  her milking pails carl sat musing until  sun leaped above  prairie    grass about him all  small creatures  day began  tune their tiny instruments birds  insects without number began  chirp  twitter  snap  whistle  make all manner  fresh shrill noises the pasture  flooded  light every clump  ironweed  snowonthemountain threw  long shadow   golden light seemed   rippling through  curly grass like  tide racing in he crossed  fence into  pasture   now  shabatas’  continued his walk toward  pond he had not gone far however when  discovered    not  only person abroad in  draw below his gun  his hands  emil advancing cautiously   young woman beside him they  moving softly keeping close together  carl knew  they expected  find ducks   pond at  moment when they came  sight   bright spot  water  heard  whirr  wings   ducks shot up into  air there   sharp crack   gun  five   birds fell   ground emil  his companion laughed delightedly  emil ran  pick them up when  came back dangling  ducks  their feet marie held her apron   dropped them into it as she stood looking down  them her face changed she took up one   birds  rumpled ball  feathers   blood dripping slowly   mouth  looked   live color  still burned   plumage as she let  fall she cried  distress “oh emil why did you” “i like that”  boy exclaimed indignantly “why marie you asked me  come yourself” “yes yes i know” she said tearfully “but i didn’t think i hate  see them when they  first shot they  having such  good time  we’ve spoiled  all  them” emil gave  rather sore laugh “i should say we had i’m not going hunting  you any more you’re  bad  ivar here let me take them” he snatched  ducks out  her apron “don’t  cross emil only—ivar’s right about wild things they’re too happy  kill you can tell just how they felt when they flew up they  scared but they didn’t really think anything could hurt them no we won’t do  any more” “all right” emil assented “i’m sorry i made you feel bad” as  looked down into her tearful eyes there   curious sharp young bitterness  his own carl watched them  they moved slowly down  draw they had not seen him  all he had not overheard much  their dialogue but  felt  import  it it made him somehow unreasonably mournful  find two young things abroad   pasture   early morning he decided   needed his breakfast vi at dinner  day alexandra said she thought they must really manage  go over   shabatas’  afternoon “it’s not often i let three days go  without seeing marie she  think i have forsaken her now  my old friend  come back” after  men had gone back  work alexandra put   white dress  her sunhat  she  carl set forth across  fields “you see we have kept up  old path carl it  been so nice  me  feel  there   friend   other end   again” carl smiled  little ruefully “all  same i hope  hasn’t been quite  same” alexandra looked  him  surprise “why no  course not not  same she could not very well take your place if that’s what you mean i’m friendly  all my neighbors i hope but marie  really  companion some one i can talk  quite frankly you wouldn’t want me   more lonely than i have been would you” carl laughed  pushed back  triangular lock  hair   edge  his hat “of course i don’t i ought   thankful  this path hasn’t been worn by—well  friends  more pressing errands than your little bohemian  likely  have” he paused  give alexandra his hand  she stepped over  stile “are you  least bit disappointed  our coming together again”  asked abruptly “is   way you hoped  would be” alexandra smiled  this “only better when i’ve thought about your coming i’ve sometimes been  little afraid  it you have lived where things move so fast  everything  slow here  people slowest  all our lives  like  years all made up  weather  crops  cows how you hated cows” she shook her head  laughed  herself “i didn’t when we milked together i walked up   pasture corners this morning i wonder whether i shall ever  able  tell you all  i  thinking about up there it’s  strange thing alexandra i find  easy   frank  you about everything under  sun except—yourself” “you  afraid  hurting my feelings perhaps” alexandra looked  him thoughtfully “no i’m afraid  giving you  shock you’ve seen yourself  so long   dull minds   people about you  if i   tell you how you seem  me  would startle you but you must see  you astonish me you must feel when people admire you” alexandra blushed  laughed  some confusion “i felt  you  pleased  me if you mean that” “and you’ve felt when other people  pleased  you”  insisted “well sometimes the men  town   banks   county offices seem glad  see me i think myself   more pleasant  do business  people who  clean  healthylooking” she admitted blandly carl gave  little chuckle   opened  shabatas’ gate  her “oh do you”  asked dryly there  no sign  life about  shabatas’ house except  big yellow cat sunning itself   kitchen doorstep alexandra took  path  led   orchard “she often sits there  sews i didn’t telephone her we  coming because i didn’t want her  go  work  bake cake  freeze icecream she’ll always make  party if you give her  least excuse do you recognize  apple trees carl” linstrum looked about him “i wish i had  dollar  every bucket  water i’ve carried  those trees poor father    easy man but   perfectly merciless when  came  watering  orchard” “that’s one thing i like about germans they make  orchard grow if they can’t make anything else i’m so glad these trees belong  some one who takes comfort  them when i rented this place  tenants never kept  orchard up  emil  i used  come over  take care   ourselves it needs mowing now there she is down   corner mariaaa” she called a recumbent figure started up   grass  came running toward them through  flickering screen  light  shade “look  her isn’t she like  little brown rabbit” alexandra laughed maria ran up panting  threw her arms about alexandra “oh i had begun  think you  not coming  all maybe i knew you  so busy yes emil told me about mr linstrum being here won’t you come up   house” “why not sit down there  your corner carl wants  see  orchard he kept all these trees alive  years watering them  his own back” marie turned  carl “then i’m thankful  you mr linstrum we’d never have bought  place if  hadn’t been  this orchard  then i wouldn’t have had alexandra either” she gave alexandra’s arm  little squeeze  she walked beside her “how nice your dress smells alexandra you put rosemary leaves  your chest like i told you” she led them   northwest corner   orchard sheltered  one side   thick mulberry hedge  bordered   other   wheatfield just beginning  yellow in this corner  ground dipped  little   bluegrass which  weeds had driven out   upper part   orchard grew thick  luxuriant wild roses  flaming   tufts  bunchgrass along  fence under  white mulberry tree there   old wagonseat beside  lay  book   workbasket “you must have  seat alexandra the grass would stain your dress”  hostess insisted she dropped down   ground  alexandra’s side  tucked her feet under her carl sat   little distance   two women his back   wheatfield  watched them alexandra took off her shadehat  threw    ground marie picked  up  played   white ribbons twisting them about her brown fingers  she talked they made  pretty picture   strong sunlight  leafy pattern surrounding them like  net  swedish woman so white  gold kindly  amused but armored  calm   alert brown one her full lips parted points  yellow light dancing  her eyes  she laughed  chattered carl had never forgotten little marie tovesky’s eyes    glad  have  opportunity  study them the brown iris  found  curiously slashed  yellow  color  sunflower honey or  old amber in each eye one  these streaks must have been larger than  others   effect    two dancing points  light two little yellow bubbles such  rise   glass  champagne sometimes they seemed like  sparks   forge she seemed so easily excited  kindle   fierce little flame if one but breathed upon her “what  waste” carl reflected “she ought   doing all    sweetheart how awkwardly things come about” it  not very long before marie sprang up out   grass again “wait  moment i want  show you something” she ran away  disappeared behind  lowgrowing apple trees “what  charming creature” carl murmured “i don’t wonder  her husband  jealous but can’t she walk does she always run” alexandra nodded “always i don’t see many people but i don’t believe there  many like her anywhere” marie came back   branch she had broken   apricot tree laden  pale yellow pinkcheeked fruit she dropped  beside carl “did you plant those too they  such beautiful little trees” carl fingered  bluegreen leaves porous like blottingpaper  shaped like birch leaves hung  waxen red stems “yes i think i did are these  circus trees alexandra” “shall i tell her about them” alexandra asked “sit down like  good girl marie  don’t ruin my poor hat  i’ll tell you  story a long time ago when carl  i were say sixteen  twelve  circus came  hanover  we went  town  our wagon  lou  oscar  see  parade we hadn’t money enough  go   circus we followed  parade out   circus grounds  hung around until  show began   crowd went inside  tent then lou  afraid we looked foolish standing outside   pasture so we went back  hanover feeling very sad there   man   streets selling apricots  we had never seen any before he had driven down  somewhere up   french country    selling them twentyfive cents  peck we had  little money our fathers had given us  candy  i bought two pecks  carl bought one they cheered us  good deal  we saved all  seeds  planted them up   time carl went away they hadn’t borne  all” “and now he’s come back  eat them” cried marie nodding  carl “that is  good story i can remember you  little mr linstrum i used  see you  hanover sometimes when uncle joe took me  town i remember you because you  always buying pencils  tubes  paint   drug store once when my uncle left me   store you drew  lot  little birds  flowers  me   piece  wrappingpaper i kept them   long while i thought you  very romantic because you could draw  had such black eyes” carl smiled “yes i remember  time your uncle bought you some kind   mechanical toy  turkish lady sitting   ottoman  smoking  hookah wasn’t it and she turned her head backwards  forwards” “oh yes wasn’t she splendid i knew well enough i ought not  tell uncle joe i wanted it   had just come back   saloon   feeling good you remember how  laughed she tickled him too but when we got home my aunt scolded him  buying toys when she needed so many things we wound our lady up every night  when she began  move her head my aunt used  laugh  hard  any  us it   musicbox you know   turkish lady played  tune while she smoked that  how she made you feel so jolly as i remember her she  lovely  had  gold crescent  her turban” half  hour later  they  leaving  house carl  alexandra  met   path   strapping fellow  overalls   blue shirt he  breathing hard  if  had been running   muttering  himself marie ran forward and taking him   arm gave him  little push toward her guests “frank this  mr linstrum” frank took off his broad straw hat  nodded  alexandra when  spoke  carl  showed  fine set  white teeth he  burned  dull red down  his neckband  there   heavy threedays’ stubble  his face even  his agitation   handsome but  looked  rash  violent man barely saluting  callers  turned  once  his wife  began   outraged tone “i have  leave my team  drive  old woman hiller’s hogs outa my wheat i go  take dat old woman  de court if she ain’t careful i tell

hogtight her fences you’d save time  yourself   end” frank’s neck stiffened “notamuch i won’t i keep my hogs home other peoples can do like me see if  louis can mend shoes  can mend fence” “maybe” said alexandra placidly “but i’ve found  sometimes pays  mend other people’s fences goodbye marie come  see me soon” alexandra walked firmly down  path  carl followed her frank went into  house  threw himself   sofa his face   wall his clenched fist  his hip marie having seen her guests off came   put her hand coaxingly  his shoulder “poor frank you’ve run until you’ve made your head ache now haven’t you let me make you some coffee” “what else am i  do”  cried hotly  bohemian “am i  let any old woman’s hogs root up my wheat is  what i work myself  death for” “don’t worry about it frank i’ll speak  mrs hiller again but really she almost cried last time they got out she  so sorry” frank bounced over  his other side “that’s it you always side  them against me they all know it anybody here feels free  borrow  mower  break it or turn their hogs   me they know you won’t care” marie hurried away  make his coffee when she came back   fast asleep she sat down  looked  him   long while very thoughtfully when  kitchen clock struck six she went out  get supper closing  door gently behind her she  always sorry  frank when  worked himself into one  these rages  she  sorry  have him

after  rain oh but i’m glad  get this place mowed when i heard  raining   night i thought maybe you would come  do   me today the wind wakened me didn’t  blow dreadfully just smell  wild roses they  always so spicy after  rain we never had so many  them  here before i suppose it’s  wet season will you have  cut them too” “if i cut  grass i will” emil said teasingly “what’s  matter  you what makes you so flighty” “am i flighty i suppose that’s  wet season too then it’s exciting  see everything growing so fast—and  get  grass cut please leave  roses till last if you must cut them oh i don’t mean all  them i mean  low place down  my tree where there  so many aren’t you splashed look   spiderwebs all over  grass goodbye i’ll call you if i see  snake” she tripped away  emil stood looking after her in  few moments  heard  cherries dropping smartly into  pail   began  swing his scythe   long even stroke  few american boys ever learn marie picked cherries  sang softly  herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught  shower  raindrops  her neck  hair and emil mowed his way slowly down toward  cherry trees that summer  rains had been so many  opportune    almost more than shabata  his man could do  keep up   corn  orchard   neglected wilderness all sorts  weeds  herbs  flowers had grown up there splotches  wild larkspur pale greenandwhite spikes  hoarhound plantations  wild cotton tangles  foxtail  wild wheat south   apricot trees cornering   wheatfield  frank’s alfalfa where myriads  white  yellow butterflies  always fluttering above  purple blossoms when emil reached  lower corner   hedge marie  sitting under her white mulberry tree  pailful  cherries beside her looking off   gentle tireless swelling   wheat “emil” she said suddenly—he  mowing quietly about under  tree so  not  disturb her—“what religion did  swedes have away back before they  christians” emil paused  straightened his back “i don’t know about like  germans’ wasn’t it” marie went   if she had not heard him “the bohemians you know  tree worshipers before  missionaries came father says  people   mountains still do queer things sometimes—they believe  trees bring good or bad luck” emil looked superior “do they well which   lucky trees i’d like  know” “i don’t know all  them but i know lindens are the old people   mountains plant lindens  purify  forest   do away   spells  come   old trees they say have lasted  heathen times i’m  good catholic but i think i could get along  caring  trees if i hadn’t anything else” “that’s  poor saying” said emil stooping over  wipe his hands   wet grass “why  it if i feel  way i feel  way i like trees because they seem more resigned   way they have  live than other things do i feel  if this tree knows everything i ever think  when i sit here when i come back  it i never have  remind   anything i begin just where i left off” emil had nothing  say  this he reached up among  branches  began  pick  sweet insipid fruit—long ivorycolored berries tipped  faint pink like white coral  fall   ground unheeded all summer through he dropped  handful into her lap “do you like mr linstrum” marie asked suddenly “yes don’t you” “oh ever so much only  seems kind  staid  schoolteachery but  course   older than frank even i’m sure i don’t want  live   more than thirty do you do you think alexandra likes him very much” “i suppose so they  old friends” “oh emil you know what i mean” marie tossed her head impatiently “does she really care about him when she used  tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasn’t  little  love  him” “who alexandra” emil laughed  thrust his hands into his trousers pockets “alexandra’s never been  love you crazy” he laughed again “she wouldn’t know how  go about it the idea” marie shrugged her shoulders “oh you don’t know alexandra  well  you think you do if you had any eyes you would see  she  very fond  him it would serve you all right if she walked off  carl i like him because  appreciates her more than you do” emil frowned “what  you talking about marie alexandra’s all right she  i have always been good friends what more do you want i like  talk  carl about new york  what  fellow can do there” “oh emil surely you  not thinking  going off there” “why not i must go somewhere mustn’t i” the young man took up his scythe  leaned  it “would you rather i went off   sand hills  lived like ivar” marie’s face fell under his brooding gaze she looked down  his wet leggings “i’m sure alexandra hopes you  stay  here” she murmured “then alexandra   disappointed”  young man said roughly “what do i want  hang around here for alexandra can run  farm all right without me i don’t want  stand around  look on i want   doing something  my own account” “that’s so” marie sighed “there  so many many things you can do almost anything you choose” “and there  so many many things i can’t do” emil echoed her tone sarcastically “sometimes i don’t want  do anything  all  sometimes i want  pull  four corners   divide together”—he threw out his arm  brought  back   jerk—“so like  tablecloth i get tired  seeing men  horses going up  down up  down” marie looked up  his defiant figure  her face clouded “i wish you weren’t so restless  didn’t get so worked up over things” she said sadly “thank you”  returned shortly she sighed despondently “everything i say makes you cross don’t it and you never used   cross  me” emil took  step nearer  stood frowning down  her bent head he stood   attitude  selfdefense his feet well apart his hands clenched  drawn up  his sides so   cords stood out  his bare arms “i can’t play  you like  little boy any more”  said slowly “that’s what you miss marie you’ll have  get some other little boy  play with” he stopped  took  deep breath then  went    low tone so intense    almost threatening “sometimes you seem  understand perfectly  then sometimes you pretend you don’t you don’t help things any  pretending it’s then  i want  pull  corners   divide together if you won’t understand you know i could make you” marie clasped her hands  started up  her seat she had grown very pale  her eyes  shining  excitement  distress “but emil if i understand then all our good times  over we can never do nice things together any more we shall have  behave like mr linstrum and anyhow there’s nothing  understand” she struck  ground  her little foot fiercely “that won’t last it  go away  things   just  they used to i wish you   catholic the church helps people indeed  does i pray  you but that’s not  same  if you prayed yourself” she spoke rapidly  pleadingly looked entreatingly into his face emil stood defiant gazing down  her “i can’t pray  have  things i want”  said slowly “and i won’t pray not  have them not if i’m damned  it” marie turned away wringing her hands “oh emil you won’t try then all our good times  over” “yes over i never expect  have any more” emil gripped  handholds  his scythe  began  mow marie took up her cherries  went slowly toward  house crying bitterly ix on sunday afternoon  month after carl linstrum’s arrival  rode  emil up into  french country  attend  catholic fair he sat  most   afternoon   basement   church where  fair  held talking  marie shabata or strolled about  gravel terrace thrown up   hillside  front   basement doors where  french boys  jumping  wrestling

more” he slapped emil   back   caught step  him “oh emil you wanna get married right off quick it’s  greatest thing ever” emil laughed “how am i going  get married without any girl” amédée took his arm “pooh there  plenty girls  have you you wanna get some nice french girl now she treat you well always  jolly see”—he began checking off  his fingers—“there  sévérine  alphosen  joséphine

’médée you frenchies like  brag” but amédée had  zeal   newly married    not   lightly shaken off “honest  true emil don’t you want any girl maybe there’s some young lady  lincoln now very grand”—amédée waved his hand languidly before his face  denote  fan  heartless beauty—“and you lost your heart up there is  it” “maybe” said emil but amédée saw no appropriate glow  his friend’s face “bah”  exclaimed  disgust “i tell all  french girls  keep ’way  you you gotta rock  there” thumping emil   ribs when they reached  terrace   side   church amédée who  excited  his success   ballgrounds challenged emil   jumpingmatch though  knew  would  beaten they belted themselves up  raoul marcel  choir tenor  father duchesne’s pet  jean bordelau held  string over which they vaulted

jumped any more angélique amédée’s pretty bride  blonde  fair  her name who had come out  watch  match tossed her head  emil  said— “’médée could jump much higher than you if    tall and anyhow   much more graceful he goes over like  bird  you have  hump yourself all up” “oh i do do i” emil caught her  kissed her saucy mouth squarely while she laughed  struggled  called “’médée ’médée” “there you see your ’médée isn’t even big enough  get you away  me i could run away  you right now   could only sit down  cry about it i’ll show you whether i have  hump myself” laughing  panting  picked angélique up  his arms  began running about  rectangle  her not until  saw marie shabata’s tiger eyes flashing   gloom   basement doorway did  hand  disheveled bride over  her husband “there go  your

shameless submission  it he  delighted  his friend’s good fortune he liked  see   think about amédée’s sunny natural happy love he  amédée had ridden  wrestled  larked together since they  lads  twelve on sundays  holidays they  always arm  arm it seemed strange  now  should have  hide  thing  amédée  so proud of   feeling which gave one  them such happiness should bring  other such despair it  like  when alexandra tested her seedcorn   spring  mused from two ears  had grown side  side  grains  one shot up joyfully into  light projecting themselves into  future   grains   other lay still   earth  rotted  nobody knew why x while emil  carl  amusing themselves   fair alexandra   home busy  her accountbooks which had been neglected  late she  almost through  her figures when she heard  cart drive up   gate  looking out   window she saw her two older brothers they had seemed  avoid her ever since carl linstrum’s arrival four weeks ago  day  she hurried   door  welcome them she saw  once  they had come  some very definite purpose they followed her stiffly into  sittingroom oscar sat down but lou walked over   window  remained standing his hands behind him “you   yourself”  asked looking toward  doorway into  parlor “yes carl  emil went up   catholic fair” for  few moments neither   men spoke then lou came out sharply “how soon does  intend  go away  here” “i don’t know lou not  some time i hope” alexandra spoke   even quiet tone  often exasperated her brothers they felt  she  trying   superior  them oscar spoke up grimly “we thought we ought  tell you  people have begun  talk”  said meaningly alexandra looked  him “what about” oscar met her eyes blankly “about you keeping him here so long it looks bad  him   hanging    woman this way people think you’re getting taken in” alexandra shut her accountbook firmly “boys” she said seriously “don’t let’s go   this we won’t come out anywhere i can’t take advice  such  matter i know you mean well but you must not feel responsible  me  things  this sort if we go   this talk   only make hard feeling” lou whipped about   window “you ought  think  little about your family you’re making us all ridiculous” “how am i” “people  beginning  say you want  marry  fellow” “well  what  ridiculous about that” lou  oscar exchanged outraged looks “alexandra can’t you see he’s just  tramp  he’s after your money he wants   taken care of  does” “well suppose i want  take care  him whose business   but my own” “don’t you know he’d get hold  your property” “he’d get hold  what i wished  give him certainly” oscar sat up suddenly  lou clutched  his bristly hair “give him” lou shouted “our property our homestead” “i don’t know about  homestead” said alexandra quietly “i know you  oscar have always expected   would  left  your children  i’m not sure but what you’re right but i’ll do exactly  i please   rest  my land boys” “the rest  your land” cried lou growing more excited every minute “didn’t all  land come out   homestead it  bought  money borrowed   homestead  oscar  me worked ourselves   bone paying interest  it” “yes you paid  interest but when you married we made  division   land  you  satisfied i’ve made more  my farms since i’ve been alone than when we all worked together” “everything you’ve made  come out   original land  us boys worked for hasn’t it the farms  all  comes out  them belongs  us   family” alexandra waved her hand impatiently “come now lou stick   facts you  talking nonsense go   county clerk  ask him who owns my land  whether my titles  good” lou turned  his brother “this  what comes  letting  woman meddle  business”  said bitterly “we ought  have taken things  our own hands years ago but she liked  run things  we humored her we thought you had good sense alexandra we never thought you’d do anything foolish” alexandra rapped impatiently  her desk  her knuckles “listen lou don’t talk wild you say you ought  have taken things into your own hands years ago i suppose you mean before you left home but how could you take hold  what wasn’t there i’ve got most  what i have now since we divided  property i’ve built  up myself    nothing  do  you” oscar spoke up solemnly “the property   family really belongs   men   family no matter about  title if anything goes wrong it’s  men   held responsible” “yes  course” lou broke in “everybody knows that oscar  me have always been easygoing  we’ve never made any fuss we  willing you should hold  land  have  good  it but you got no right  part  any  it we worked   fields  pay   first land you bought  whatever’s come out    got   kept   family” oscar reinforced his brother his mind fixed   one point  could see “the property   family belongs   men   family because they  held responsible  because they do  work” alexandra looked  one   other her eyes full  indignation she had been impatient before but now she  beginning  feel angry “and what about my work” she asked   unsteady voice lou looked   carpet “oh now alexandra you always took  pretty easy of course we wanted you to you liked  manage round  we always humored you we realize you   great deal  help  us there’s no woman anywhere around  knows  much about business  you do  we’ve always been proud  that  thought you  pretty smart but  course  real work always fell  us good advice  all right but  don’t get  weeds out   corn” “maybe not but  sometimes puts   crop   sometimes keeps  fields  corn  grow in” said alexandra dryly “why lou i can remember when you  oscar wanted  sell this homestead  all  improvements  old preacher ericson  two thousand dollars if i’d consented you’d have gone down   river  scraped along  poor farms   rest  your lives when i put  our first field  alfalfa you both opposed me just because i first heard about    young man who had been   university you said i  being taken  then  all  neighbors said so you know  well  i do  alfalfa  been  salvation  this country you all laughed  me when i said our land here  about ready  wheat  i had  raise three big wheat crops before  neighbors quit putting all their land  corn why i remember you cried lou when we put   first big wheatplanting  said everybody  laughing  us” lou turned  oscar “that’s  woman  it if she tells you  put   crop she thinks she’s put  in it makes women conceited  meddle  business i shouldn’t think you’d want  remind us how hard you   us alexandra after  way you baby emil” “hard  you i never meant   hard conditions  hard maybe i would never have been very soft anyhow but i certainly didn’t choose    kind  girl i was if you take even  vine  cut  back again  again  grows hard like  tree” lou felt  they  wandering   point    digression alexandra might unnerve him he wiped his forehead   jerk  his handkerchief “we never doubted you alexandra we never questioned anything you did you’ve always had your own way but you can’t expect us  sit like stumps  see you done out   property  any loafer who happens along  making yourself ridiculous into  bargain” oscar rose “yes”  broke in “everybody’s laughing  see you get took in  your age too everybody knows he’s nearly five years younger than you   after your money why alexandra you  forty years old” “all  doesn’t concern anybody but carl  me go  town  ask your lawyers what you can do  restrain me  disposing  my own property and i advise you  do what they tell you   authority you can exert  law   only influence you  ever have over me again” alexandra rose “i think i would rather not have lived  find out what i have today” she said quietly closing her desk lou  oscar looked  each other questioningly there seemed   nothing  do but  go  they walked out “you can’t do business  women” oscar said heavily   clambered into  cart “but anyhow we’ve had our say  last” lou scratched his head “talk   kind might come too high you know but she’s apt   sensible you hadn’t ought  said  about her age though oscar i’m afraid  hurt her feelings   worst thing we can do   make her sore  us she’d marry him out  contrariness” “i only meant” said oscar “that she  old enough  know better  she is if she  going  marry she ought  done  long ago  not go making  fool  herself now” lou looked anxious nevertheless “of course”  reflected hopefully  inconsistently “alexandra ain’t much like other womenfolks maybe  won’t make her sore maybe she’d  soon  forty  not” xi emil came home  about halfpast seven o’clock  evening old ivar met him   windmill  took his horse   young man went directly into  house he called  his sister  she answered  her bedroom behind  sittingroom saying  she  lying down emil went  her door “can i see you   minute”  asked “i want  talk  you about something before carl comes” alexandra rose quickly  came   door “where  carl” “lou  oscar met us  said they wanted  talk  him so  rode over  oscar’s  them are you coming out” emil asked impatiently “yes sit down i’ll  dressed   moment” alexandra closed her door  emil sank down   old slat lounge  sat  his head  his hands when his sister came out  looked up not knowing whether  interval had been short or long    surprised  see   room had grown quite dark that  just  well  would  easier  talk if   not under  gaze  those clear deliberate eyes  saw so far  some directions   so blind  others alexandra too  glad   dusk her face  swollen  crying emil started up  then sat down again “alexandra”  said slowly  his deep young baritone “i don’t want  go away  law school this fall let me put  off another year i want  take  year off  look around it’s awfully easy  rush into  profession you don’t really like  awfully hard  get out  it linstrum  i have been talking about that” “very well emil only don’t go off looking  land” she came up  put her hand  his shoulder “i’ve been wishing you could stay  me this winter” “that’s just what i don’t want  do alexandra i’m restless i want  go   new place i want  go down   city  mexico  join one   university fellows who’s   head   electrical plant he wrote me  could give me  little job enough  pay my way  i could look around  see what i want  do i want  go  soon  harvest  over i guess lou  oscar   sore about it” “i suppose they will” alexandra sat down   lounge beside him “they  very angry  me emil we have had  quarrel they  not come here again” emil scarcely heard what she  saying  did not notice  sadness  her tone he  thinking about  reckless life  meant  live  mexico “what about”  asked absently “about carl linstrum they  afraid i am going  marry him   some  my property  get away  them” emil shrugged his shoulders “what nonsense”  murmured “just like them” alexandra drew back “why nonsense emil” “why you’ve never thought  such  thing have you they always have  have something  fuss about” “emil” said his sister slowly “you ought not  take things  granted do you agree  them  i have no right  change my way  living” emil looked   outline  his sister’s head   dim light they  sitting close together   somehow felt  she could hear his thoughts he  silent   moment  then said   embarrassed tone “why no certainly not you ought  do whatever you want to i’ll always back you” “but  would seem  little bit ridiculous  you if i married carl” emil fidgeted the issue seemed  him too farfetched  warrant discussion “why no i should  surprised if you wanted to i can’t see exactly why but that’s none  my business you ought  do  you please certainly you ought not  pay any attention  what  boys say” alexandra sighed “i had hoped you might understand  little why i do want to but i suppose that’s too much  expect i’ve had  pretty lonely life emil besides marie carl   only friend i have ever had” emil  awake now  name  her last sentence roused him he put out his hand  took his sister’s awkwardly “you ought  do just  you wish  i think carl’s  fine fellow he  i would always get on i don’t believe any   things  boys say about him honest i don’t they  suspicious  him because he’s intelligent you know their way they’ve been sore  me ever since you let me go away  college they’re always trying  catch me up if i  you i wouldn’t pay any attention  them there’s nothing  get upset about carl’s  sensible fellow he won’t mind them” “i don’t know if they talk  him  way they did  me i think he’ll go away” emil grew more  more uneasy “think so well marie said  would serve us all right if you walked off  him” “did she bless her little heart she would” alexandra’s voice broke emil began unlacing his leggings “why don’t you talk  her about it there’s carl i hear his horse i guess i’ll go upstairs  get my boots off no i don’t want any supper we had supper  five o’clock   fair” emil  glad  escape  get  his own room he   little ashamed  his sister though  had tried not  show it he felt  there  something indecorous  her proposal  she did seem  him somewhat ridiculous there  trouble enough   world  reflected   threw himself upon his bed without people who  forty years old imagining they wanted  get married in  darkness  silence emil  not likely  think long about alexandra every image slipped away but one he had seen marie   crowd  afternoon she sold candy   fair why had she ever run away  frank shabata  how could she go  laughing  working  taking  interest  things why did she like so many people  why had she seemed pleased when all  french  bohemian boys   priest himself crowded round her candy stand why did she care about any one but him why could  never never find  thing  looked   her playful affectionate eyes then  fell  imagining   looked once more  found  there  what  would  like if she loved him—she who  alexandra said could give her whole heart in  dream  could lie  hours  if   trance his spirit went out  his body  crossed  fields  marie shabata at  university dances  girls had often looked wonderingly   tall young swede   fine head leaning against  wall  frowning his arms folded his eyes fixed   ceiling or  floor all  girls   little afraid  him he  distinguishedlooking  not  jollying kind they felt    too intense  preoccupied there  something queer about him emil’s fraternity rather prided itself upon  dances  sometimes  did his duty  danced every dance but whether     floor or brooding   corner   always thinking about marie shabata for two years  storm had been gathering  him xii carl came into  sittingroom while alexandra  lighting  lamp she looked up  him  she adjusted  shade his sharp shoulders stooped  if   very tired his face  pale  there  bluish shadows under his dark eyes his anger had burned itself out  left him sick  disgusted “you have seen lou  oscar” alexandra asked “yes” his eyes avoided hers alexandra took  deep breath “and now you  going away i thought so” carl threw himself into  chair  pushed  dark lock back  his forehead  his white nervous hand “what  hopeless position you  in alexandra”  exclaimed feverishly “it  your fate   always surrounded  little men and i am no better than  rest i am too little  face  criticism  even such men  lou  oscar yes i am going away tomorrow i cannot even ask you  give me  promise until i have something  offer you i thought perhaps i could do that but i find i can’t” “what good comes  offering people things they don’t need” alexandra asked sadly “i don’t need money but i have needed you   great many years i wonder why i have been permitted  prosper if   only  take my friends away  me” “i don’t deceive myself” carl said frankly “i know  i am going away  my own account i must make  usual effort i must have something  show  myself to take what you would give me i should have   either  very large man or  very small one  i am only   middle class” alexandra sighed “i have  feeling  if you go away you  not come back something  happen  one  us or  both people have  snatch  happiness when they can  this world it  always easier  lose than  find what i have  yours if you care enough about me  take it” carl rose  looked up   picture  john bergson “but i can’t my dear i can’t i  go north  once instead  idling about  california all winter i shall  getting my bearings up there i won’t waste another week be patient  me alexandra give me  year” “as you will” said alexandra wearily “all  once   single day i lose everything  i do not know why emil too  going away” carl  still studying john bergson’s face  alexandra’s eyes followed his “yes” she said “if  could have seen all  would come   task  gave me  would have been sorry i hope  does not see me now i hope    among  old people  his blood  country   tidings do not reach him   new world” part iii winter memories i winter  settled

i’d have run over  see  myself if you get downhearted what  become   rest  us” alexandra asked “i don’t very often there’s mrs lee without any coffee” later when mrs lee declared  her powers  spent marie  alexandra went upstairs  look  some crochet patterns  old lady wanted  borrow “better put  your coat alexandra it’s cold up there  i have no idea where those patterns are i may have  look through my old trunks” marie caught up  shawl  opened  stair door running up  steps ahead  her guest “while i go through  bureau drawers you might look  those hatboxes   closetshelf over where frank’s clothes hang there   lot  odds  ends  them” she began tossing over  contents   drawers  alexandra went into  clothescloset presently she came back holding  slender elastic yellow stick  her hand “what   world  this marie you don’t mean  tell me frank ever carried such  thing” marie blinked    astonishment  sat down   floor “where did you find it i didn’t know  had kept it i haven’t seen   years” “it really   cane then” “yes one  brought   old country he used  carry  when i first knew him isn’t  foolish poor frank” alexandra twirled  stick  her fingers  laughed “he must have looked funny” marie  thoughtful “no  didn’t really it didn’t seem out  place he used   awfully gay like  when    young man i guess people always get what’s hardest  them alexandra” marie gathered  shawl closer about her  still looked hard   cane “frank would  all right   right place” she said reflectively “he ought  have  different kind  wife  one thing do you know alexandra i could pick out exactly  right sort  woman  frank—now the trouble  you almost have  marry  man before you can find out  sort  wife  needs  usually it’s exactly  sort you  not then what  you going  do about it” she asked candidly alexandra confessed she didn’t know “however” she added “it seems  me  you get along  frank about  well  any woman i’ve ever seen or heard  could” marie shook her head pursing her lips  blowing her warm breath softly out into  frosty air “no i  spoiled  home i like my own way  i have  quick tongue when frank brags i say sharp things   never forgets he goes over  over   his mind i can feel him then i’m too giddy frank’s wife ought   timid  she ought not  care about another living thing   world but just frank i didn’t when i married him but i suppose i  too young  stay like that” marie sighed alexandra had never heard marie speak so frankly about her husband before  she felt    wiser not  encourage her no good she reasoned ever came  talking about such things  while marie  thinking aloud alexandra had been steadily searching  hatboxes “aren’t these  patterns maria” maria sprang up   floor “sure enough we  looking  patterns weren’t we i’d forgot about everything but frank’s other wife i’ll put  away” she poked  cane behind frank’s sunday clothes  though she laughed alexandra saw there  tears  her eyes when they went back   kitchen  snow had begun  fall  marie’s visitors thought they must  getting home she went out   cart  them  tucked  robes about old mrs lee while alexandra took  blanket off her horse as they drove away marie turned  went slowly back   house she took up  package  letters alexandra had brought but she did not read them she turned them over  looked   foreign stamps  then sat watching  flying snow while  dusk deepened   kitchen   stove sent out  red glow marie knew perfectly well  emil’s letters  written more  her than  alexandra they  not  sort  letters   young man writes  his sister they  both more personal  more painstaking full  descriptions   gay life   old mexican capital   days when  strong hand  porfirio diaz  still strong he told about bullfights  cockfights churches  fiestas  flowermarkets   fountains  music  dancing  people  all nations  met   italian restaurants  san francisco street in short they   kind  letters  young man writes   woman when  wishes himself  his life  seem interesting  her when  wishes  enlist her imagination  his behalf marie when she  alone or when she sat sewing   evening often thought about what  must  like down there where emil was where there  flowers  street bands everywhere  carriages rattling up  down  where there   little blind bootblack  front   cathedral who could play any tune you asked   dropping  lids  blackingboxes   stone steps when everything  done  over  one  twentythree   pleasant  let  mind wander forth  follow  young adventurer who  life before him “and if  had not been  me” she thought “frank might still  free like that  having  good time making people admire him poor frank getting married wasn’t very good  him either i’m afraid i do set people against him   says i seem somehow  give him away all  time perhaps  would try   agreeable  people again if i  not around it seems  if i always make him just  bad   can be” later   winter alexandra looked back upon  afternoon   last satisfactory visit she had had  marie after  day  younger woman seemed  shrink more  more into herself when she   alexandra she  not spontaneous  frank  she used  be she seemed   brooding over something  holding something back the weather had  good deal  do  their seeing less  each other than usual there had not been such snowstorms  twenty years   path across  fields  drifted deep  christmas until march when  two neighbors went  see each other they had  go round   wagonroad which  twice  far they telephoned each other almost every night though  january there   stretch  three weeks when  wires  down  when  postman did not come  all marie often ran   see her nearest neighbor old mrs hiller who  crippled  rheumatism  had only her son  lame shoemaker  take care  her  she went   french church whatever  weather she   sincerely devout girl she prayed  herself   frank   emil among  temptations   gay corrupt old city she found more comfort   church  winter than ever before it seemed  come closer  her   fill  emptiness  ached  her heart she tried   patient  her husband he  his hired man usually played california jack   evening marie sat sewing or crocheting  tried  take  friendly interest   game but she  always thinking about  wide fields outside where  snow  drifting over  fences  about  orchard where  snow  falling  packing crust over crust when she went out into  dark kitchen  fix her plants   night she used  stand   window  look out   white fields or watch  currents  snow whirling over  orchard she seemed  feel  weight  all  snow  lay down there the branches had become so hard  they wounded your hand if you but tried  break  twig and yet down under  frozen crusts   roots   trees  secret  life  still safe warm   blood  one’s heart   spring would come again oh  would come again ii if alexandra had had much imagination she might have guessed what  going   marie’s mind  she would have seen long before what  going   emil’s but that  emil himself had more than once reflected  alexandra’s blind side  her life had not been   kind  sharpen her vision her training had all been toward  end  making her proficient  what she had undertaken  do her personal life her own realization  herself  almost  subconscious existence like  underground river  came   surface only here  there  intervals months apart  then sank again  flow  under her own fields nevertheless  underground stream  there    because she had so much personality  put into her enterprises  succeeded  putting  into them so completely  her affairs prospered better than those  her neighbors there  certain days  her life outwardly uneventful which alexandra remembered  peculiarly happy days when she  close   flat fallow world about her  felt   were  her own body  joyous germination   soil there  days too which she  emil had spent together upon which she loved  look back there had been such  day when they  down   river   dry year looking over  land they had made  early start one morning  had driven  long way before noon when emil said   hungry they drew back   road gave brigham his oats among  bushes  climbed up   top   grassy bluff  eat their lunch under  shade  some little elm trees the river  clear there  shallow since there had been no rain   ran  ripples over  sparkling sand under  overhanging willows   opposite bank there   inlet where  water  deeper  flowed so slowly   seemed  sleep   sun in this little bay  single wild duck  swimming  diving  preening her feathers disporting herself very happily   flickering light  shade they sat   long time watching  solitary bird take  pleasure no living thing had ever seemed  alexandra  beautiful   wild duck emil must have felt about   she did  afterward when they   home  used sometimes  say “sister you know our duck down there—” alexandra remembered  day  one   happiest  her life years afterward she thought   duck  still there swimming  diving all  herself   sunlight  kind  enchanted bird  did not know age or change most  alexandra’s happy memories   impersonal  this one yet  her they  very personal her mind   white book  clear writing about weather  beasts  growing things not many people would have cared  read it only  happy few she had never been  love she had never indulged  sentimental reveries even   girl she had looked upon men  workfellows she had grown up  serious times there  one fancy indeed which persisted through her girlhood it most often came  her  sunday mornings  one day   week when she lay late abed listening   familiar morning sounds  windmill singing   brisk breeze emil whistling   blacked his boots down   kitchen door sometimes  she lay thus luxuriously idle her eyes closed she used  have  illusion  being lifted up bodily  carried lightly  some one very strong it   man certainly who carried her but   like no man she knew   much larger  stronger  swifter   carried her  easily  if she   sheaf  wheat she never saw him but  eyes closed she could feel    yellow like  sunlight  there   smell  ripe cornfields about him she could feel him approach bend over her  lift her  then she could feel herself being carried swiftly off across  fields after such  reverie she would rise hastily angry  herself  go down   bathhouse   partitioned off  kitchen shed there she would stand   tin tub  prosecute her bath  vigor finishing   pouring buckets  cold wellwater over her gleaming white body which no man   divide could have carried very far as she grew older this fancy more often came  her when she  tired than when she  fresh  strong sometimes after she had been   open all day overseeing  branding   cattle or  loading   pigs she would come  chilled take  concoction  spices  warm homemade wine  go  bed  her body actually aching  fatigue then just before she went  sleep she had  old sensation  being lifted  carried   strong being who took  her all her bodily weariness part iv the white mulberry tree i the french church properly  church  sainteagnes stood upon  hill the high narrow redbrick building   tall steeple

difference whether   me or raoul marcel or jan smirka are you really like that” “perhaps i am what do you want me  do sit round  cry all day when i’ve cried until i can’t cry any more then—then i must do something else” “are you sorry  me”  persisted “no i’m not if i  big  free like you i wouldn’t let anything make me unhappy as old napoleon brunot said   fair i wouldn’t go lovering after no woman i’d take  first train  go off  have all  fun there is” “i tried that but  didn’t do any good everything reminded me the nicer  place was  more i wanted you” they had come   stile  emil pointed   persuasively “sit down  moment i want  ask you something” marie sat down   top step  emil drew nearer “would you tell me something that’s none  my business if you thought  would help me out well then tell me please tell me why you ran away  frank shabata” marie drew back “because i   love  him” she said firmly “really”  asked incredulously “yes indeed very much  love  him i think i   one who suggested our running away from  first   more my fault than his” emil turned away his face “and now” marie went on “i’ve got  remember that frank  just  same now    then only then i would see him  i wanted him  be i would have my own way and now i pay  it” “you don’t do all  paying” “that’s it when one makes  mistake there’s no telling where   stop but you can go away you can leave all this behind you” “not everything i can’t leave you behind will you go away  me marie” marie started up  stepped across  stile “emil how wickedly you talk i am not  kind   girl  you know it but what am i going  do if you keep tormenting me like this” she added plaintively “marie i won’t bother you any more if you  tell me just one thing stop  minute  look  me no nobody can see us everybody’s asleep that  only  firefly marie stop  tell me” emil overtook her  catching her   shoulders shook her gently  if   trying  awaken  sleepwalker marie hid her face  his arm “don’t ask me anything more i don’t know anything except how miserable i am and i thought  would  all right when you came back oh emil” she clutched his sleeve  began  cry “what am i  do if you don’t go away i can’t go  one  us must can’t you see” emil stood looking down  her holding his shoulders stiff  stiffening  arm  which she clung her white dress looked gray   darkness she seemed like  troubled spirit like some shadow out   earth clinging  him  entreating him  give her peace behind her  fireflies  weaving   out over  wheat he put his hand  her bent head “on my honor marie if you  say you love me i  go away” she lifted her face  his “how could i help it didn’t you know” emil   one who trembled through all his frame after  left marie  her gate  wandered about  fields all night till morning put out  fireflies   stars iii one evening  week after signa’s wedding emil  kneeling before  box   sittingroom packing his books from time  time  rose  wandered about  house picking up stray volumes  bringing them listlessly back  his box he  packing without enthusiasm he  not very sanguine about his future alexandra sat sewing   table she had helped him pack his trunk   afternoon as emil came  went  her chair  his books  thought  himself   had not been so hard  leave his sister since  first went away  school he  going directly  omaha  read law   office   swedish lawyer until october when  would enter  law school  ann arbor they had planned  alexandra   come  michigan—a long journey  her—at christmas time  spend several weeks  him nevertheless  felt  this leavetaking would  more final than his earlier ones had been   meant  definite break  his old home   beginning  something new—he did not know what his ideas about  future would not crystallize  more  tried  think about it  vaguer his conception   became but one thing  clear  told himself   high time   made good  alexandra   ought   incentive enough  begin with as  went about gathering up his books  felt  if   uprooting things at last  threw himself down   old slat lounge where  had slept when   little  lay looking up   familiar cracks   ceiling “tired emil” his sister asked “lazy”  murmured turning  his side  looking  her he studied alexandra’s face   long time   lamplight it had never occurred  him  his sister   handsome woman until marie shabata had told him so indeed  had never thought  her  being  woman  all only  sister as  studied her bent head  looked up   picture  john bergson above  lamp “no”  thought  himself “she didn’t get  there i suppose i am more like that” “alexandra”  said suddenly “that old walnut secretary you use   desk  father’s wasn’t it” alexandra went  stitching “yes it  one   first things  bought   old log house it   great extravagance  those days but  wrote  great many letters back   old country he had many friends there  they wrote  him up   time  died no one ever blamed him  grandfather’s disgrace i can see him now sitting there  sundays  his white shirt writing pages  pages so carefully he wrote  fine regular hand almost like engraving yours  something like his when you take pains” “grandfather  really crooked  he” “he married  unscrupulous woman  then—then i’m afraid   really crooked when we first came here father used  have dreams about making  great fortune  going back  sweden  pay back   poor sailors  money grandfather had lost” emil stirred   lounge “i say  would have been worth while wouldn’t it father wasn’t  bit like lou or oscar  he i can’t remember much about him before  got sick” “oh not  all” alexandra dropped her sewing  her knee “he had better opportunities not  make money but  make something  himself he   quiet man but   very intelligent you would have been proud  him emil” alexandra felt   would like  know there had been  man  his kin whom  could admire she knew  emil  ashamed  lou  oscar because they  bigoted  selfsatisfied he never said much about them but she could feel his disgust his brothers had shown their disapproval  him ever since  first went away  school the only thing  would have satisfied them would have been his failure   university as  was they resented every change  his speech  his dress  his point  view though  latter they had  conjecture  emil avoided talking  them about any but family matters all his interests they treated  affectations alexandra took up her sewing again “i can remember father when   quite  young man he belonged  some kind   musical society  male chorus  stockholm i can remember going  mother  hear them sing there must have been  hundred  them  they all wore long black coats  white neckties i  used  seeing father   blue coat  sort  jacket  when i recognized him   platform i  very proud do you remember  swedish song  taught you about  ship boy” “yes i used  sing    mexicans they like anything different” emil paused “father had  hard fight here didn’t he”  added thoughtfully “yes   died   dark time still  had hope he believed   land” “and  you i guess” emil said  himself there  another period  silence  warm friendly silence full  perfect understanding  which emil  alexandra had spent many  their happiest halfhours at last emil said abruptly “lou  oscar would  better off if they  poor wouldn’t they” alexandra smiled “maybe but their children wouldn’t i have great hopes  milly” emil shivered “i don’t know seems  me  gets worse   goes on the worst   swedes   they’re never willing  find out how much they don’t know it  like    university always so pleased  themselves there’s no getting behind  conceited swedish grin the bohemians  germans  so different” “come emil don’t go back  your own people father wasn’t conceited uncle otto wasn’t even lou  oscar weren’t when they  boys” emil looked incredulous but  did not dispute  point he turned  his back  lay still   long time his hands locked under his head looking up   ceiling alexandra knew    thinking  many things she felt no anxiety about emil she had always believed  him  she had believed   land he had been more like himself since  got back  mexico seemed glad    home  talked  her   used  do she had no doubt  his wandering fit  over    would soon  settled  life “alexandra” said emil suddenly “do you remember  wild duck we saw down   river  time” his sister looked up “i often think  her it always seems  me she’s there still just like we saw her” “i know it’s queer what things one remembers  what things one forgets” emil yawned  sat up “well it’s time  turn in” he rose  going over  alexandra stooped down  kissed her lightly   cheek “goodnight sister i think you did pretty well  us” emil took up his lamp  went upstairs alexandra sat finishing his new nightshirt  must go   top tray  his trunk iv the next morning angélique amédée’s wife    kitchen baking pies assisted  old mrs chevalier between  mixingboard   stove stood  old cradle  had been amédée’s     his blackeyed son as angélique flushed  excited  flour  her hands stopped  smile   baby emil bergson rode up   kitchen door  his mare  dismounted “’médée  out   field emil” angélique called  she ran across  kitchen   oven “he begins  cut his wheat today  first wheat ready  cut anywhere about here he bought  new header you know because all  wheat’s so short this year i hope  can rent    neighbors  cost so much he  his cousins bought  steam thresher  shares you ought  go out  see  header work i watched   hour this morning busy  i am  all  men  feed he   lot  hands but he’s  only one  knows how  drive  header or how  run  engine so     everywhere  once he’s sick too  ought    his bed” emil bent over hector baptiste trying  make him blink his round beadlike black eyes “sick what’s  matter  your daddy kid been making him walk  floor  you” angélique sniffed “not much we don’t have  kind  babies it  his father  kept baptiste awake all night i had   getting up  making mustard plasters  put  his stomach he had  awful colic he said  felt better this morning but i don’t think  ought   out   field overheating himself” angélique did not speak  much anxiety not because she  indifferent but because she felt so secure  their good fortune only good things could happen   rich energetic handsome young man like amédée   new baby   cradle   new header   field emil stroked  black fuzz  baptiste’s head “i say angélique one  ’médée’s grandmothers ’way back must have been  squaw this kid looks exactly like  indian babies” angélique made  face  him but old mrs chevalier had been touched   sore point  she let out such  stream  fiery patois  emil fled   kitchen  mounted his mare opening  pasture gate   saddle emil rode across  field   clearing where  thresher stood driven   stationary engine  fed   header boxes as amédée  not   engine emil rode    wheatfield where  recognized   header  slight wiry figure  his friend coatless his white shirt puffed out   wind his straw hat stuck jauntily   side  his head the six big workhorses  drew or rather pushed  header went abreast   rapid walk   they  still green   work they required  good deal  management  amédée’s part especially when they turned  corners where they divided three  three  then swung round into line again   movement  looked  complicated   wheel  artillery emil felt  new thrill  admiration  his friend     old pang  envy   way  which amédée could do  his might what his hand found  do  feel that whatever  was    most important thing   world “i’ll have  bring alexandra up  see this thing work” emil thought “it’s splendid” when  saw emil amédée waved  him  called  one  his twenty cousins  take  reins stepping off  header without stopping it  ran up  emil who had dismounted “come along”  called “i have  go over   engine   minute i gotta green man running it  i gotta  keep  eye  him” emil thought  lad  unnaturally flushed  more excited than even  cares  managing  big farm   critical time warranted as they passed behind  last year’s stack amédée clutched  his right side  sank down   moment   straw “ouch i got  awful pain  me emil something’s  matter  my insides  sure” emil felt his fiery cheek “you ought  go straight  bed ’médée  telephone   doctor that’s what you ought  do” amédée staggered up   gesture  despair “how can i i got no time   sick three thousand dollars’ worth  new machinery  manage   wheat so ripe   begin  shatter next week my wheat’s short but it’s gotta grand full berries what’s  slowing down for we haven’t got header boxes enough  feed  thresher i guess” amédée started hotfoot across  stubble leaning  little   right   ran  waved   engineer not  stop  engine emil saw  this  no time  talk about his own affairs he mounted his mare  rode   sainteagnes  bid his friends there goodbye he went first  see raoul marcel  found him innocently practising  “gloria”   big confirmation service  sunday while  polished  mirrors  his father’s saloon as emil rode homewards  three o’clock   afternoon  saw amédée staggering out   wheatfield supported  two  his cousins emil stopped  helped them put  boy  bed v when frank shabata came   work  five o’clock  evening old moses marcel raoul’s father telephoned him  amédée had had  seizure   wheatfield   doctor paradis  going  operate  him  soon   hanover doctor got there  help frank dropped  word  this   table bolted his supper  rode off  sainteagnes where there would  sympathetic discussion  amédée’s case  marcel’s saloon as soon  frank  gone marie telephoned alexandra it   comfort  hear her friend’s voice yes alexandra knew what there    known about amédée emil had been there when they carried him out   field  had stayed  him until  doctors operated  appendicitis  five o’clock they  afraid   too late  do much good  should have been done three days ago amédée    very bad way emil had just come home worn out  sick himself she had given him some brandy  put him  bed marie hung up  receiver poor amédée’s illness had taken   new meaning  her now  she knew emil had been  him and  might so easily have been  other way—emil who  ill  amédée who  sad marie looked about  dusky sittingroom she had seldom felt so utterly lonely if emil  asleep there  not even  chance  his coming  she could not go  alexandra  sympathy she meant  tell alexandra everything  soon  emil went away then whatever  left between them would  honest but she could not stay   house this evening where should she go she walked slowly down through  orchard where  evening air  heavy   smell  wild cotton the fresh salty scent   wild roses had given way before this more powerful perfume  midsummer wherever those ashesofrose balls hung  their milky stalks  air about them  saturated  their breath the sky  still red   west   evening star hung directly over  bergsons’ windmill marie crossed  fence   wheatfield corner  walked slowly along  path  led  alexandra’s she could not help feeling hurt  emil had not come  tell her about amédée it seemed  her most unnatural   should not have come if she   trouble certainly    one person   world she would want  see perhaps  wished her  understand   her    good  gone already marie stole slowly flutteringly along  path like  white nightmoth out   fields the years seemed  stretch before her like  land spring summer autumn winter spring always  same patient fields  patient little trees  patient lives always  same yearning  same pulling   chain—until  instinct  live had torn itself  bled  weakened   last time until  chain secured  dead woman who might cautiously  released marie walked on her face lifted toward  remote inaccessible evening star when she reached  stile she sat down  waited how terrible    love people when you could not really share their lives yes  so far  she  concerned emil  already gone they couldn’t meet any more there  nothing  them  say they had spent  last penny  their small change there  nothing left but gold the day  lovetokens  past they had now only their hearts  give each other and emil being gone what  her life   like in some ways  would  easier she would not  least live  perpetual fear if emil  once away  settled  work she would not have  feeling  she  spoiling his life with  memory  left her she could   rash  she chose nobody could   worse   but herself  that surely did not matter her own case  clear when  girl had loved one man  then loved another while  man  still alive everybody knew what  think  her what happened  her   little consequence so long  she did not drag other people down  her emil once away she could let everything else go  live  new life  perfect love marie left  stile reluctantly she had after all thought  might come and how glad she ought  be she told herself    asleep she left  path  went across  pasture the moon  almost full an owl  hooting somewhere   fields she had scarcely thought about where she  going when  pond glittered before her where emil had shot  ducks she stopped  looked  it yes there would   dirty way out  life if one chose  take it but she did not want  die she wanted  live  dream—a hundred years forever as long  this sweetness welled up  her heart  long  her breast could hold this treasure  pain she felt   pond must feel when  held  moon like that when  encircled  swelled   image  gold in  morning when emil came downstairs alexandra met him   sittingroom  put her hands  his shoulders “emil i went  your room  soon    light but you  sleeping so sound i hated  wake you there  nothing you could do so i let you sleep they telephoned

could stand  no longer he slipped out under cover  “the holy city” followed  malvina’s wistful eye  went   stable  his mare he    height  excitement  which everything  foreshortened  which life seems short  simple death very near   soul seems  soar like  eagle as  rode past  graveyard  looked   brown hole   earth where amédée   lie  felt no horror that too  beautiful  simple doorway into forgetfulness the heart when   too much alive aches   brown earth  ecstasy  no fear  death it   old   poor   maimed who shrink   brown hole  wooers  found among  young  passionate  gallanthearted it  not until  had passed  graveyard  emil realized where   going it   hour  saying goodbye it might   last time   would see her alone  today  could leave her without rancor without bitterness everywhere  grain stood ripe   hot afternoon  full   smell   ripe wheat like  smell  bread baking   oven the breath   wheat   sweet clover passed him like pleasant things   dream he could feel nothing but  sense  diminishing distance it seemed  him  his mare  flying or running  wheels like  railway train the sunlight flashing   windowglass   big red barns drove him wild  joy he  like  arrow shot   bow his life poured itself out along  road before him   rode   shabata farm when emil alighted   shabatas’ gate his horse    lather he tied her   stable  hurried   house it  empty she might   mrs hiller’s or  alexandra but anything  reminded him  her would  enough  orchard  mulberry tree when  reached  orchard  sun  hanging low over  wheatfield long fingers  light reached through  apple branches  through  net  orchard  riddled  shot  gold light   reality  trees  merely interferences  reflected  refracted light emil went softly down between  cherry trees toward  wheatfield when  came   corner  stopped short  put his hand over his mouth marie  lying  her side under  white mulberry tree her face half hidden   grass her eyes closed her hands lying limply where they had happened  fall she had lived  day  her new life  perfect love   had left her like this her breast rose  fell faintly  if she  asleep emil threw himself down beside her  took her  his arms the blood came back  her cheeks her amber eyes opened slowly   them emil saw his own face   orchard   sun “i  dreaming this” she whispered hiding her face against him “don’t take my dream away” vii when frank shabata got home  night  found emil’s mare  his stable such  impertinence amazed him like everybody else frank had had  exciting day since noon  had been drinking too much      bad temper he talked bitterly  himself while  put his own horse away    went up  path  saw   house  dark  felt  added sense  injury he approached quietly  listened   doorstep hearing nothing  opened  kitchen door  went softly  one room  another then  went through  house again upstairs  down  no better result he sat down   bottom step   box stairway  tried  get his wits together in  unnatural quiet there  no sound but his own heavy breathing suddenly  owl began  hoot out   fields frank lifted his head an idea flashed into his mind  his sense  injury  outrage grew he went into his bedroom  took his murderous  winchester   closet when frank took up his gun  walked out   house  had not  faintest purpose  doing anything  it he did not believe   had any real grievance but  gratified him  feel like  desperate man he had got into  habit  seeing himself always  desperate straits his unhappy temperament  like  cage  could never get out  it   felt  other people his wife  particular must have put him there it had never more than dimly occurred  frank   made his own unhappiness though  took up his gun  dark projects  his mind  would have been paralyzed  fright had  known  there   slightest probability  his ever carrying any  them out frank went slowly down   orchard gate stopped  stood   moment lost  thought he retraced his steps  looked through  barn   hayloft then  went out   road where  took  footpath along  outside   orchard hedge the hedge  twice  tall  frank himself  so dense  one could see through  only  peering closely between  leaves he could see  empty path  long way   moonlight his mind traveled ahead   stile which  always thought   haunted  emil bergson but why had  left his horse at  wheatfield corner where  orchard hedge ended   path led across  pasture   bergsons’ frank stopped in  warm breathless night air  heard  murmuring sound perfectly inarticulate  low   sound  water coming   spring where there  no fall  where there  no stones  fret it frank strained his ears it ceased he held his breath  began  tremble resting  butt  his gun   ground  parted  mulberry leaves softly  his fingers  peered through  hedge   dark figures   grass   shadow   mulberry tree it seemed  him  they must feel his eyes  they must hear him breathing but they did not frank who had always wanted  see things blacker than they were  once wanted  believe less than  saw the woman lying   shadow might so easily  one   bergsons’ farmgirls again  murmur like water welling out   ground this time  heard  more distinctly  his blood  quicker than his brain he began  act just   man who falls into  fire begins  act the gun sprang  his shoulder  sighted mechanically  fired three times without stopping stopped without knowing why either  shut his eyes or  had vertigo he did not see anything while   firing he thought  heard  cry simultaneous   second report but   not sure he peered again through  hedge   two dark figures under  tree they had fallen  little apart  each other   perfectly still—no not quite   white patch  light where  moon shone through  branches  man’s hand  plucking spasmodically   grass suddenly  woman stirred  uttered  cry then another  another she  living she  dragging herself toward  hedge frank dropped his gun  ran back along  path shaking stumbling gasping he had never imagined such horror the cries followed him they grew fainter  thicker  if she  choking he dropped  his knees beside  hedge  crouched like  rabbit listening fainter fainter  sound like  whine again—a moan—another—silence frank scrambled  his feet  ran on groaning  praying from habit  went toward  house where   used  being soothed when  had worked himself into  frenzy but   sight   black open door  started back he knew   had murdered somebody   woman  bleeding  moaning   orchard but  had not realized before    his wife the gate stared him   face he threw his hands over his head which way  turn he lifted his tormented face  looked   sky “holy mother  god not  suffer she   good girl—not  suffer” frank had been wont  see himself  dramatic situations but now when  stood   windmill   bright space between  barn   house facing his own black doorway  did not see himself  all he stood like  hare when  dogs  approaching  all sides and  ran like  hare back  forth about  moonlit space before  could make up his mind  go into  dark stable   horse the thought  going into  doorway  terrible  him he caught emil’s horse   bit  led  out he could not have buckled  bridle  his own after two or three attempts  lifted himself into  saddle  started  hanover if  could catch  one o’clock train  had money enough  get  far  omaha while   thinking dully  this  some less sensitized part  his brain his acuter faculties  going over  over  cries  had heard   orchard terror   only thing  kept him  going back  her terror  she might still  she  she might still  suffering a woman mutilated  bleeding  his orchard—it  because    woman    so afraid it  inconceivable   should have hurt  woman he would rather  eaten  wild beasts than see her move   ground  she had moved   orchard why had she been so careless she knew   like  crazy man when   angry she had more than once taken  gun away  him  held it when   angry  other people once  had gone off while they  struggling over it she  never afraid but when she knew him why hadn’t she been more careful didn’t she have all summer before her  love emil bergson in without taking such chances probably she had met  smirka boy too down there   orchard he didn’t care she could have met all  men   divide there  welcome if only she hadn’t brought this horror  him there   wrench  frank’s mind he did not honestly believe   her he knew    doing her wrong he stopped his horse  admit this  himself  more directly  think  out  more clearly he knew

covered  dark stains where she had kissed it but  stained slippery grass  darkened mulberries told only half  story above marie  emil two white butterflies  frank’s alfalfafield  fluttering   out among  interlacing shadows diving  soaring now close together now far apart    long grass   fence  last wild roses   year opened their pink hearts  die when ivar reached  path   hedge  saw shabata’s rifle lying   way he turned  peered through  branches falling upon his knees  if his legs had been mowed  under him “merciful god”  groaned alexandra too had risen early  morning because  her anxiety about emil she   emil’s room upstairs when   window she saw ivar coming along  path  led   shabatas’ he  running like  spent man tottering  lurching  side  side ivar never drank  alexandra thought

bravely   soft ground slipping back again  again  she climbed  hill   main road between  rain   darkness ivar could see very little so  let emil’s mare have  rein keeping her head   right direction when  ground  level  turned her out   dirt road upon  sod where she  able  trot without slipping before ivar reached  graveyard three miles   house  storm had spent itself   downpour had died into  soft dripping rain the sky   land   dark smoke color  seemed   coming together like two waves when ivar stopped   gate  swung out his lantern  white figure rose  beside john bergson’s white stone the old man sprang   ground  shuffled toward  gate calling “mistress mistress” alexandra hurried  meet him  put her hand  his shoulder “tyst ivar there’s nothing   worried about i’m sorry if i’ve scared you all i didn’t notice  storm till    me  i couldn’t walk against it i’m glad you’ve come i am so tired i didn’t know how i’d ever get home” ivar swung  lantern up so   shone  her face “gud you  enough  frighten us mistress you look like  drowned woman how could you do such  thing” groaning  mumbling  led her out   gate  helped her into  cart wrapping her   dry blankets  which  had been

her feet sent back  continual spatter  mud alexandra spoke   old man  they jogged along through  sullen gray twilight   storm “ivar i think   done me good  get cold clear through like this once i don’t believe i shall suffer so much any more when you get so near  dead they seem more real than  living worldly thoughts leave one ever since emil died i’ve suffered so when  rained now  i’ve been

can’t see things but they come  you somehow  you know them  aren’t afraid  them maybe it’s like    dead if they feel anything  all it’s  old things before they  born  comfort people like  feeling  their own bed does when they  little” “mistress” said ivar reproachfully “those  bad thoughts the dead   paradise” then  hung his head   did not believe  emil   paradise when they got home signa had  fire burning   sittingroom stove she undressed alexandra  gave her  hot footbath while ivar made ginger tea   kitchen when alexandra   bed wrapped  hot blankets ivar came   his tea  saw  she drank it signa asked permission  sleep   slat lounge outside her door alexandra endured their attentions patiently but she  glad when they put out  lamp  left her as she lay alone   dark  occurred  her   first time  perhaps she  actually tired  life all  physical operations  life seemed difficult  painful she longed   free  her own body which ached   so heavy and longing itself  heavy she yearned   free  that as she lay  her eyes closed she had again more vividly than  many years  old illusion  her girlhood  being lifted  carried lightly  some one very strong he   her  long while this time  carried her very far   his arms she felt free  pain when  laid her down  her bed again she opened her eyes and   first time  her life she saw him saw him clearly though  room  dark  his face  covered he  standing   doorway  her room his white cloak  thrown over his face  his head  bent  little forward his shoulders seemed  strong   foundations   world his right arm bared   elbow  dark  gleaming like bronze  she knew  once     arm   mightiest  all lovers she knew  last  whom   she had waited  where  would carry her that she told herself  very well then she went  sleep alexandra wakened   morning  nothing worse than  hard cold   stiff shoulder she kept her bed  several days    during  time  she formed  resolution  go  lincoln  see frank shabata ever since she last saw him   courtroom frank’s haggard face  wild eyes had haunted her the trial had lasted only three days frank had given himself up   police  omaha  pleaded guilty  killing without malice  without premeditation the gun was  course against him   judge had given him  full sentence—ten years he had now been   state penitentiary   month frank   only one alexandra told herself  whom anything could  done he had been less   wrong than any  them    paying  heaviest penalty she often felt  she herself had been more  blame than poor frank from  time  shabatas had first moved   neighboring farm she had omitted no opportunity  throwing marie  emil together because she knew frank  surly about doing little things  help his wife she  always sending emil over  spade or plant or carpenter  marie she  glad  have emil see  much  possible   intelligent citybred girl like their neighbor she noticed   improved his manners she knew  emil  fond  marie but  had never occurred  her  emil’s feeling might  different  her own she wondered  herself now but she had never thought  danger   direction if marie had been unmarried—oh yes then she would have kept her eyes open but  mere fact  she  shabata’s wife  alexandra settled everything that she  beautiful impulsive barely two years older than emil these facts had had no weight  alexandra emil   good boy  only bad boys ran after married women now alexandra could   measure realize  marie was after all marie not merely  “married woman” sometimes when alexandra thought  her     aching tenderness the moment she had reached them   orchard  morning everything  clear  her there  something about those two lying   grass something   way marie had settled her cheek  emil’s shoulder  told her everything she wondered then how they could have helped loving each other how she could have helped knowing  they must emil’s cold frowning face  girl’s content—alexandra had felt awe  them even   first shock  her grief the idleness  those days  bed  relaxation  body which attended them enabled alexandra  think more calmly than she had done since emil’s death she  frank she told herself  left out   group  friends who had been overwhelmed  disaster she must certainly see frank shabata even   courtroom her heart had grieved  him he    strange country  had no kinsmen or friends    moment  had ruined his life being what  was she felt frank could not have acted otherwise she could understand his behavior more easily than she could understand marie’s yes she must go  lincoln  see frank shabata the day after emil’s funeral alexandra had written  carl linstrum  single page  notepaper  bare statement  what had happened she  not  woman who could write much about such  thing  about her own feelings she could never write very freely she knew  carl  away  postoffices prospecting somewhere   interior before  started  had written her where  expected  go but her ideas about alaska  vague as  weeks went   she heard nothing  him  seemed  alexandra  her heart grew hard against carl she began  wonder whether she would not do better  finish her life alone what  left  life seemed unimportant ii late   afternoon   brilliant october day alexandra bergson dressed   black suit  travelinghat alighted   burlington depot  lincoln she drove   lindell hotel where she had stayed two years ago when she came up  emil’s commencement in spite  her usual air  sureness  selfpossession alexandra felt ill  ease  hotels  she  glad when she went   clerk’s desk  register  there  not many people   lobby she had her supper early wearing her hat  black jacket down   diningroom  carrying her handbag after supper she went out   walk it  growing dark when she reached  university campus she did not go into  grounds but walked slowly up  down  stone walk outside  long iron fence looking through   young men who  running  one building  another   lights shining   armory   library a squad  cadets  going through their drill behind  armory   commands  their young officer rang out  regular intervals so sharp  quick  alexandra could not understand them two stalwart girls came down  library steps  out through one   iron gates as they passed her alexandra  pleased  hear them speaking bohemian  each other every few moments  boy would come running down  flagged walk  dash out into  street  if   rushing  announce some wonder   world alexandra felt  great tenderness  them all she wished one  them would stop  speak  her she wished she could ask them whether they had known emil as she lingered   south gate she actually did encounter one   boys he had  his drill cap   swinging his books   end   long strap it  dark  this time  did not see her  ran against her he snatched off his cap  stood bareheaded  panting “i’m awfully sorry”  said   bright clear voice   rising inflection  if  expected her  say something “oh   my fault” said alexandra eagerly “are you  old student here may i ask” “no ma’am i’m  freshie just off  farm cherry county were you hunting somebody” “no thank you that is—” alexandra wanted  detain him “that is i would like  find some  my brother’s friends he graduated two years ago” “then you’d have  try  seniors wouldn’t you let’s see i don’t know any  them yet but there’ll  sure   some  them around  library that red building right there”  pointed “thank you i’ll try there” said alexandra lingeringly “oh that’s all right goodnight” the lad clapped his cap  his head  ran straight down eleventh street alexandra looked after him wistfully she walked back  her hotel unreasonably comforted “what  nice voice  boy had  how polite  was i know emil  always like   women” and again after she had undressed   standing  her nightgown brushing her long heavy hair   electric light she remembered him  said  herself “i don’t think i ever heard  nicer voice than  boy had i hope   get  well here cherry county that’s where  hay  so fine   coyotes can scratch down  water” at nine o’clock  next morning alexandra presented herself   warden’s office   state penitentiary the warden   german  ruddy cheerfullooking man who had formerly been  harnessmaker alexandra had  letter  him   german banker  hanover as  glanced   letter mr schwartz put away his pipe “that big bohemian  it sure he’s gettin’ along fine” said mr schwartz cheerfully “i am glad  hear that i  afraid  might  quarrelsome  get himself into more trouble mr schwartz if you have time i would like  tell you  little about frank shabata  why i am interested  him” the warden listened genially while she told him briefly something  frank’s history  character but  did not seem  find anything unusual  her account “sure i’ll keep  eye  him we’ll take care  him all right”  said rising “you can talk  him here while i go  see  things   kitchen i’ll have him sent in he ought   done washing out his cell  this time we have  keep ’em clean you know” the warden paused   door speaking back over his shoulder   pale young man  convicts’ clothes who  seated   desk   corner writing   big ledger “bertie when   brought in you just step out  give this lady  chance  talk” the young man bowed his head  bent over his ledger again when mr schwartz disappeared alexandra thrust her blackedged handkerchief nervously into her handbag coming out   streetcar she had not had  least dread  meeting frank but since she had been here  sounds  smells   corridor  look   men  convicts’ clothes who passed  glass door   warden’s office affected her unpleasantly the warden’s clock ticked  young convict’s pen scratched busily   big book  his sharp shoulders  shaken every few seconds   loose cough which  tried  smother it  easy  see     sick man alexandra looked  him timidly but  did not once raise his eyes he wore  white shirt under his striped jacket  high collar   necktie very carefully tied his hands  thin  white  well cared for   had  seal ring  his little finger when  heard steps approaching   corridor  rose blotted his book put his pen   rack  left  room without raising his eyes through  door  opened  guard came in bringing frank shabata “you  lady  wanted  talk   here  is be  your good behavior now he can set down lady” seeing  alexandra remained standing “push  white button when you’re through  him  i’ll come” the guard went out  alexandra  frank  left alone alexandra tried not  see his hideous clothes she tried  look straight into his face which she could scarcely believe  his it  already bleached   chalky gray his lips  colorless his fine teeth looked yellowish he glanced  alexandra sullenly blinked  if  had come   dark place  one eyebrow twitched continually she felt  once  this interview   terrible ordeal  him his shaved head showing  conformation  his skull gave him  criminal look which  had not had during  trial alexandra held out her hand “frank” she said her eyes filling suddenly “i hope you’ll let me  friendly  you i understand how you did it i don’t feel hard toward you they  more  blame than you” frank jerked  dirty blue handkerchief  his trousers pocket he had begun  cry he turned away  alexandra “i never did mean  do not’ing  dat woman”  muttered “i never mean  do not’ing  dat boy i ain’t had not’ing ag’in’ dat boy i always like dat boy fine an’ then i find him—” he stopped the feeling went out  his face  eyes he dropped into  chair  sat looking stolidly   floor his hands hanging loosely between his knees  handkerchief lying across his striped leg he seemed  have stirred up  his mind  disgust  had paralyzed his faculties “i haven’t come up here  blame you frank i think they  more  blame than you” alexandra too felt benumbed frank looked up suddenly  stared out   office window “i guess dat place all go  hell what i work so hard on”  said   slow bitter smile “i not care  damn” he stopped  rubbed  palm  his hand over  light bristles  his head  annoyance “i no can t’ink without my hair”  complained “i forget english we not talk here except swear” alexandra  bewildered frank seemed  have undergone  change  personality there  scarcely anything  which she could recognize her handsome bohemian neighbor he seemed somehow not altogether human she did not know what  say  him “you do not feel hard  me frank” she asked  last frank clenched his fist  broke out  excitement “i not feel hard  no woman i tell you i not  kinda man i never hit my wife no never i hurt her when she devil me something awful” he struck his fist down   warden’s desk so hard   afterward stroked  absently a pale pink crept over his neck  face “two t’ree years i know dat woman don’ care no more ’bout me alexandra bergson i know she after some other man i know her oooo an’ i ain’t never hurt her i never woulda done dat if i ain’t had dat gun along i don’ know what  hell make me take dat gun she always say i ain’t no man  carry gun if she been  dat house where she oughta been—but das  foolish talk” frank rubbed his head  stopped suddenly   had stopped before alexandra felt  there  something strange   way  chilled off  if something came up  him  extinguished his power  feeling or thinking “yes frank” she said kindly “i know you never meant  hurt marie” frank smiled  her queerly his eyes filled slowly  tears “you know i most forgit dat woman’s name she ain’t got no name  me no more i never hate my wife but dat woman what make me do dat—honest  god but i hate her i no man  fight i don’ want  kill no boy  no woman i not care how many men she take under dat tree i no care  not’ing but dat fine boy i kill alexandra bergson i guess i go crazy sure ’nough” alexandra remembered  little yellow cane she had found  frank’s clothescloset she thought  how  had come  this country  gay young fellow so attractive   prettiest bohemian girl  omaha had run away  him it seemed unreasonable  life should have landed him  such  place  this she blamed marie bitterly and why  her happy affectionate nature should she have brought destruction  sorrow  all who had loved her even  poor old joe tovesky  uncle who used  carry her about so proudly when she   little girl that   strangest thing  all was there then something wrong  being warmhearted  impulsive like that alexandra hated  think so but there  emil   norwegian graveyard  home  here  frank shabata alexandra rose  took him   hand “frank shabata i am never going  stop trying until i get you pardoned i’ll never give  governor any peace i know i can get you out  this place” frank looked  her distrustfully but  gathered confidence  her face “alexandra”  said earnestly “if i git outa here i not trouble dis country no more i go back where i come from see my mother” alexandra tried  withdraw her hand but frank held    nervously he put out his finger  absently touched  button  her black jacket “alexandra”  said   low tone looking steadily   button “you ain’ t’ink i use dat girl awful bad before—” “no frank we won’t talk about that” alexandra said pressing his hand “i can’t help emil now so i’m going  do what i can  you you know i don’t go away  home often  i came up here  purpose  tell you this” the warden   glass door looked  inquiringly alexandra nodded   came   touched  white button  his desk the guard appeared    sinking heart alexandra saw frank led away down  corridor after  few words  mr schwartz she left  prison  made her way   streetcar she had refused  horror  warden’s cordial invitation  “go through  institution” as  car lurched over  uneven roadbed back toward lincoln alexandra thought  how she  frank had been wrecked   same storm   how although she could come out into  sunlight she had not much more left  her life than he she remembered some lines   poem she had liked  her schooldays— henceforth  world  only  a wider prisonhouse  me—  sighed a disgust  life weighed upon her heart some such feeling  had twice frozen frank shabata’s features while they talked together she wished she  back   divide when alexandra entered her hotel  clerk held up one finger  beckoned  her as she approached his desk  handed her  telegram alexandra took  yellow envelope  looked    perplexity then stepped into  elevator without opening it as she walked down  corridor toward her room she reflected  she was   manner immune  evil tidings on reaching her room she locked  door  sitting down   chair   dresser opened  telegram it   hanover   read— arrived hanover last night shall wait here until you come please hurry carl linstrum alexandra put her head down   dresser  burst into tears iii the next afternoon carl  alexandra  walking across  fields  mrs hiller’s alexandra had left lincoln after midnight  carl had met her   hanover station early   morning after they reached home alexandra had gone over  mrs hiller’s  leave  little present she had bought  her   city they stayed   old lady’s door but  moment  then came out  spend  rest   afternoon   sunny fields alexandra had taken off her black traveling suit  put   white dress partly because she saw  her black clothes made carl uncomfortable  partly because she felt oppressed  them herself they seemed  little like  prison where she had worn them yesterday    out  place   open fields carl had changed very little his cheeks  browner  fuller he looked less like  tired scholar than when  went away  year ago but no one even now would have taken him   man  business his soft lustrous black eyes his whimsical smile would  less against him   klondike than   divide there  always dreamers   frontier carl  alexandra had been talking since morning her letter had never reached him he had first learned  her misfortune   san francisco paper four weeks old which  had picked up   saloon  which contained  brief account  frank shabata’s trial when  put down  paper  had already made up his mind   could reach alexandra  quickly   letter could  ever since  had been   way day  night   fastest boats  trains  could catch his steamer had been held back two days  rough weather as they came out  mrs hiller’s garden they took up their talk again where they had left it “but could you come away like that carl without arranging things could you just walk off  leave your business” alexandra asked carl laughed “prudent alexandra you see my dear i happen  have  honest partner i trust him  everything in fact it’s been his enterprise   beginning you know i’m   only because  took me in i’ll have  go back   spring perhaps you  want  go  me then we haven’t turned up millions yet but we’ve got  start that’s worth following but this winter i’d like  spend  you you won’t feel  we ought  wait longer  emil’s account  you alexandra” alexandra shook her head “no carl i don’t feel  way about it and surely you needn’t mind anything lou  oscar say now they  much angrier  me about emil now than about you they say   all my fault that i ruined him  sending him  college” “no i don’t care  button  lou or oscar the moment i knew you   trouble  moment i thought you might need me  all looked different you’ve always been  triumphant kind  person” carl hesitated looking sidewise  her strong full figure “but you do need me now alexandra” she put her hand  his arm “i needed you terribly when  happened carl i cried  you  night then everything seemed  get hard inside  me  i thought perhaps i should never care  you again but when i got your telegram yesterday then—then   just   used  be you  all i have   world you know” carl pressed her hand  silence they  passing  shabatas’ empty house now but they avoided  orchard path  took one  led over   pasture pond “can you understand it carl” alexandra murmured “i have had nobody but ivar  signa  talk to do talk  me can you understand it could you have believed   marie tovesky i would have been cut  pieces little  little before i would have betrayed her trust  me” carl looked   shining spot  water before them “maybe she  cut  pieces too alexandra i am sure she tried hard they both did that  why emil went  mexico  course and   going away again you tell me though  had only been home three weeks you remember  sunday when i went  emil up   french church fair i thought  day there  some kind  feeling something unusual between them i meant  talk  you about it but  my way back i met lou  oscar  got so angry  i forgot everything else you mustn’t  hard  them alexandra sit down here   pond  minute i want  tell you something” they sat down   grasstufted bank  carl told her how  had seen emil  marie out   pond  morning more than  year ago  how young  charming  full  grace they had seemed  him “it happens like    world sometimes alexandra”  added earnestly “i’ve seen  before there  women who spread ruin around them through no fault  theirs just  being too beautiful too full  life  love they can’t help it people come  them  people go   warm fire  winter i used  feel   her when she   little girl do you remember how all  bohemians crowded round her   store  day when she gave emil her candy you remember those yellow sparks  her eyes” alexandra sighed “yes people couldn’t help loving her poor frank does even now i think though he’s got himself  such  tangle    long time his love  been bitterer than his hate but if you saw there  anything wrong you ought  have told me carl” carl took her hand  smiled patiently “my dear   something one felt   air  you feel  spring coming or  storm  summer i didn’t see anything simply when i   those two young things i felt my blood go quicker i felt—how shall i say it—an acceleration  life after i got away   all too delicate too intangible  write about” alexandra looked  him mournfully “i try   more liberal about such things than i used  be i try  realize  we  not all made alike only why couldn’t  have been raoul marcel or jan smirka why did  have   my boy” “because    best there was i suppose they  both  best you had here” the sun  dropping low   west when  two friends rose  took  path again the strawstacks  throwing long shadows  owls  flying home   prairiedog town when they came   corner where  pastures joined alexandra’s twelve young colts  galloping   drove over  brow   hill “carl” said alexandra “i should like  go up there  you   spring i haven’t been   water since we crossed  ocean when i   little girl after we first came out here i used  dream sometimes about  shipyard where father worked   little sort  inlet full  masts” alexandra paused after  moment’s thought she said “but you would never ask me  go away  good would you” “of course not my dearest i think i know how you feel about this country  well  you do yourself” carl took her hand  both his own  pressed  tenderly “yes i still feel  way though emil  gone when i    train this morning  we got near hanover i felt something like i did when i drove back  emil   river  time   dry year i  glad  come back  it i’ve lived here  long time there  great peace here carl  freedom i thought when i came out   prison where poor frank is  i should never feel free again but i do here” alexandra took  deep breath  looked off into  red west “you belong   land” carl murmured “as you have always said now more than ever” “yes now more than ever you remember what you once said about  graveyard   old story writing itself over only   we who write it   best we have” they paused   last ridge   pasture overlooking  house   windmill   stables  marked  site  john bergson’s homestead on every side  brown waves   earth rolled away  meet  sky “lou  oscar can’t see those things” said alexandra suddenly “suppose i do  my land  their children what difference   make the land belongs   future carl that’s  way  seems  me how many   names   county clerk’s plat   there  fifty years i might  well try    sunset over there  my brother’s children we come  go but  land  always here and  people who love   understand    people who own it—for  little while” carl looked  her wonderingly she  still gazing into  west   her face there   exalted serenity  sometimes came  her  moments  deep feeling the level rays   sinking sun shone  her clear eyes “why  you thinking  such things now alexandra” “i had  dream before i went  lincoln—but i  tell you about  afterward after we  married it  never come true now   way i thought  might” she took carl’s arm  they walked toward  gate “how many times we have walked this path together carl how many times we  walk  again does  seem  you like coming back  your own place do you feel  peace   world here i think we shall  very happy i haven’t any fears i think when friends marry they  safe we don’t suffer like—those young ones” alexandra ended   sigh they had reached  gate before carl opened it  drew alexandra  him  kissed her softly  her lips   her eyes she leaned heavily  his shoulder “i am tired” she murmured “i have been very lonely carl” they went into  house together leaving  divide
