straight again  she let fly she says “youll  excused you will well i never heard  like    all my days the idea  you talking like   me now take yourself off  pack your traps  if i hear another word out

so out  his head  gladness because   going traveling and  says “before we get away shell wish she hadnt let me go but she wont know any way  get around  now after what shes said her pride wont let her take  back” tom  packed  ten minutes all except what his aunt  mary would finish up  him then we waited ten more  her  get cooled down  sweet  gentle again  tom said  took her ten minutes  unruffle  times when half  her feathers  up but twenty when they  all up  this  one   times when they  all up then we went down being   sweat  know what  letter said she  setting there   brown study   laying  her lap we set down  she says “theyre  considerable trouble down there  they think you  huckll   kind  diversion  themcomfort they say much   theyll get out  you  huck finn i reckon theres  neighbor

thats what they say they dont hear about him any more” “what  his name” “jake” there wasnt anything more said   considerable while  old lady  thinking at last she says “the thing   mostly worrying your aunt sally   tempers   man jubiter gets your uncle into” tom  astonished  so  i tom says “tempers uncle silas land you must  joking i didnt know  had any temper” “works him up into perfect rages your aunt sally says says  acts  if  would really hit  man sometimes” “aunt polly  beats anything i ever heard of why hes just  gentle  mush” “well shes worried anyway says your uncle silas  like

just  angel what can   matter  him do you reckon” chapter ii jake dunlap we had powerful good luck because we got  chance   sternwheeler  away north which  bound  one  them bayous or onehorse rivers away down louisiana way  so we could go all  way down  upper mississippi  all  way down  lower mississippi   farm  arkansaw without having  change steamboats  st louis not so very much short   thousand miles  one pull a pretty lonesome boat there warnt but few passengers  all old folks  set around wide apart dozing   very quiet we  four days getting out   “upper river” because we got aground so much but  warnt dullcouldnt   boys   traveling  course from  very start me  tom allowed  there  somebody sick   stateroom next  ourn because  meals  always toted  there   waiters by   we asked about ittom did   waiter said    man but  didnt look sick “well but aint  sick” “i dont know maybe  is but pears  me hes just letting on” “what makes you think that” “because if   sick  would pull his clothes off some time or otherdont you reckon  would well this one dont at least  dont ever pull off his boots anyway” “the mischief  dont not even when  goes  bed” “no” it  always nuts  tom sawyera mystery was if youd lay out  mystery   pie before me  him you wouldnt have  say take your choice    thing  would regulate itself because  my nature i have always run  pie whilst  his nature   always run  mystery people  made different and    best way tom says   waiter “whats  mans name” “phillips” “whered  come aboard” “i think  got aboard  elexandria up   iowa line” “what do you reckon hes aplaying” “i haint any notioni never thought  it” i says  myself heres another one  runs  pie “anything peculiar about himthe way  acts or talks” “nonothing except  seems so scary  keeps his doors locked night  day both  when you knock  wont let you  till  opens  door  crack  sees who  is” “by jimminy its intresting id like  get  look  him saythe next time youre going  there dont you reckon you could spread  door and” “no indeedy hes always behind it he would block  game” tom studied over it  then  says “looky here you lend me your apern  let me take him his breakfast   morning ill give you  quarter” the boy  plenty willing enough if  head steward wouldnt mind tom says thats all right  reckoned  could fix    head steward   done it he fixed  so  we could both go   aperns   toting vittles he didnt sleep much    such  sweat  get  there  find out  mystery about phillips  moreover  done  lot  guessing about  all night which warnt no use  if you  going  find out  facts   thing whats  sense  guessing out what aint  facts  wasting ammunition i didnt lose no sleep i wouldnt give  dern  know whats  matter  phillips i says  myself well   morning we put   aperns  got  couple  trays  truck  tom  knocked   door the man opened   crack  then  let us   shut  quick by jackson when we got  sight  him we most dropped  trays  tom says “why jubiter dunlap whered you come from” well  man  astonished  course  first off  looked like  didnt know whether   scared or glad or both or which but finally  settled down  being glad  then his color come back though  first his face had turned pretty white so we got  talking together while  et his breakfast and  says “but i aint jubiter dunlap id just  soon tell you who i am though if youll swear  keep mum  i aint no phillips either” tom says “well keep mum but there aint any need  tell who you  if you aint jubiter dunlap” “why” “because if you aint him youre tother twin jake youre  spitn image  jubiter” “well im jake but looky here how do you come  know us dunlaps” tom told about  adventures wed had down there  his uncle silass last summer  when  see  there warnt anything about his folksor him either   matterthat we didnt know  opened out  talked perfectly free  candid he never made any bones about his own case said hed been  hard lot   hard lot yet  reckoned hed   hard lot plumb   end he said  course    dangerous life andhe give  kind  gasp  set his head like  person thats listening we didnt say anything  so   very still   second or so  there warnt no sounds but  screaking   woodwork   chugchugging   machinery down below then we got him comfortable again telling him about his people  how braces wife had been dead three years  brace wanted  marry benny  she shook him  jubiter  working  uncle silas  him  uncle silas quarreling all  timeand then  let go  laughed “land”  says “its like old times  hear all this tittletattle  does me good its been seven years  more since i heard any how do they talk about me these days” “who” “the farmersand  family” “why they dont talk about you  allat least only just  mention once   long time” “the nation”  says surprised “why  that” “because they think you  dead long ago” “no are you speaking truehonor bright now” he jumped up excited “honor bright there aint anybody thinks you  alive” “then im saved im saved sure ill go home theyll hide me  save my life you keep mum swear youll keep mumswear youll never never tell  me oh boys  good   poor devil thats being hunted day  night  dasnt show his face ive never done you any harm ill never do you any  god    heavens swear youll  good  me  help me save my life” wed  swore  if hed been  dog  so we done it well  couldnt love us enough   or  grateful enough poor cuss   all  could do  keep  hugging us we talked along   got out  little handbag  begun  open it  told us  turn our backs we done it  when  told us  turn again   perfectly different  what   before he had  blue goggles   naturalestlooking long brown whiskers  mustashes you ever see his own mother wouldnt a knowed him he asked us if  looked like his brother jubiter now “no” tom said “there aint anything left thats like him except  long hair” “all right ill get  cropped close  my head before i get there then him  brace  keep my secret  ill live  them  being  stranger   neighbors wont ever guess me out what do you think” tom  studied awhile then  says “well  course me  huck  going  keep mum there but if you dont keep mum yourself theres going    little bit   riskit aint much maybe but its  little i mean if you talk wont people notice  your voice  just like jubiters  mightnt  make them think   twin they reckoned  dead but maybe after all  hid all this time under another name” “by george”  says “youre  sharp one youre perfectly right ive got  play deef  dumb when theres  neighbor around if id  struck  home  forgot  little detailhowever i wasnt striking  home i  breaking  any place where i could get away  these fellows   after me then i  going  put  this disguise  get some different clothes and” he jumped   outside door  laid his ear against   listened pale  kind  panting presently  whispers “sounded like cocking  gun lord what  life  lead” then  sunk down   chair all limp  sick like  wiped  sweat off  his face chapter iii a diamond robbery from  time out we   him most all  time  one or tother  us slept  his upper berth he said  had been so lonesome    such  comfort  him  have company  somebody  talk   his troubles we    sweat  find out what his secret was but tom said  best way  not  seem anxious then likely  would drop into  himself  one  his talks but if we got  asking questions  would get suspicious  shet up his shell it turned out just so it warnt no trouble  see   wanted  talk about it but always along  first  would scare away   when  got   very edge  it  go  talking about something else the way  come about  this he got  asking us kind  indifferent like about  passengers down  deck we told him about them but  warnt satisfied we warnt particular enough he told us  describe them better tom done it at last when tom  describing one   roughest  raggedest ones  gave  shiver   gasp  says “oh lordy thats one  them theyre aboard surei just knowed it i sort  hoped i had got away but i never believed it go on” presently when tom  describing another mangy rough deck passenger  give  shiver again  says “thats himthats  other one if  would only come  good black stormy night  i could get ashore you see theyve got spies  me theyve got  right  come up  buy drinks   bar yonder forrard  they take  chance  bribe somebody  keep watch  meporter or boots or somebody if i   slip ashore without anybody seeing me they would know  inside   hour” so then  got  wandering along  pretty soon sure enough   telling he  poking along through his ups  downs  when  come   place  went right along he says “it   confidence game we played    juleryshop  st louis what we  after   couple  noble big dimonds  big  hazelnuts which everybody  running  see we  dressed up fine  we played   them  broad daylight we ordered  dimonds sent   hotel  us  see if we wanted  buy  when we  examining them we had paste counterfeits all ready  them   things  went back   shop when we said  water wasnt quite fine enough  twelve thousand dollars” “twelvethousanddollars” tom says “was they really worth all  money do you reckon” “every cent  it” “and you fellows got away  them” “as easy  nothing i dont reckon  julery people know theyve been robbed yet but  wouldnt  good sense  stay around st louis  course so we considered where wed go one   going one way one another so we throwed up heads or tails   upper mississippi won we done up  dimonds   paper  put our names    put    keep   hotel clerk  told him not  ever let either  us have  again without  others   hand  see  done then we went down town each  his own selfbecause i reckon maybe we all had  same notion i dont know  certain but i reckon maybe we had” “what notion” tom says “to rob  others” “whatone take everything after all  you had helped  get it” “certnly” it disgusted tom sawyer   said    orneriest lowdownest thing  ever heard of but jake dunlap said  warnt unusual   profession said when  person    line  business hed got  look out  his own intrust there warnt nobody else going  do   him and then  went on he says “you see  trouble was you couldnt divide up two dimonds amongst three if thered been threebut never mind about that there warnt three i loafed along  back streets studying  studying and i says  myself ill hog them dimonds  first chance i get  ill have  disguise all ready  ill give  boys  slip  when im safe away ill put  on  then let them find me if they can so i got  false whiskers   goggles  this countrified suit  clothes  fetched them along back   handbag  when i  passing  shop where they sell all sorts  things i got  glimpse  one  my pals through  window it  bud dixon i  glad you bet i says  myself ill see what  buys so i kept shady  watched now what do you reckon    bought” “whiskers” said i “no” “goggles” “no” “oh keep still huck finn cant you youre only just hendering all you can what was   bought jake” “youd never guess   world it  only just  screwdriverjust  wee little bit   screwdriver” “well i declare what did  want  that” “thats what i thought it  curious it clean stumped me i says  myself what can  want   thing well when  come out i stood back out  sight  then tracked him   secondhand slopshop  see him buy  red flannel shirt  some old ragged clothesjust  ones hes got  now  youve described then i went down   wharf  hid my things aboard  upriver boat  we had picked out  then started back  had another streak  luck i seen our other pal lay  his stock  old rusty secondhanders we got  dimonds  went aboard  boat “but now we  up  stump  we couldnt go  bed we had  set up  watch one another pity  was pity  put  kind   strain  us because there  bad blood between us   couple  weeks back  we  only friends   way  business bad anyway seeing there  only two dimonds betwixt three men first we had supper  then tramped up  down  deck together smoking till most midnight then we went  set down  my stateroom  locked  doors  looked   piece  paper  see if  dimonds  all right then laid    lower berth right  full sight  there we set  set  byandby  got   dreadful hard  keep awake at last bud dixon  dropped off as soon    snoring  good regular gait   likely  last  had his chin  his breast  looked permanent hal clayton nodded towards  dimonds  then towards  outside door  i understood i reached  got  paper  then we stood up  waited perfectly still bud never stirred i turned  key   outside door very soft  slow then turned  knob  same way  we went tiptoeing out onto  guard  shut  door very soft  gentle “there warnt nobody stirring anywhere   boat  slipping along swift  steady through  big water   smoky moonlight we never said  word but went straight up onto  hurricanedeck  plumb back aft  set down   end   skylight both  us knowed what  meant without having  explain  one another bud dixon would wake up  miss  swag  would come straight  us   aint afeard  anything or anybody  man aint he would come  we would heave him overboard or get killed trying it made me shiver because i aint  brave  some people but if i showed  white featherwell i knowed better than do that i kind  hoped  boat would land somers  we could skip ashore  not have  run  risk  this row i  so scared  bud dixon but she   upperriver tub  there warnt no real chance  that “well  time strung along  along   fellow never come why  strung along till dawn begun  break  still  never come thunder i says what do you make out  thisaint  suspicious land hal says do you reckon hes playing usopen  paper i done it   gracious there warnt anything   but  couple  little pieces  loafsugar thats  reason  could set there  snooze all night so comfortable smart well i reckon he had had them two papers all fixed  ready   had put one  them  place  tother right under our noses “we felt pretty cheap but  thing  do straight off   make  plan  we done it we would do up  paper again just   was  slip in very elaborate  soft  lay    bunk again  let  we didnt know about any trick  hadnt any idea   alaughing  us behind them bogus snores  hisn  we would stick  him   first night we  ashore we would get him drunk  search him  get  dimonds  do  him too if  warnt too risky if we got  swag wed got  do  him or  would hunt us down  do  us sure but i didnt have no real hope i knowed we could get him drunkhe  always ready  thatbut whats  good  it you might search him  year  never findwell right there i catched my breath  broke off my thought for  idea went ripping through my head  tore my brains  ragsand land but i felt gay  good you see i had had my boots off  unswell my feet  just then i took up one  them  put  on  i catched  glimpse   heelbottom   just took my breath away you remember about  puzzlesome little screwdriver” “you bet i do” says tom all excited “well when i catched  glimpse   boot heel  idea  went smashing through my head was i know where hes hid  dimonds you look  this boot heel now see its bottomed   steel plate   plate  fastened   little screws now there wasnt  screw about  feller anywhere but  his boot heels so if  needed  screwdriver i reckoned i knowed why” “huck aint  bully” says tom “well i got my boots on  we went down  slipped   laid  paper  sugar   berth  sat down soft  sheepish  went  listening  bud dixon snore hal clayton dropped off pretty soon but i didnt i wasnt ever so wide awake  my life i  spying out  under  shade  my hat brim searching  floor  leather it took me  long time  i begun  think maybe my guess  wrong but  last i struck it it laid over   bulkhead   nearly  color   carpet it   little round plug about  thick   end  your little finger  i says  myself theres  dimond   nest youve come from before long i spied out  plugs mate “think   smartness  coolness   blatherskite he put up

screw  his plates again he allowed we would steal  bogus swag  wait all night  him  come up  get drownded   george its just what we done i think   powerful smart” “you bet your life  was” says tom just full  admiration chapter iv the three sleepers well all day we went through  humbug  watching one another    pretty sickly business  two  us  hard  act out i can tell you about night we landed  one  them little missouri towns high up toward iowa  had supper   tavern  got  room upstairs   cot   double bed  it but i dumped my bag under  deal table   dark hall while we  moving along   bed single file me last   landlord   lead   tallow candle we had up  lot  whisky  went  playing highlowjack  dimes   soon   whisky begun  take hold  bud we stopped drinking but we didnt let him stop we loaded him till  fell out  his chair  laid there snoring “we  ready  business now i said we better pull our boots off  hisn too  not make any noise then we could pull him  haul him around  ransack him without any trouble so we done it i set my boots  buds side  side where theyd  handy then we stripped him  searched his seams  his pockets  his socks   inside  his boots  everything  searched his bundle never found any dimonds we found  screwdriver  hal says what do you reckon  wanted  that i said i didnt know but when  wasnt looking i hooked it at last hal  looked beat  discouraged  said wed got  give  up that  what i  waiting for i says “theres one place we haint searched “what place  that  says “his stomach “by gracious i never thought  that now were   homestretch   dead moral certainty howll we manage “well i says just stay  him till i turn out  hunt up  drug store  i reckon ill fetch something thatll make them dimonds tired   company theyre keeping “he said thats  ticket   him looking straight  me i slid myself into buds boots instead  my own   never noticed they  just  shade large  me but   considerable better than being too small i got my bag  i went agroping through  hall   about  minute i  out  back way  stretching up  river road   fivemile gait “and not feeling so very bad neitherwalking  dimonds dont have no such effect when i had gone fifteen minutes i says  myself theres moren  mile behind me  everything quiet another five minutes  i says theres considerable more land behind me now  theres  man back there thats begun  wonder whats  trouble another five  i says  myself hes getting real uneasyhes walking  floor now another five  i says  myself theres two mile   half behind me  hes awful uneasybeginning  cuss i reckon pretty soon i says  myself forty minutes gonehe knows theres something up fifty minutesthe truths abusting  him now   reckoning i found  dimonds whilst we  searching  shoved them  my pocket  never let onyes  hes starting out  hunt  me hell hunt  new tracks   dust  theyll  likely send him down  river  up “just then i see  man coming down   mule  before i thought i jumped into  bush it  stupid when  got abreast  stopped  waited  little  me  come out then  rode  again but i didnt feel gay any more i says  myself ive botched my chances  that i surely have if  meets up  hal clayton “well about three   morning i fetched elexandria  see this sternwheeler laying there   very glad because i felt perfectly safe now you know it  just daybreak i went aboard  got this stateroom  put  these clothes  went up   pilothouseto watch though i didnt reckon there  any need  it i set there  played  my dimonds  waited  waited   boat  start but she didnt you see they  mending her machinery but i didnt know anything about it not being very much used  steamboats “well  cut  tale short we never left there till plumb noon  long before  i  hid  this stateroom  before breakfast i see  man coming away off  had  gait like hal claytons   made me just sick i says  myself if  finds out im aboard this boat hes got me like  rat   trap all hes got  do   have me watched  waitwait till i slip ashore thinking    thousand miles away then slip after me  dog me   good place  make me give up  dimonds  then helloh i know what hell do aint  awfulawful and now  think  other ones aboard too oh aint  hard luck boysaint  hard but youll help save me wont youoh boys  good   poor devil thats being hunted  death  save meill worship  very ground you walk on” we turned   soothed him down  told him we would plan  him  help him   neednt  so afeard  so     got  feeling kind  comfortable again  unscrewed his heelplates  held up his dimonds this way  that admiring them  loving them  when  light struck into them they was beautiful sure why they seemed  kind  bust  snap fire out all around but all  same i judged    fool if i had been him i would  handed  dimonds  them pals  got them  go ashore  leave me alone but   made different he said    whole fortune   couldnt bear  idea twice we stopped  fix  machinery  laid  good while once   night but  wasnt dark enough    afeard  skip but  third time we had  fix  there   better chance we laid up   country woodyard about forty mile above uncle silass place  little after one  night    thickening up  going  storm so jake  laid   chance  slide we begun  take  wood pretty soon  rain come adrenching down   wind blowed hard of course every boathand fixed  gunny sack  put   like  bonnet  way they do when they  toting wood  we got one  jake   slipped down aft  his handbag  come tramping forrard just like  rest  walked ashore  them  when we see him pass out   light   torchbasket  get swallowed up   dark we got our breath again  just felt grateful  splendid but  wasnt  long somebody told i reckon   about eight or ten minutes them two pals come tearing forrard  tight  they could jump  darted ashore   gone we waited plumb till dawn  them  come back  kept hoping they would but they never did we  awful sorry  lowspirited all  hope we had   jake had got such  start  they couldnt get  his track   would get  his brothers  hide there   safe he  going  take  river road  told us  find out if brace  jubiter   home  no strangers there  then slip out about sundown  tell him said  would wait  us   little bunch  sycamores right back  toms uncle silass tobacker field   river road  lonesome place we set  talked  long time about his chances  tom said   all right if  pals struck up  river instead  down but  wasnt likely because maybe they knowed where   from more likely they would

off but i pulled myself together again  says “it  when   spading up some ground along  you towards sundown or along there” he only said “um”   kind   disappointed way  didnt take no more intrust so i went on i says “well then  i  asaying” “thatll do you neednt go no furder” it  aunt sally she  boring right into me  her eyes  very indignant “huck finn” she says “howd them men come  talk about going

hunt strawberries   dogand  lantern” but she busted   him there  just piled into him  snowed him under she  so mad she couldnt get  words out fast enough  she gushed them out  one everlasting freshet that  what tom sawyer  after he allowed  work her up  get her started  then leave her alone  let her burn herself out then she would  so aggravated   subject  she wouldnt say another word about it nor let anybody else well  happened just so when she  tuckered out  had  hold up  says quite cam “and yet all  same aunt sally” “shet up” she says “i dont want  hear another word out  you” so we  perfectly safe then  didnt have no more trouble about  delay tom done  elegant chapter vii a nights vigil benny she  looking pretty sober  she sighed some now  then but pretty soon she got  asking about mary  sid  toms aunt polly  then aunt sallys clouds cleared off  she got   good humor  joined    questions   her lovingest best self  so  rest   supper went along gay  pleasant but  old man  didnt take any hand hardly   absentminded  restless  done  considerable amount  sighing    kind  heartbreaking  see him so sad  troubled  worried by  by  spell after supper come  nigger  knocked   door  put his head   his old straw hat  his hand bowing  scraping  said his marse brace  out   stile  wanted his brother   getting tired waiting supper  him  would marse silas please tell him where  was i never see uncle silas speak up so sharp  fractious before he says “am i his brothers keeper” and then  kind  wilted together  looked like  wished  hadnt spoken so  then  says very gentle “but you neednt say that billy i  took sudden  irritable  i aint very well these days  not hardly responsible tell him  aint here” and when  nigger  gone  got up  walked  floor backwards  forwards mumbling  muttering  himself  plowing his hands through his hair it  real pitiful  see him aunt sally she whispered  us  told us not  take notice  him  embarrassed him she said   always thinking  thinking since these troubles come on  she allowed  didnt moren about half know what   about when  thinking spells   him  she said  walked  his sleep considerable more now than  used to  sometimes wandered around over  house  even outdoors  his sleep  if we catched him   we must let him alone  not disturb him she said she reckoned  didnt do him no harm  may   done him good she said benny   only one   much help  him these days said benny appeared  know just when  try  soothe him  when  leave him alone so  kept  tramping up  down  floor  muttering till     begun  look pretty tired then benny she went  snuggled up  his side  put one hand  his  one arm around his waist  walked  him   smiled down  her  reached down  kissed her  so little  little  trouble went out  his face  she persuaded him off  his room they had very petting ways together    uncommon pretty  see aunt sally she  busy getting  children ready  bed so     got dull  tedious  me  tom took  turn   moonlight  fetched up   watermelonpatch  et one  had  good deal  talk and tom said hed bet  quarreling  all jubiters fault    going    hand  first time  got  chance  see  if   so   going  do his level best  get uncle silas  turn him off and so we talked  smoked  stuffed watermelons much  two hours  then   pretty late  when we got back  house  quiet  dark  everybody gone  bed tom  always seen everything  now  see   old green baize workgown  gone  said  wasnt gone when  went out so  allowed   curious  then we went up  bed we could hear benny stirring around  her room which  next  ourn  judged she  worried  good deal about her father  couldnt sleep we found we couldnt neither so we set up  long time  smoked  talked   low voice  felt pretty dull  downhearted we talked  murder   ghost over  over again  got so creepy  crawly we couldnt get sleepy nohow  noway by  by when   away late   night  all  sounds  late sounds  solemn tom nudged me  whispers  me  look  i done it  there we see  man poking around   yard like  didnt know just what  wanted  do but   pretty dim  we couldnt see him good then  started   stile    went over   moon came out strong   had  longhandled shovel over his shoulder  we see  white patch   old workgown so tom says “hes awalking  his sleep i wish we  allowed  follow him  see where hes going to there hes turned down   tobackerfield out  sight now its  dreadful pity  cant rest no better” we waited  long time but  didnt come back any more or if  did  come around  other way so  last we  tuckered out  went  sleep  had nightmares  million  them but before dawn we  awake again because meantime  storm had come up  been raging   thunder  lightning  awful   wind  athrashing  trees around   rain  driving down  slanting sheets   gullies  running rivers tom says “looky here huck ill tell you one thing thats mighty curious up   time we went out last night  family hadnt heard about jake dunlap being murdered now  men  chased hal clayton  bud dixon away would spread  thing around   half  hour  every neighbor  heard  would shin out  fly around  one farm  tother  try    first  tell  news land they dont have such  big thing    tell twice  thirty year huck its mighty strange i dont understand it” so then     fidget   rain  let up so we could turn out  run across some   people  see if they would say anything about   us and  said if they did we must  horribly surprised  shocked we  out  gone  minute  rain stopped it  just broad day then we loafed along up  road  now  then met  person  stopped  said howdy  told them when we come  how we left  folks  home  how long we  going  stay  all that but none  them said  word about  thing which  just astonishing  no mistake tom said  believed if we went   sycamores we would find  body laying there solitary  alone  not  soul around said  believed  men chased  thieves so far into  woods   thieves probly seen  good chance  turned  them  last  maybe they all killed each other  so there wasnt anybody left  tell first we knowed gabbling along  away we  right   sycamores the cold chills trickled down my back  i wouldnt budge another step  all toms persuading but  couldnt hold in hed got  see if  boots  safe   body yet so  crope inand  next minute out  come again  his eyes bulging   so excited  says “huck its gone” i was astonished i says “tom you dont mean it” “its gone sure there aint  sign  it the ground  trampled some but if there  any blood its all washed away   storm  its all puddles  slush  there” at last i give in  went  took  look myself    just  tom saidthere wasnt  sign   corpse “dern it” i says “the dimonds  gone dont you reckon  thieves slunk back  lugged him off tom” “looks like it it just does now whered they hide him do you reckon” “i dont know” i says disgusted “and whats more i dont care theyve got  boots  thats all i cared about hell lay around these woods  long time before i hunt him up” tom didnt feel no more intrust  him neither only curiosity  know what come  him but  said wed lay low  keep dark   wouldnt  long till  dogs or somebody rousted him out we went back home  breakfast ever so bothered  put out  disappointed  swindled i warnt ever so down   corpse before chapter viii talking with the ghost it warnt very cheerful  breakfast aunt sally she looked old  tired  let  children snarl  fuss  one another  didnt seem  notice   going on which wasnt her usual style me  tom had  plenty  think about without talking benny she looked like she hadnt had much sleep  whenever shed lift her head  little  steal  look towards her father you could see there  tears  her eyes     old man his things stayed  his plate  got cold without him knowing they  there i reckon    thinking  thinking all  time  never said  word  never et  bite by   when   stillest  niggers head  poked    door again   said his marse brace  getting powerful uneasy about marse jubiter which hadnt come home yet  would marse silas pleasehe  looking  uncle silas   stopped there like  rest  his words  froze  uncle silas  rose up shaky  steadied himself leaning his fingers   table    panting  his eyes  set   nigger   kept swallowing  put his other hand up  his throat  couple  times   last  got his words started  says “does hedoes hethinkwhat does  think tell himtell him” then  sunk down  his chair limp  weak  says so  you could hardly hear him “go awaygo away” the nigger looked scared  cleared out  we all feltwell i dont know how we felt but   awful   old man panting there  his eyes set  looking like  person   dying none  us could budge but benny she slid around soft  her tears running down  stood  his side  nestled his old gray head up against her  begun  stroke   pet   her hands  nodded  us  go away  we done it going out very quiet like  dead  there me  tom struck out   woods mighty solemn  saying how different   now  what   last summer when we  here  everything  so peaceful  happy  everybody thought so much  uncle silas    so cheerful  simplehearted  puddnheaded  goodand now look  him if  hadnt lost his mind  wasnt much short  it that  what we allowed it   most lovely day now  bright  sunshiny   further  further we went over  hills towards  prairie  lovelier  lovelier  trees  flowers got     more  seemed strange  somehow wrong  there had   trouble  such  world  this and then all   sudden i catched my breath  grabbed toms arm  all my livers  lungs  things fell down into my legs “there  is” i says we jumped back behind  bush shivering  tom says “shdont make  noise” it  setting   log right   edge   little prairie thinking i tried  get tom  come away but  wouldnt  i dasnt budge  myself he said we mightnt ever get another chance  see one    going  look his fill  this one if  died  it so i looked too though  give me  fantods  do it tom  had  talk but  talked low

see anything look any more naturaler than what it does” “nor i neither” i says “id recognize  anywheres” “so would i it looks perfectly solid  genuwyne just  way  done before  died” so we kept agazing pretty soon tom says “huck theres something mighty curious about this one dont you know it oughtnt   going around   daytime” “thats so tomi never heard  like   before” “no sir they dont ever come out only  nightand then not till after twelve theres something wrong about this one now you mark my words i dont believe its got any right   around   daytime but dont  look natural jake  going  play deef

cropped  way  said  would  hes playing himself   stranger just  same   said  would ghost humhes  sound   nut” then i see  all  how we had took too much  granted i  powerful glad  didnt get killed  so  tom  we wondered which  would like  bestfor us  never let   know him or how tom reckoned  best way would   go  ask him so  started but i kept  little behind because i didnt know but  might   ghost after all when tom got  where  was  says “me  hucks mighty glad  see you again  you neednt  afeared well tell and if you think itll  safer  you if we dont let   know you when we run across you say  word  youll see you can depend  us  would ruther cut our hands off than get you into  least little bit  danger” first off  looked surprised  see us  not very glad either but  tom went   looked pleasanter  when   done  smiled  nodded his head several times  made signs  his hands  says “googoogoogoo”  way deef  dummies does just then we see some  steve nickersons people coming  lived tother

let  we dont know you but any time we can  any help you just let us know” then we loafed along past  nickersons   course they asked if    new stranger yonder  whered  come from  what  his name  which

sometimes  speak out before  thought when we had watched long enough  see  jake  getting along all right  working his signs very good we loafed along again allowing  strike  schoolhouse about recess time which   threemile tramp i  so disappointed not  hear jake tell about  row   sycamores  how near  come  getting killed  i couldnt seem  get over it  tom  felt  same but said if we   jakes fix we

old jeff hooker  throwed cold water   whole business when we got  his blacksmith shop  told him what we come for “you can take  dog”  says “but you aint agoing  find any corpse because there aint any corpse  find everybodys quit looking  theyre right soon  they come  think they knowed there warnt no corpse and ill tell you  why what does  person kill another person for tom sawyeranswer me that” “why heer” “answer up you aint no fool what does  kill him for” “well sometimes its  revenge and” “wait one thing   time revenge says you  right you are now who ever had anything agin  poor trifling noaccount who do you reckon would want  kill himthat rabbit” tom  stuck i reckon  hadnt thought   person having  have  reason  killing  person before  now  sees  warnt likely anybody would have  much   grudge against  lamb like jubiter dunlap the blacksmith says   by “the revenge idea wont work you see well then whats next robbery bgosh  must a been it tom yes sirree i reckon weve struck  this time some feller wanted his gallusbuckles  so he” but   so funny  busted out laughing  just went  laughing  laughing  laughing till   most dead  tom looked so put out  cheap  i knowed   ashamed  had come   wished  hadnt but old hooker never let up  him he raked up everything  person ever could want  kill another person about  any fool could see they didnt any  them fit this case   just made no end  fun   whole business    people  had been hunting  body   said “if theyd had any sense theyd a knowed  lazy cuss slid out because  wanted  loafing spell after all this work hell come pottering back   couple

said “all right unchain him”   blacksmith done it  we started home  left  old man laughing yet it   lovely dog there aint any dog thats got  lovelier disposition than  bloodhound  this one knowed us  liked us he capered  raced around ever so friendly  powerful glad   free  have  holiday but tom  so cut up  couldnt take any intrust  him  said  wished hed stopped  thought  minute before  ever started  such  fool errand he said old jeff hooker would tell everybody  wed never hear  last  it so we loafed along home down  back lanes feeling pretty glum  not talking when we  passing  far corner  our tobacker field we heard  dog set up  long howl  there  we went   place    scratching  ground  all his might  every now  then canting up his head sideways  fetching another howl it   long square  shape   grave  rain had made  sink down  show  shape the minute we come  stood there we looked  one another  never said  word when  dog had dug down only  few inches  grabbed something  pulled  up     arm   sleeve tom kind  gasped out  says “come away huckits found” i just felt awful we struck   road  fetched  first men  come along they got  spade   crib  dug out  body  you never see such  excitement you couldnt make anything out   face but you didnt need to everybody said “poor jubiter its his clothes   last rag” some rushed off  spread  news  tell  justice   peace  have  inquest  me  tom lit out   house tom  all afire  most out  breath when we come tearing  where uncle silas  aunt sally  benny was tom sung out “me  hucks found jubiter dunlaps corpse all  ourselves   bloodhound after everybody else had quit hunting  given  up  if  hadnt  been  us  never would a been found   was murdered toothey done    club or something like that  im going  start   find  murderer next  i bet ill do it” aunt sally  benny sprung up pale  astonished but uncle silas fell right forward out  his chair    floor  groans out “oh my god youve found him now” chapter x the arrest of uncle silas them awful words froze us solid we couldnt move hand or foot   much  half  minute then we kind  come to  lifted  old man up  got him into his chair  benny petted him  kissed him  tried  comfort him  poor old aunt sally she done  same but poor things they  so broke up  scared  knocked out  their right minds  they didnt hardly know what they  about with tom   awful  most petrified him  think maybe  had got his uncle into  thousand times more trouble than ever  maybe  wouldnt ever happened if  hadnt been so ambitious  get celebrated  let  corpse alone  way  others done but pretty soon  sort  come  himself again  says “uncle silas dont you say another word like that its dangerous  there aint  shadder  truth  it” aunt sally  benny  thankful  hear him say that  they said  same but  old man  wagged his head sorrowful  hopeless   tears run down his face   says “noi done it poor jubiter i done it” it  dreadful  hear him say it then  went   told about it  said  happened  day me  tom comealong about sundown he said jubiter pestered him  aggravated him till   so mad  just sort  lost his mind  grabbed up  stick  hit him over  head  all his might  jubiter dropped  his tracks then   scared  sorry  got down  his knees  lifted his head up  begged him  speak  say  wasnt dead  before long  come to  when  see who   holding his head  jumped like   most scared  death  cleared  fence  tore into  woods   gone so  hoped  wasnt hurt bad “but laws”  says “it  only just fear  gave him  last little spurt  strength   course  soon played out   laid down   bush  there wasnt anybody  help him   died” then  old man cried  grieved  said    murderer   mark  cain   him   had disgraced his family   going   found out  hung but tom said “no you aint going   found out you didnt kill him one lick wouldnt kill him somebody else done it” “oh yes”  says “i done itnobody else who else had anything against him who else could have anything against him” he looked up kind  like  hoped some  us could mention somebody  could have  grudge against  harmless noaccount but  course  warnt no usehe had us we couldnt say  word he noticed that   saddened down again  i never see  face so miserable  so pitiful  see tom had  sudden idea  says “but hold onsomebody buried him now who” he shut off sudden i knowed  reason it give me  cold shudders when  said them words because right away i remembered about us seeing uncle silas prowling around   longhandled shovel away   night  night and i knowed benny seen him too because she  talking about  one day the minute tom shut off  changed  subject  went  begging uncle silas  keep mum   rest  us done  same  said  must  said  wasnt his business  tell  himself  if  kept mum nobody would ever know but if   found out  any harm come  him  would break  familys hearts  kill them  yet never do anybody any good so  last  promised we  all  us more comfortable then  went  work  cheer up  old man we told him all hed got  do   keep still   wouldnt  long till  whole thing would blow over   forgot we all said there wouldnt anybody ever suspect uncle silas nor ever dream  such  thing  being so good  kind  having such  good character  tom says cordial  hearty  says “why just look    minute just consider here  uncle silas all these years  preacherat his own expense all these years doing good  all his might  every way  can think ofat his own expense all  time always been loved  everybody  respected always been peaceable  minding his own business  very last man  this whole deestrict  touch  person  everybody knows it suspect him why  aint any more possible than” “by authority   state  arkansaw i arrest you   murder  jubiter dunlap” shouts  sheriff   door it  awful aunt sally  benny flung themselves  uncle silas screaming  crying  hugged him  hung  him  aunt sally said go away she wouldnt ever give him up they shouldnt have him   niggers they come crowding  crying   door andwell i couldnt stand it   enough  break  persons heart so i got out they took him up   little onehorse jail   village  we all went along  tell him goodbye  tom  feeling elegant  says  me “well have  most noble good time  heaps  danger some dark night getting him out  there huck  itll  talked about everywheres  we   celebrated” but  old man busted  scheme up  minute  whispered  him about it he said no   his duty  stand whatever  law done  him   would stick   jail plumb through   end even if there warnt no door  it it disappointed tom  graveled him  good deal but  had  put up  it but  felt responsible  bound  get his uncle silas free   told aunt sally  last thing not  worry because   going  turn   work night  day  beat this game  fetch uncle silas out innocent  she  very loving  him  thanked him  said she knowed  would do his very best and she told us  help benny take care   house   children  then we had  goodbye cry all around  went back   farm  left her there  live   jailers wife  month till  trial  october chapter xi tom sawyer discovers the murderers well    hard month  us all poor benny she kept up  best she could  me  tom tried  keep things cheerful there   house but  kind  went  nothing  you may say it   same up   jail we went up every day  see  old people but   awful dreary because  old man warnt sleeping much   walking  his sleep considerable  so  got  looking fagged  miserable  his mind got shaky  we all got afraid his troubles would break him down  kill him and whenever we tried  persuade him  feel cheerfuler  only shook his head  said if we only knowed what    carry around  murderers load  your heart we wouldnt talk  way tom  all  us kept telling him  wasnt murder but just accidental killing but  never made any differenceit  murder   wouldnt have  any other way he actuly begun  come out plain  square towards trial time  acknowledge   tried  kill  man why   awful you know it made things seem fifty times  dreadful  there warnt no more comfort  aunt sally  benny but  promised  wouldnt say  word about his murder when others  around  we  glad  that tom sawyer racked  head off  himself all  month trying  plan some way out  uncle silas  manys  night  kept me up most all night  this kind  tiresome work but  couldnt seem  get   right track no way as  me i reckoned  body might  well give  up  all looked so blue  i  so downhearted but  wouldnt he stuck   business right along  went  planning  thinking  ransacking his head so  last  trial come on towards  middle  october  we  all   court the place  jammed  course poor old uncle silas  looked more like  dead person than  live one his eyes  so hollow   looked so thin  so mournful benny she set  one side  him  aunt sally   other  they had veils on   full  trouble but tom  set  our lawyer  had his finger  everywheres  course the lawyer let him   judge let him he most took  business out   lawyers hands sometimes which  well enough because   only  mudturtle   backsettlement lawyer  didnt know enough  come  when  rains   saying is they swore   jury  then  lawyer   prostitution got up  begun he made  terrible speech against  old man  made him moan  groan  made benny  aunt sally cry the way he told about  murder kind  knocked us all stupid   so different   old mans tale he said   going  prove  uncle silas  seen  kill jubiter dunlap  two good witnesses  done  deliberate  said   going  kill him  very minute  hit him   club  they seen him hide jubiter   bushes  they seen  jubiter  stonedead and said uncle silas come later  lugged jubiter down into  tobacker field  two men seen him do it and said uncle silas turned out away   night  buried jubiter   man seen him  it i says  myself poor old uncle silas  been lying about  because  reckoned nobody seen him   couldnt bear  break aunt sallys heart  bennys  right  was   me i would a lied  same way  so would anybody  had any feeling  save them such misery  sorrow which they warnt no ways responsible for well  made our lawyer look pretty sick   knocked tom silly too   little spell but then  braced up  let    warnt worriedbut i knowed  was all  same and  peoplemy but  made  stir amongst them and when  lawyer  done telling  jury what   going  prove  set down  begun  work his witnesses first  called  lot  them  show  there  bad blood betwixt uncle silas   diseased  they told how they had heard uncle silas threaten  diseased  one time  another  how  got worse  worse  everybody  talking about it  how diseased got afraid  his life  told two or three  them   certain uncle silas would up  kill him some time or another tom  our lawyer asked them some questions but  warnt no use they stuck  what they said next they called up lem beebe   took  stand it come into my mind then how lem  jim lane had come along talking  time about borrowing  dog or something  jubiter dunlap   brought up  blackberries   lantern   brought up bill  jack withers  how they passed by talking about  nigger stealing uncle silass corn   fetched up our old ghost  come along about  same time  scared us soand here he  too   privileged character  accounts  his being deef  dumb   stranger  they had fixed him  chair inside  railing where  could cross his legs   comfortable whilst  other people  all   jam so they couldnt hardly breathe so  all come back  me just  way    day   made me mournful  think how pleasant   up  then  how miserable ever since lem beebe sworn said“i  acoming along  day second  september  jim lane   me    towards sundown  we heard loud talk like quarrelling  we  very close only  hazel bushes between thats along  fence  we heard  voice say ive told you moren once id kill you  knowed   this prisoners voice  then we see  club come up above  bushes  down out  sight again  heard  smashing thump  then  groan or two  then we crope soft  where we could see  there laid jupiter dunlap dead  this prisoner standing over him   club   next  hauled  dead man into  clump  bushes  hid him  then we stooped low   out  sight  got away” well   awful it kind  froze everybodys blood  hear it   house  most  still whilst   telling   if there warnt nobody  it and when   done you could hear them gasp  sigh all over  house  look  one another  same   say “aint  perfectly terribleaint  awful” now happened  thing  astonished me all  time  first witnesses  proving  bad blood   threats  all that tom sawyer  alive  laying  them   minute they  through  went  them  done his level best  catch them  lies  spile their testimony but now how different when lem first begun  talk  never said anything about speaking  jubiter or trying  borrow  dog off  him   all alive  laying  lem  you could see   getting ready  crossquestion him  death pretty soon  then i judged him  me would go   stand     tell what we heard him  jim lane say but  next time i looked  tom i got  cold shivers why     brownest study you ever seemiles  miles away he warnt hearing  word lem beebe  saying  when  got through   still   brownstudy just  same our lawyer joggled him  then  looked up startled  says “take  witness if you want him lemme alonei want  think” well  beat me i couldnt understand it and benny  her motheroh they looked sick they  so troubled they shoved their veils  one side  tried  get his eye but  warnt any use  i couldnt get his eye either so  mudturtle  tackled  witness but  didnt amount  nothing   made  mess  it then they called up jim lane   told  very same story over again exact tom never listened  this one  all but set there thinking  thinking miles  miles away so  mudturtle went  alone again  come out just  flat   done before the lawyer   prostitution looked very comfortable but  judge looked disgusted you see tom  just  same   regular lawyer nearly because   arkansaw law   prisoner  choose anybody  wanted  help his lawyer  tom had had uncle silas shove him into  case  now   botching   you could see  judge didnt like  much all   mudturtle got out  lem  jim  this  asked them “why didnt you go  tell what you saw” “we  afraid we would get mixed up   ourselves and we  just starting down  river ahunting  all  week besides but  soon  we come back we found out theyd been searching   body so then we went  told brace dunlap all about it” “when  that” “saturday night september th” the judge  spoke up  says “mr sheriff arrest these two witnesses  suspicions  being accessionary after  fact   murder” the lawyer   prostitution jumps up all excited  says “your honor i protest against this extraordi” “set down” says  judge pulling his bowie  laying   his pulpit “i beg you  respect  court” so  done it then  called bill withers bill withers sworn said “i  coming along about sundown saturday september d   prisoners field  my brother jack   me  we seen  man toting off something heavy  his back  allowed    nigger stealing corn we couldnt see distinct next we made out    one man carrying another   way  hung so kind  limp we judged   somebody   drunk    mans walk we said   parson silas  we judged  had found sam cooper drunk   road which   always trying  reform him   toting him out  danger” it made  people shiver  think  poor old uncle silas toting off  diseased down   place  his tobacker field where  dog dug up  body but there warnt much sympathy around amongst  faces  i heard one cuss say “tis  coldest blooded work i ever struck lugging  murdered man around like that  going  bury him like  animal  him  preacher  that” tom  went  thinking  never took no notice so our lawyer took  witness  done  best  could    plenty poor enough then jack withers  come   stand  told  same tale just like bill done and after him comes brace dunlap    looking very mournful  most crying  there   rustle   stir all around  everybody got ready  listen  lots   women folks said “poor cretur poor cretur”  you could see  many  them wiping their eyes brace dunlap sworn said “i   considerable trouble  long time about my poor brother but i reckoned things warnt near so bad   made out  i couldnt make myself believe anybody would have  heart  hurt  poor harmless cretur like that”by jings i  sure i seen tom give  kind   faint little start  then look disappointed again“and you know i couldnt think  preacher would hurt himit warnt natural  think such  onlikely thingso i never paid much attention  now i shant ever ever forgive myself  if i had  done different my poor brother would   me this day  not laying yonder murdered  him so harmless” he kind  broke down there  choked up  waited  get his voice  people all around said  most pitiful things  women cried    very still  there  solemn  old uncle silas poor thing  give  groan right out so everybody heard him then brace  went on “saturday september d  didnt come home  supper byandby i got  little uneasy  one  my niggers went over  this prisoners place but come back  said  warnt there so i got uneasier  uneasier  couldnt rest i went  bed but i couldnt sleep  turned out away late   night  went wandering over  this prisoners place  all around about there  good while hoping i would run across my poor brother  never knowing   out  his troubles  gone   better shore” so  broke down  choked up again  most all  women  crying now pretty soon  got another start  says “but  warnt no use so  last i went home  tried  get some sleep but couldnt well   day or two everybody  uneasy  they got  talking about this prisoners threats  took   idea which i didnt take no stock in  my brother  murdered so they hunted around  tried  find his body but couldnt  give  up and so i reckoned   gone off somers  have  little peace  would come back  us when his troubles  kind  healed but late saturday night  th lem beebe  jim lane come  my house  told me alltold me  whole awful sassination  my heart  broke and then i remembered something  hadnt took no hold  me   time because reports said this prisoner had took  walking  his sleep  doing all kind  things  no consequence not knowing what   about i  tell you what  thing   come back into my memory away late  awful saturday night when i  wandering around about this prisoners place grieving  troubled i  down   corner   tobackerfield  i heard  sound like digging   gritty soil  i crope nearer  peeped through  vines  hung   rail fence  seen this prisoner shovelingshoveling   longhandled shovelheaving earth into  big hole   most filled up his back   me but   bright moonlight  i knowed him  his old green baize workgown   splattery white patch   middle   back like somebody had hit him   snowball he was burying the man hed murdered” and  slumped down  his chair crying  sobbing  most everybody   house busted out wailing  crying  saying “oh its awfulawfulhorrible”  there   most tremendous excitement  you couldnt hear yourself think  right   midst   up jumps old uncle silas white   sheet  sings out “its true every wordi murdered him in cold blood” by jackson  petrified them people rose up wild all over  house straining  staring   better look  him   judge  hammering  his mallet   sheriff yelling “orderorder   courtorder” and all  while  old man stood there aquaking  his eyes aburning  not looking  his wife  daughter which  clinging  him  begging him  keep still but pawing them off  his hands  saying  would clear his black soul  crime  would heave off this load   more than  could bear   wouldnt bear  another hour and then  raged right along  his awful tale everybody astaring  gasping judge jury lawyers  everybody  benny  aunt sally crying their hearts out and  george tom sawyer never looked  him once never oncejust set there gazing  all his eyes  something else i couldnt tell what and so  old man raged right along pouring his words out like  stream  fire “i killed him i am guilty but i never had  notion  my life  hurt him or harm him spite  all them lies about my threatening him till  very minute i raised  clubthen my heart went coldthen  pity all went out  it  i struck  kill in  one moment all my wrongs come into my mind all  insults   man   scoundrel his brother there had put upon me  how they laid  together  ruin me   people  take away my good

their sakes  i did hide  corpse   bushes  presently i carried    tobacker field    deep night i went  my shovel  buried  where” up jumps tom  shouts “now ive got it”  waves his hand oh ever so fine  starchy towards  old man  says “set down a murder was done but you never had no hand  it” well sir you could  heard  pin drop and  old man  sunk down kind  bewildered  his seat  aunt sally  benny didnt know it because they  so astonished  staring  tom  their mouths open  not knowing what they  about and  whole house  same i never seen people look so helpless  tangled up  i haint ever seen eyes bug out  gaze without  blink  way theirn did tom says perfectly cam “your honor may i speak” “for gods sake yesgo on” says  judge so astonished  mixed up  didnt know what   about hardly then tom  stood there  waited  second or twothat    work up  “effect”   calls itthen  started  just  cam  ever  says “for about two weeks now theres been  little bill sticking   front  this courthouse offering

kind  things about him   graduly broke his heartyes    so worried  distressed  often  warnt hardly  his right mind “well   saturday  weve had so much trouble about two  these witnesses here lem beebe  jim lane come along  where uncle silas  jubiter dunlap   workand  much  what theyve said  true  rest  lies they didnt hear uncle silas say  would kill jubiter they didnt hear no blow struck they didnt

saturday evening bill  jack withers did see one man lugging off another one that much  what they said  true   rest  lies first off they thought    nigger stealing uncle silass cornyou notice  makes

they knowed  when they swore   lie “a man out   moonlight did see  murdered person put under ground   tobacker fieldbut  wasnt uncle silas  done  burying he   his bed   very time “now then before i go

cheek or under their chin or  their under lip thats my way when im restless or worried or thinking hard i draw capital vs  my cheek or  my under lip or under my chin  never anything but capital vsand half  time i dont notice   dont know im doing it” that  odd that  just what i do only i make  o and i could see people nodding  one another same  they do when they mean “thats so” “now then ill go on that same saturdayno    night beforethere   steamboat laying  flaglers landing forty miles above here    raining  storming like  nation and there   thief aboard   had them two big dimonds thats

down  uncle silass field   went  there  get  disguise out  his handbag  put   before  showed himself here   townand mind you  done  just  little after  time  uncle silas  hitting jubiter dunlap over  head   clubfor  did hit him “but  minute  pals see  thief slide into  bunch  sycamores they jumped out   bushes  slid  after him “they fell  him  clubbed him  death “yes  all  screamed  howled so they never had no mercy  him but clubbed him  death and two men   running along  road heard him yelling  way  they made  rush into  sycamore bunchwhich  where they  bound for anywayand when  pals saw them they lit out   two new men after them achasing them  tight  they could go but only  minute or twothen these two new men slipped back very quiet into  sycamores “then what did they do i  tell you what they done they found where  thief had got his disguise out  his carpetsack  put on so one  them strips  puts   disguise” tom waited  little here  some more “effect”then  says very deliberate “the man  put   dead mans disguise wasjubiter dunlap” “great scott” everybody shouted all over  house  old uncle silas  looked perfectly astonished “yes   jubiter dunlap not dead you see then they pulled off  dead mans boots  put jubiter dunlaps old ragged shoes   corpse  put  corpses boots  jubiter dunlap then jubiter dunlap stayed where  was   other man lugged  dead body off   twilight  after midnight

kissing  smothering old uncle silas   degree   more muddled  confused  mushed up  his mind than  ever  before    saying considerable and next people begun  yell “tom sawyer tom sawyer shut up everybody  let him go on go on tom sawyer” which made him feel uncommon bully    nuts  tom sawyer    public character thataway   hero   calls it so when   all quiet  says “there aint much left only this when  man there bruce dunlap had most worried  life  sense out  uncle silas till  last  plumb lost his mind  hit this other blatherskite his brother   club i reckon  seen his chance jubiter broke   woods  hide  i reckon  game   him  slide out   night  leave  country then brace would make everybody believe uncle silas killed him  hid his body somers   would ruin uncle silas  drive him out   countryhang him maybe i dunno but when they found their dead brother   sycamores without knowing him because   so battered up they see they had  better thing disguise both  bury jake  dig him up presently all dressed up  jubiters clothes  hire jim lane  bill withers   others  swear  some handy lieswhich they done and there they set now  i told them they would  looking sick before i got done     way theyre looking now “well me  huck finn here we come down   boat   thieves   dead one told us all about  dimonds  said  others would murder him if they got  chance  we  going  help him all we could we  bound   sycamores when we heard them killing him  there but we   there   early morning after  storm  allowed nobody hadnt been killed after all and when we see jubiter dunlap here spreading around   very same disguise jake told us he  going  wear we thought   jake his own selfand   googooing deef  dumb  that  according  agreement “well me  huck went  hunting   corpse after  others quit  we found it and  proud too but uncle silas  knocked us crazy  telling us he killed  man so we  mighty sorry we found  body   bound  save uncle silass neck if we could    going   tough work too because  wouldnt let us break him out  prison  way we done  our old nigger jim “i done everything i could  whole month  think up some way  save uncle silas but i couldnt strike  thing so when we come into court today i come empty  couldnt see no chance anywheres but    i had  glimpse  something  set me thinkingjust  little wee glimpseonly that  not enough  make sure but  set me thinking hardand watching when i  only letting   think    by sure enough when uncle silas  piling out  stuff about him killing jubiter dunlap i catched  glimpse again  this time i jumped up  shut down  proceedings because i knowed jubiter dunlap  asetting here before me i knowed him   thing which i seen him doand i remembered it id seen him do  when i  here  year ago” he stopped then  studied  minutelaying   “effect”i knowed  perfectly well then  turned off like   going  leave  platform  says kind  lazy  indifferent “well i believe   all” why you never heard such  howland  come   whole house “what was  you seen him do stay where you are you little devil you think you  going  work  body up till his mouths awatering  stop there what was   done” that  it you seehe just done   get  “effect” you couldnt a pulled him off   platform   yoke  oxen “oh  wasnt anything much”  says “i seen him looking  little excited when  found uncle silas  actually fixing  hang himself   murder  warnt ever done   got more  more nervous  worried i awatching him sharp but not seeming  look  himand all   sudden his hands begun  work  fidget  pretty soon his left crept up  his finger drawed a cross on his cheek  then i had him” well then they ripped  howled  stomped  clapped their hands till tom sawyer   proud  happy  didnt know what  do  himself and then  judge  looked down over his pulpit  says “my boy did you see all  various details  this strange conspiracy  tragedy  youve been describing” “no your honor i didnt see any  them” “didnt see any  them why youve told  whole history straight through just  same  if youd seen   your eyes how did you manage that” tom says kind  easy  comfortable “oh just noticing  evidence  piecing this   together your honor just  ordinary little bit  detective work anybody could a done it” “nothing   kind not two   million could a done it you   very remarkable boy” then they let go  give tom another smashing round  hewell  wouldnt a sold out   silver mine then  judge says “but  you certain youve got this curious history straight” “perfectly your honor here  brace dunlaplet him deny his share   if  wants  take  chance ill engage  make him wish  hadnt said anything well you see hes pretty quiet and his brothers pretty quiet  them four witnesses  lied so  got paid  it theyre pretty quiet and   uncle silas  aint any use  him  put  his oar i wouldnt believe him under oath” well sir  fairly made them shout  even  judge  let go  laughed tom   just feeling like  rainbow when they  done laughing  looks up   judge  says “your honor theres  thief  this house” “a thief” “yes sir and hes got them twelvethousanddollar dimonds  him” by gracious but  made  stir everybody went shouting “which  him which  him pint him out” and  judge says “point him out my lad sheriff you  arrest him which one  it” tom says “this late dead man herejubiter dunlap” then there  another thundering letgo  astonishment  excitement but jubiter which  astonished enough before  just fairly putrified  astonishment this time and  spoke up about half crying  says “now thats  lie your honor  aint fair im plenty bad enough without that i done  other thingsbrace  put me up  it  persuaded me  promised hed make me rich some day  i done it  im sorry i done it  i wisht i hadnt but i haint stole no dimonds  i haint got no dimonds i wisht i may never stir if  aint so the sheriff can search me  see” tom says “your honor  wasnt right  call him  thief  ill let up    little he did steal  dimonds but  didnt know it he stole them  his brother jake when   laying dead after jake had stole them   other thieves but jubiter didnt know   stealing them  hes been swelling around here  them  month yes sir twelve thousand dollars worth  dimonds  himall  riches  going around here every day just like  poor man yes your honor hes got them  him now” the judge spoke up  says “search him sheriff” well sir  sheriff  ransacked him high  low  everywhere searched his hat socks seams boots everythingand tom  stood there quiet laying  another  them effects  hisn finally  sheriff  give  up  everybody looked disappointed  jubiter says “there now whatd i tell you” and  judge says “it appears you  mistaken this time my boy” then tom took  attitude  let    studying  all his might  scratching his head then all   sudden  glanced up chipper  says “oh now ive got it id forgot” which   lie  i knowed it then  says “will somebody  good enough  lend me  little small screwdriver there  one  your brothers handbag  you smouched jubiter but i reckon you didnt fetch   you” “no i didnt i didnt want it  i give  away” “thats because you didnt know what   for” jubiter had his boots  again  now  when  thing tom wanted  passed over  peoples heads till  got  him  says  jubiter “put up your foot  this chair” and  kneeled down  begun  unscrew  heelplate everybody watching  when  got  big dimond out   bootheel  held  up  let  flash  blaze  squirt sunlight everwhichaway  just took everybodys breath  jubiter  looked so sick  sorry you never see  like  it and when tom held up  other dimond  looked sorrier than ever land   thinking how  would a skipped out  been rich  independent   foreign land if hed only had  luck  guess what  screwdriver    carpetbag for well    most exciting time take  all around  tom got cords  glory the judge took  dimonds  stood up  his pulpit  cleared his throat  shoved his spectacles back  his head  says “ill keep them  notify  owners  when they send  them     real pleasure  me  hand you  two thousand dollars  youve earned  moneyyes  youve earned  deepest  most sincerest thanks  this community besides  lifting  wronged  innocent family out  ruin  shame  saving  good  honorable man   felons death   exposing  infamy   punishment   law  cruel  odious scoundrel  his miserable creatures” well sir if thered been  brass band  bust out some music then  would a been just  perfectest thing i ever see  tom sawyer  said  same then  sheriff  nabbed brace dunlap  his crowd     next month  judge had them up  trial  jailed  whole lot and everybody crowded back  uncle silass little old church   ever so loving  kind  him   family  couldnt do enough  them  uncle silas  preached them  blamedest jumbledest idiotic sermons you ever struck  would tangle you up so you couldnt find your way home  daylight but  people never let  but what they thought    clearest  brightest  elegantest sermons  ever was  they would set there  cry  love  pity but  george they give me  jimjams   fantods  caked up what brains i had  turned them solid but    they loved  old mans intellects back into him again     sound  his skull  ever  was which aint no flattery i reckon and so  whole family   happy  birds  nobody could  gratefuler  lovinger than what they   tom sawyer   same  me though i hadnt done nothing and when  two thousand dollars come tom give half    me  never told anybody so which didnt surprise me because i knowed him end   project gutenberg ebook  tom sawyer
