ghost marley  dead  begin with there  no doubt whatever about that the register  his burial  signed   clergyman  clerk  undertaker   chief mourner scrooge signed it  scrooges name  good upon change  anything  chose  put his hand to old marley   dead   doornail mind i dont mean  say  i know  my own knowledge what there  particularly dead about  doornail i might have been inclined myself  regard  coffinnail   deadest piece  ironmongery   trade but  wisdom  our ancestors    simile  my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it or  countrys done for you  therefore permit me  repeat emphatically  marley   dead   doornail scrooge knew   dead of course  did how could   otherwise scrooge    partners  i dont know how many years scrooge  his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend  sole mourner and even scrooge  not so dreadfully cut up   sad event but     excellent man  business   very day   funeral  solemnised    undoubted bargain the mention  marleys funeral brings me back   point i started from there  no doubt  marley  dead this must  distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come   story i am going  relate if we  not perfectly convinced  hamlets father died before  play began there would  nothing more remarkable  his taking  stroll  night   easterly wind upon his own ramparts than there would   any other middleaged gentleman rashly turning out after dark   breezy spotsay saint pauls churchyard  instance literally  astonish his sons weak mind scrooge never painted out old marleys name there  stood years afterwards above  warehouse door scrooge  marley the firm  known  scrooge  marley sometimes people new   business called scrooge scrooge  sometimes marley but  answered  both names it  all  same  him oh but    tightfisted hand   grindstone scrooge  squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner hard  sharp  flint  which no steel had ever struck out generous fire secret  selfcontained  solitary   oyster the cold within him froze his old features nipped his pointed nose shrivelled his cheek stiffened his gait made his eyes red his thin lips blue  spoke out shrewdly  his grating voice a frosty rime   his head   his eyebrows  his wiry chin he carried his own low temperature always about  him  iced his office   dogdays  didnt thaw  one degree  christmas external heat  cold had little influence  scrooge no warmth could warm no wintry weather chill him no wind  blew  bitterer than he no falling snow  more intent upon  purpose no pelting rain less open  entreaty foul weather didnt know where  have him the heaviest rain  snow  hail  sleet could boast   advantage over him  only one respect they often came down handsomely  scrooge never did nobody ever stopped him   street  say  gladsome looks my dear scrooge how  you when  you come  see me no beggars implored him  bestow  trifle no children asked him what   oclock no man or woman ever once  all his life inquired  way  such  such  place  scrooge even  blind mens dogs appeared  know him  when they saw him coming on would tug their owners into doorways  up courts  then would wag their tails  though they said no eye  all  better than  evil eye dark master but what did scrooge care it   very thing  liked to edge his way along  crowded paths  life warning all human sympathy  keep  distance  what  knowing ones call nuts  scrooge once upon  timeof all  good days   year  christmas eveold scrooge sat busy  his countinghouse it  cold bleak biting weather foggy withal   could hear  people   court outside go wheezing up  down beating their hands upon their breasts  stamping their feet upon  pavement stones  warm them the city clocks had only just gone three but   quite dark already  had not been light all dayand candles  flaring   windows   neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon  palpable brown air the fog came pouring   every chink  keyhole   so dense without  although  court    narrowest  houses opposite  mere phantoms to see  dingy cloud come drooping down obscuring everything one might have thought  nature lived hard by   brewing   large scale the door  scrooges countinghouse  open   might keep his eye upon his clerk who   dismal little cell beyond  sort  tank  copying letters scrooge had  very small fire but  clerks fire  so very much smaller   looked like one coal but  couldnt replenish it  scrooge kept  coalbox  his own room  so surely   clerk came    shovel  master predicted   would  necessary  them  part wherefore  clerk put  his white comforter  tried  warm himself   candle  which effort not being  man   strong imagination  failed a merry christmas uncle god save you cried  cheerful voice it   voice  scrooges nephew who came upon him so quickly  this   first intimation  had  his approach bah said scrooge humbug he had so heated himself  rapid walking   fog  frost this nephew  scrooges    all   glow his face  ruddy  handsome his eyes sparkled  his breath smoked again christmas  humbug uncle said scrooges nephew you dont mean that i am sure i do said scrooge merry christmas what right have you   merry what reason have you   merry youre poor enough come then returned  nephew gaily what right have you   dismal what reason have you   morose youre rich enough scrooge having no better answer ready   spur   moment said bah again  followed  up  humbug dont  cross uncle said  nephew what else can i be returned  uncle when i live  such  world  fools  this merry christmas out upon merry christmas whats christmas time  you but  time  paying bills without money  time  finding yourself  year older but not  hour richer  time  balancing your books  having every item  em through  round dozen  months presented dead against you if i could work my will said scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about  merry christmas  his lips should  boiled  his own pudding  buried   stake  holly through his heart he should uncle pleaded  nephew nephew returned  uncle sternly keep christmas  your own way  let me keep   mine keep it repeated scrooges nephew but you dont keep it let me leave  alone then said scrooge much good may  do you much good   ever done you there  many things  which i might have derived good  which i have not profited i dare say returned  nephew christmas among  rest but i am sure i have always thought  christmas time when   come roundapart   veneration due   sacred name  origin if anything belonging   can  apart  thatas  good time  kind forgiving charitable pleasant time  only time i know of   long calendar   year when men  women seem  one consent  open their shutup hearts freely   think  people below them  if they really  fellowpassengers   grave  not another race  creatures bound  other journeys and therefore uncle though   never put  scrap  gold or silver  my pocket i believe    done me good   do me good  i say god bless it the clerk   tank involuntarily applauded becoming immediately sensible   impropriety  poked  fire  extinguished  last frail spark  ever let me hear another sound  you said scrooge and youll keep your christmas  losing your situation youre quite  powerful speaker sir  added turning  his nephew i wonder you dont go into parliament dont  angry uncle come dine  us tomorrow scrooge said   would see himyes indeed  did he went  whole length   expression  said   would see him   extremity first but why cried scrooges nephew why why did you get married said scrooge because i fell  love because you fell  love growled scrooge  if    only one

scrooge or mr marley mr marley  been dead these seven years scrooge replied he died seven years ago this very night we have no doubt his liberality  well represented  his surviving partner said  gentleman presenting his credentials it certainly was  they had been two kindred spirits at  ominous word liberality scrooge frowned  shook his head  handed  credentials back at this festive season   year mr scrooge said  gentleman taking up  pen it  more than usually desirable  we should make some slight provision   poor  destitute who suffer greatly   present time many thousands   want  common

 not  interfere  other peoples mine occupies me constantly good afternoon gentlemen seeing clearly   would  useless  pursue their point  gentlemen withdrew scrooge resumed his labours   improved

countinghouse arrived with  illwill scrooge dismounted  his stool  tacitly admitted  fact   expectant clerk   tank who instantly snuffed his candle out  put  his hat youll want all day tomorrow i suppose said scrooge if quite convenient sir its not convenient said scrooge and its not fair if i   stop halfacrown  it youd think yourself illused ill  bound the clerk smiled faintly and yet said scrooge you dont think me illused when i pay  days wages  no work the clerk observed    only once  year a poor excuse  picking  mans pocket every twentyfifth  december said scrooge buttoning his greatcoat   chin but i suppose you must have  whole day be here all  earlier next morning the clerk promised   would  scrooge walked out   growl the office  closed   twinkling   clerk   long ends  his

pelt  play  blindmansbuff scrooge took his melancholy dinner  his usual melancholy tavern  having read all  newspapers  beguiled  rest   evening  his bankersbook went home  bed he lived  chambers which had once belonged  his deceased partner they   gloomy suite  rooms   lowering pile  building up  yard where  had so little business  be  one could scarcely help fancying  must have run there when    young house playing  hideandseek  other houses  forgotten  way out again it  old enough now  dreary enough  nobody lived   but scrooge  other rooms being all let out  offices the yard  so dark  even scrooge who knew  every stone  fain  grope  his hands the fog  frost so hung about  black old gateway   house   seemed  if  genius   weather sat  mournful meditation   threshold now    fact  there  nothing  all particular about  knocker   door except    very large it  also  fact  scrooge had seen it night  morning during his whole residence   place also  scrooge had  little  what  called fancy about him  any man   city  london even includingwhich   bold wordthe corporation aldermen  livery let  also  borne  mind  scrooge had not bestowed one thought  marley since his last mention  his seven years dead partner  afternoon and then let any man explain  me if  can how  happened  scrooge having his key   lock   door saw   knocker without  undergoing any intermediate process  changenot  knocker but marleys face marleys face it  not  impenetrable shadow   other objects   yard were but had  dismal light about it like  bad lobster   dark cellar it  not angry or ferocious but looked  scrooge  marley used  look  ghostly spectacles turned up   ghostly forehead the hair  curiously stirred  if  breath or hot air and though  eyes  wide open they  perfectly motionless that   livid colour made  horrible but  horror seemed    spite   face  beyond  control rather than  part   own expression as scrooge looked fixedly  this phenomenon    knocker again to say    not startled or  his blood  not conscious   terrible sensation  which  had been  stranger  infancy would  untrue but  put his hand upon  key  had relinquished turned  sturdily walked in  lighted his candle he did pause   moments irresolution before  shut  door   did look cautiously behind  first  if  half expected   terrified   sight  marleys pigtail sticking out into  hall but there  nothing   back   door except  screws  nuts  held  knocker on so  said pooh pooh  closed    bang the sound resounded through  house like thunder every room above  every cask   winemerchants cellars below appeared  have  separate peal  echoes   own scrooge  not  man   frightened  echoes he fastened  door  walked across  hall  up  stairs slowly too trimming his candle   went you may talk vaguely about driving  coachandsix up  good old flight  stairs or through  bad young act  parliament but i mean  say you might have got  hearse up  staircase  taken  broadwise   splinterbar towards  wall   door towards  balustrades  done  easy there  plenty  width  that  room  spare which  perhaps  reason why scrooge thought  saw  locomotive hearse going  before him   gloom halfadozen gaslamps out   street wouldnt have lighted  entry too well so you may suppose    pretty dark  scrooges dip up scrooge went not caring  button  that darkness  cheap  scrooge liked it but before  shut his heavy door  walked through his rooms  see  all  right he had just enough recollection   face  desire  do that sittingroom bedroom lumberroom all  they should be nobody under  table nobody under  sofa  small fire   grate spoon  basin ready   little saucepan  gruel scrooge had  cold  his head upon  hob nobody under  bed nobody   closet nobody  his dressinggown which  hanging up   suspicious attitude against  wall lumberroom  usual old fireguard old shoes two fishbaskets washingstand  three legs   poker quite satisfied  closed his door  locked himself in doublelocked himself in which  not his custom thus secured against surprise  took off his cravat put  his dressinggown  slippers  his nightcap  sat down before  fire  take his gruel it   very low fire indeed nothing  such  bitter night he  obliged  sit close  it  brood over it before  could extract  least sensation  warmth  such  handful  fuel the fireplace   old one built  some dutch merchant long ago  paved all round  quaint dutch tiles designed  illustrate  scriptures there  cains  abels pharaohs daughters queens  sheba angelic messengers descending through  air  clouds like featherbeds abrahams belshazzars apostles putting off  sea  butterboats hundreds  figures  attract his thoughts  yet  face  marley seven years dead came like  ancient prophets rod  swallowed up  whole if each smooth tile had been  blank  first  power  shape some picture   surface   disjointed fragments  his thoughts there would have been  copy  old marleys head  every one humbug said scrooge  walked across  room after several turns  sat down again as  threw his head back   chair his glance happened  rest upon  bell  disused bell  hung   room  communicated  some purpose now forgotten   chamber   highest story   building it   great astonishment    strange inexplicable dread    looked  saw this bell begin  swing it swung so softly   outset   scarcely made  sound but soon  rang out loudly  so did every bell   house this might have lasted half  minute or  minute but  seemed  hour the bells ceased  they had begun together they  succeeded   clanking noise deep down below  if some person  dragging  heavy chain over  casks   winemerchants cellar scrooge then remembered  have heard  ghosts  haunted houses  described  dragging chains the cellardoor flew open   booming sound  then  heard  noise much louder   floors below then coming up  stairs then coming straight towards his door its humbug still said scrooge i wont believe it his colour changed though when without  pause  came  through  heavy door  passed into  room before his eyes upon  coming in  dying flame leaped up  though  cried i know him marleys ghost  fell again the same face  very same marley  his pigtail usual waistcoat tights  boots  tassels   latter bristling like his pigtail  his coatskirts   hair upon his head the chain  drew  clasped about his middle it  long  wound about him like  tail    made for scrooge observed  closely  cashboxes keys padlocks ledgers deeds  heavy purses wrought  steel his body  transparent so  scrooge observing him  looking through his waistcoat could see  two buttons  his coat behind scrooge had often heard  said  marley had no bowels but  had never believed  until now no nor did  believe  even now though  looked  phantom through  through  saw  standing before him though  felt  chilling influence   deathcold eyes  marked  very texture   folded kerchief bound about  head  chin which wrapper  had not observed before   still incredulous  fought against his senses how now said scrooge caustic  cold  ever what do you want  me muchmarleys voice no doubt about it who  you ask me who i was who  you then said scrooge raising his voice youre particular   shade he  going  say to  shade but substituted this  more appropriate in life i  your partner jacob marley can youcan you sit down asked scrooge looking doubtfully  him i can do it then scrooge asked  question because  didnt know whether  ghost so transparent might find himself   condition  take  chair  felt    event   being impossible  might involve  necessity   embarrassing explanation but  ghost sat down   opposite side   fireplace  if   quite used  it you dont believe  me observed  ghost i dont said scrooge what evidence would you have  my reality beyond   your senses i dont know said scrooge why do you doubt your senses because said scrooge a little thing affects them a slight disorder   stomach makes them cheats you may   undigested bit  beef  blot  mustard  crumb  cheese  fragment   underdone potato theres more  gravy than  grave about you whatever you are scrooge  not much   habit  cracking jokes nor did  feel  his heart  any means waggish then the truth is   tried   smart   means  distracting his own attention  keeping down his terror   spectres voice disturbed  very marrow  his bones to sit staring  those fixed glazed eyes  silence   moment would play scrooge felt  very deuce  him there  something very awful too   spectres being provided   infernal atmosphere   own scrooge could not feel  himself but this  clearly  case  though  ghost sat perfectly motionless  hair  skirts  tassels  still agitated    hot vapour   oven you see this toothpick said scrooge returning quickly   charge   reason just assigned  wishing though   only   second  divert  visions stony gaze  himself i do replied  ghost you  not looking  it said scrooge but i see it said  ghost notwithstanding well returned scrooge i have but  swallow this     rest  my days persecuted   legion  goblins all  my own creation humbug i tell you humbug at this  spirit raised  frightful cry  shook  chain  such  dismal  appalling noise  scrooge held  tight  his chair  save himself  falling   swoon but how much greater  his horror when  phantom taking off  bandage round  head  if   too warm  wear indoors  lower jaw dropped down upon  breast scrooge fell upon his knees  clasped his hands before his face mercy  said dreadful apparition why do you trouble me man   worldly mind replied  ghost do you believe  me or not i do said scrooge i must but why do spirits walk  earth  why do they come  me it  required  every man  ghost returned that  spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen  travel far  wide  if  spirit goes not forth  life   condemned  do so after death it  doomed  wander through  worldoh woe  meand witness what  cannot share but might have shared  earth  turned  happiness again  spectre raised  cry  shook  chain  wrung  shadowy hands you  fettered said scrooge trembling tell me why i wear  chain i forged  life replied  ghost i made  link  link  yard  yard i girded    my own free will   my own free  i wore it is  pattern strange  you scrooge trembled more  more or would you know pursued  ghost the weight  length   strong coil you bear yourself it  full  heavy   long  this seven christmas eves ago you have laboured  it since it   ponderous chain scrooge glanced about him   floor   expectation  finding himself surrounded  some fifty or sixty fathoms  iron cable but  could see nothing jacob  said imploringly old jacob marley tell me more speak comfort  me jacob i have none  give  ghost replied it comes  other regions ebenezer scrooge   conveyed  other ministers  other kinds  men nor can i tell you what i would a very little more  all permitted  me i cannot rest i cannot stay i cannot linger anywhere my spirit never walked beyond our countinghousemark mein life my spirit never roved beyond  narrow limits  our moneychanging hole  weary journeys lie before me it   habit  scrooge whenever  became thoughtful  put his hands  his breeches pockets pondering  what  ghost had said  did so now but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his knees you must have been very slow about it jacob scrooge observed   businesslike manner though  humility  deference slow  ghost repeated seven years dead mused scrooge and travelling all  time the whole time said  ghost no rest no peace incessant torture  remorse you travel fast said scrooge on  wings   wind replied  ghost you might have got over  great quantity  ground  seven years said scrooge the ghost  hearing this set up another cry  clanked  chain so hideously   dead silence   night   ward would have been justified  indicting    nuisance oh captive bound  doubleironed cried  phantom not  know  ages  incessant labour  immortal creatures  this earth must pass into eternity before  good  which   susceptible  all developed not  know  any christian spirit working kindly   little sphere whatever  may be  find  mortal life too short   vast means  usefulness not  know  no space  regret can make amends  one lifes opportunity misused yet such  i oh such  i but you  always  good man  business jacob faltered scrooge who now began  apply this  himself business cried  ghost wringing  hands again mankind  my business the common welfare  my business charity mercy forbearance  benevolence were all my business the dealings  my trade  but  drop  water   comprehensive ocean  my business it held up  chain  arms length  if    cause  all  unavailing grief  flung  heavily upon  ground again at this time   rolling year  spectre said i suffer most why did i walk through crowds  fellowbeings  my eyes turned down  never raise them   blessed star which led  wise men   poor abode were there no poor homes  which  light would have conducted me scrooge  very much dismayed  hear  spectre going   this rate  began  quake exceedingly hear me cried  ghost my time  nearly gone i will said scrooge but dont  hard upon me dont  flowery jacob pray how    i appear before you   shape  you can see i may not tell i have sat invisible beside you many  many  day it  not  agreeable idea scrooge shivered  wiped  perspiration  his brow that  no light part  my penance pursued  ghost i am here tonight  warn you  you have yet  chance  hope  escaping my fate a chance  hope  my procuring ebenezer you  always  good friend  me said scrooge thankee you   haunted resumed  ghost by three spirits scrooges countenance fell almost  low   ghosts had done is   chance  hope you mentioned jacob  demanded   faltering voice it is ii think id rather not said scrooge without their visits said  ghost you cannot hope  shun  path i tread expect  first tomorrow when  bell tolls one couldnt i take em all  once  have  over jacob hinted scrooge expect  second   next night   same hour the third upon  next night when  last stroke  twelve  ceased  vibrate look  see me no more  look that  your own sake you remember what  passed between us when  had said these words  spectre took  wrapper   table  bound  round  head  before scrooge knew this   smart sound  teeth made when  jaws  brought together   bandage he ventured  raise his eyes again  found his supernatural visitor confronting him   erect attitude   chain wound over  about  arm the apparition walked backward  him   every step  took  window raised itself  little so  when  spectre reached it   wide open it beckoned scrooge  approach which  did when they  within two paces  each other marleys ghost held up  hand warning him  come no nearer scrooge stopped not so much  obedience   surprise  fear    raising   hand  became sensible  confused noises   air incoherent sounds  lamentation  regret wailings inexpressibly sorrowful  selfaccusatory the spectre after listening   moment joined   mournful dirge  floated out upon  bleak dark night scrooge followed   window desperate  his curiosity he looked out the air  filled  phantoms wandering hither  thither  restless haste  moaning  they went every one  them wore chains like marleys ghost some few they might  guilty governments  linked together none  free many had been personally known  scrooge  their lives he had been quite familiar  one old ghost   white waistcoat   monstrous iron safe attached   ankle who cried piteously  being unable  assist  wretched woman   infant whom  saw below upon  doorstep the misery  them all was clearly  they sought  interfere  good  human matters  had lost  power  ever whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them  could not tell but they  their spirit voices faded together   night became   had been when  walked home scrooge closed  window  examined  door  which  ghost had entered it  doublelocked   had locked   his own hands   bolts  undisturbed he tried  say humbug but stopped   first syllable and being   emotion  had undergone or  fatigues   day or his glimpse   invisible world or  dull conversation   ghost or  lateness   hour much  need  repose went straight  bed without undressing  fell asleep upon  instant stave ii the first of the three spirits when scrooge awoke   so dark  looking out  bed  could scarcely distinguish  transparent window   opaque walls  his chamber he  endeavouring  pierce  darkness  his ferret eyes when  chimes   neighbouring church struck  four quarters so  listened   hour to his great astonishment  heavy bell went   six  seven   seven  eight  regularly up  twelve then stopped twelve it  past two when  went  bed the clock  wrong an icicle must have got into  works twelve he touched  spring  his repeater  correct this most preposterous clock its rapid little pulse beat twelve  stopped why  isnt possible said scrooge that i can have slept through  whole day  far into another night it isnt possible  anything  happened   sun  this  twelve  noon the idea being  alarming one  scrambled out  bed  groped his way   window he  obliged  rub  frost off   sleeve  his dressinggown before  could see anything  could see very little then all  could make out was    still very foggy  extremely cold   there  no noise  people running   fro  making  great stir  there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day  taken possession   world this   great relief because three days after sight  this first  exchange pay  mr ebenezer scrooge or his order  so forth would have become  mere united states security if there  no days  count by scrooge went  bed again  thought  thought  thought  over  over  over  could make nothing  it the more  thought  more perplexed  was   more  endeavoured not  think  more  thought marleys ghost bothered him exceedingly every time  resolved within himself after mature inquiry    all  dream his mind flew back again like  strong spring released   first position  presented  same problem   worked all through was   dream or not scrooge lay  this state until  chime had gone three quarters more when  remembered   sudden   ghost had warned him   visitation when  bell tolled one he resolved  lie awake until  hour  passed and considering   could no more go  sleep than go  heaven this  perhaps  wisest resolution  his power the quarter  so long    more than once convinced  must have sunk into  doze unconsciously  missed  clock at length  broke upon his listening ear ding dong a quarter past said scrooge counting ding dong halfpast said scrooge ding dong a quarter  it said scrooge ding dong the hour itself said scrooge triumphantly and nothing else he spoke before  hour bell sounded which  now did   deep dull hollow melancholy one light flashed up   room upon  instant   curtains  his bed  drawn the curtains  his bed  drawn aside i tell you   hand not  curtains  his feet nor  curtains  his back but those  which his face  addressed the curtains  his bed  drawn aside  scrooge starting up into  halfrecumbent attitude found himself face  face   unearthly visitor who drew them  close    i am now  you  i am standing   spirit  your elbow it   strange figurelike  child yet not so like  child  like  old man viewed through some supernatural medium which gave him  appearance  having receded   view  being diminished   childs proportions its hair which hung about  neck  down  back  white  if  age  yet  face had not

out  worldly hands  light i give is  not enough  you  one  those whose passions made this cap  force me through whole trains  years  wear  low upon my brow scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention  offend or any knowledge  having wilfully bonneted  spirit  any period  his life he then made bold  inquire what business brought him there your welfare said  ghost scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking   night  unbroken rest would have been more conducive   end the spirit must have heard him thinking   said immediately your reclamation then take heed it put out

they had some music for they   musical family  knew what they  about when they sung  glee or catch i can assure you especially topper who could growl away   bass like  good one  never swell  large veins  his forehead or get red   face over it scrooges niece played well upon  harp  played among other tunes  simple little air a mere nothing you might learn  whistle   two minutes which had been familiar   child who fetched scrooge   boardingschool   had been reminded   ghost  christmas past when this strain  music sounded all  things  ghost had shown him came upon his mind  softened more  more  thought  if  could have listened   often years ago  might have cultivated  kindnesses  life  his own happiness  his own hands without resorting   sextons spade  buried jacob marley but they didnt devote  whole evening  music after  while they played  forfeits    good   children sometimes  never better than  christmas when  mighty founder   child himself stop there  first  game  blindmans buff of course there was and i no more believe topper  really blind than i believe  had eyes  his boots my opinion is     done thing between him  scrooges nephew    ghost  christmas present knew it the way  went after  plump sister   lace tucker   outrage   credulity  human nature knocking down  fireirons tumbling over  chairs bumping against  piano smothering himself among  curtains wherever she went there went he he always knew where  plump sister was he wouldnt catch anybody else if you had fallen up against him as some  them did  purpose  would have made  feint  endeavouring  seize you which would have been  affront  your understanding  would instantly have sidled off   direction   plump sister she often cried out   wasnt fair   really  not but when  last  caught her when  spite  all her silken rustlings  her rapid flutterings past him  got her into  corner whence there  no escape then his conduct   most execrable for his pretending not  know her his pretending    necessary  touch her headdress  further  assure himself  her identity  pressing  certain ring upon her finger   certain chain about her neck  vile monstrous no doubt she told him her opinion  it when another blindman being  office they  so very confidential together behind  curtains scrooges niece  not one   blindmans buff party but  made comfortable   large chair   footstool   snug corner where  ghost

sisters hollow though they  sharp girls too  topper could have told you there might have been twenty people there young  old but they all played  so did scrooge  wholly forgetting   interest  had  what  going on  his voice made no sound  their ears  sometimes came out  his guess quite loud  very often guessed quite right too   sharpest needle best whitechapel warranted not  cut   eye  not sharper than scrooge blunt   took   his head  be the ghost  greatly pleased  find him  this mood  looked upon him  such favour   begged like  boy   allowed  stay until  guests departed but this  spirit said could not  done here   new game said scrooge one half hour spirit only one it   game called yes  no where scrooges nephew had  think  something   rest must find out what  only answering

their travels much they saw  far they went  many homes they visited but always   happy end the spirit stood beside sick beds  they  cheerful  foreign lands  they  close  home  struggling men  they  patient  their greater hope  poverty    rich in almshouse hospital  jail  miserys every refuge where vain man  his little brief authority had not made fast  door  barred  spirit out  left his blessing  taught scrooge his precepts it   long night if   only  night but scrooge had his doubts  this because  christmas holidays appeared   condensed into  space  time they passed together it  strange too  while scrooge remained unaltered  his outward form  ghost grew older clearly older scrooge had observed this change but never spoke  it until they left  childrens twelfth night party when looking   spirit  they stood together   open place  noticed   hair  grey are spirits lives so short asked scrooge my life upon this globe  very brief replied  ghost it ends tonight tonight cried scrooge tonight

children wretched abject frightful hideous miserable they knelt down   feet  clung upon  outside   garment oh man look here look look down here exclaimed  ghost they   boy  girl yellow meagre ragged scowling wolfish but prostrate too  their humility where graceful youth should have filled their features out  touched them   freshest tints  stale  shrivelled hand like   age had pinched  twisted them  pulled them into shreds where angels might have sat enthroned devils lurked  glared out menacing no change no degradation no perversion  humanity  any grade through all  mysteries  wonderful creation  monsters half so horrible  dread scrooge started back appalled having them shown  him  this way  tried  say they  fine children but  words choked themselves rather than  parties   lie  such enormous magnitude spirit  they yours scrooge could say no more they  mans said  spirit looking down upon them and they cling  me appealing  their fathers this boy  ignorance this girl  want beware them both  all  their degree but most  all beware this boy   his brow i see  written which  doom unless  writing  erased deny it cried  spirit stretching out  hand towards  city slander those who tell  ye admit   your factious purposes  make  worse and bide  end have they no refuge or resource cried scrooge are there no prisons said  spirit turning  him   last time  his own words are there no workhouses the bell struck twelve scrooge looked about him   ghost  saw  not as  last stroke ceased  vibrate  remembered  prediction  old jacob marley  lifting up his eyes beheld  solemn phantom draped  hooded coming like  mist along  ground towards him stave iv the last of the spirits the phantom slowly gravely silently approached when  came near him scrooge bent down upon his knee    very

used  ghostly company  this time scrooge feared  silent shape so much  his legs trembled beneath him   found   could hardly stand when  prepared  follow it the spirit paused  moment  observing his condition  giving him time  recover but scrooge  all  worse  this it thrilled him   vague uncertain horror  know  behind  dusky shroud there  ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him while he though  stretched his own   utmost could see nothing but  spectral hand  one great heap  black ghost   future  exclaimed i fear you more than any spectre i have seen but  i know your purpose   do me good   i
