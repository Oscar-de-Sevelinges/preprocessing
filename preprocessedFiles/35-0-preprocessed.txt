story epilogue i introduction the time traveller for so    convenient  speak  him  expounding  recondite matter  us his pale grey eyes shone  twinkled  his usually pale face  flushed  animated the fire burnt brightly   soft radiance   incandescent lights   lilies  silver caught  bubbles  flashed  passed  our glasses our chairs being his patents embraced  caressed us rather than submitted   sat upon  there   luxurious afterdinner atmosphere when thought runs gracefully free   trammels  precision and  put   us  this way—marking  points   lean forefinger—as we sat  lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox as we thought it  his fecundity “you must follow me carefully i shall have  controvert one or two ideas   almost universally accepted the geometry  instance they taught you  school  founded   misconception” “is not  rather  large thing  expect us  begin upon” said filby  argumentative person  red hair “i do not mean  ask you  accept anything without reasonable ground  it you  soon admit  much  i need  you you know  course   mathematical line  line  thickness nil  no real existence they taught you that neither   mathematical plane these things  mere abstractions” “that  all right” said  psychologist “nor having only length breadth  thickness can  cube have  real existence” “there i object” said filby “of course  solid body may exist all real things—” “so most people think but wait  moment can  instantaneous cube exist” “don’t follow you” said filby “can  cube  does not last  any time  all have  real existence” filby became pensive “clearly”  time traveller proceeded “any real body must have extension  four directions  must have length breadth thickness and—duration but through  natural infirmity   flesh which i  explain  you   moment we incline  overlook this fact there  really four dimensions three which we call  three planes  space   fourth time there is however  tendency  draw  unreal distinction between  former three dimensions   latter because  happens  our consciousness moves intermittently  one direction along  latter   beginning   end  our lives” “that” said  very young man making spasmodic efforts  relight his cigar over  lamp “that    very clear indeed” “now   very remarkable  this  so extensively overlooked” continued  time traveller   slight accession  cheerfulness “really this  what  meant   fourth dimension though some people who talk about  fourth dimension do not know they mean it it  only another way  looking  time there  no difference between time  any   three dimensions  space except  our consciousness moves along it but some foolish people have got hold   wrong side   idea you have all heard what they have  say about this fourth dimension” “i have not” said  provincial mayor “it  simply this that space  our mathematicians have it  spoken   having three dimensions which one may call length breadth  thickness   always definable  reference  three planes each  right angles   others but some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly—why not another direction  right angles   other three—and have even tried  construct  fourdimensional geometry professor simon newcomb  expounding this   new york mathematical society only  month or so ago you know how   flat surface which  only two dimensions we can represent  figure   threedimensional solid  similarly they think   models  three dimensions they could represent one  four—if they could master  perspective   thing see” “i think so” murmured  provincial mayor and knitting his brows  lapsed into  introspective state his lips moving  one who repeats mystic words “yes i think i see  now”  said after some time brightening   quite transitory manner “well i do not mind telling you i have been  work upon this geometry  four dimensions  some time some  my results  curious for instance here   portrait   man  eight years old another  fifteen another  seventeen another  twentythree  so on all these  evidently sections   were threedimensional representations  his fourdimensioned being which   fixed  unalterable thing “scientific people” proceeded  time traveller after  pause required   proper assimilation  this “know very well  time  only  kind  space here   popular scientific diagram  weather record this line i trace  my finger shows  movement   barometer yesterday   so high yesterday night  fell then this morning  rose again  so gently upward  here surely  mercury did not trace this line  any   dimensions  space generally recognised but certainly  traced such  line   line therefore we must conclude  along  timedimension” “but” said  medical man staring hard   coal   fire “if time  really only  fourth dimension  space why  it  why   always been regarded  something different and why cannot we move  time  we move about   other dimensions  space” the time traveller smiled “are you so sure we can move freely  space right  left we can go backward  forward freely enough  men always have done so i admit we move freely  two dimensions but how about up  down gravitation limits us there” “not exactly” said  medical man “there  balloons” “but before  balloons save  spasmodic jumping   inequalities   surface man had no freedom  vertical movement” “still they could move  little up  down” said  medical man “easier far easier down than up” “and you cannot move  all  time you cannot get away   present moment” “my dear sir   just where you  wrong that  just where  whole world  gone wrong we  always getting away   present moment our mental existences which  immaterial  have no dimensions  passing along  timedimension   uniform velocity   cradle   grave just  we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above  earth’s surface” “but  great difficulty  this” interrupted  psychologist ’you can move about  all directions  space but you cannot move about  time” “that   germ  my great discovery but you  wrong  say  we cannot move about  time for instance if i am recalling  incident very vividly i go back   instant   occurrence i become absentminded  you say i jump back   moment of course we have no means  staying back  any length  time any more than  savage or  animal   staying six feet above  ground but  civilised man  better off than  savage  this respect he can go up against gravitation   balloon  why should  not hope  ultimately  may  able  stop or accelerate his drift along  timedimension or even turn about  travel  other way” “oh this” began filby “is all—” “why not” said  time traveller “it’s against reason” said filby “what reason” said  time traveller “you can show black  white  argument” said filby “but you  never convince me” “possibly not” said  time traveller “but now you begin  see  object  my investigations into  geometry  four dimensions long ago i had  vague inkling   machine—” “to travel through time” exclaimed  very young man “that shall travel indifferently  any direction  space  time   driver determines” filby contented himself  laughter “but i have experimental verification” said  time traveller “it would  remarkably convenient   historian”  psychologist suggested “one might travel back  verify  accepted account   battle  hastings  instance” “don’t you think you would attract attention” said  medical man “our ancestors had no great tolerance  anachronisms” “one might get one’s greek   very lips  homer  plato”  very young man thought “in which case they would certainly plough you   littlego the german scholars have improved greek so much” “then there   future” said  very young man “just think one might invest all one’s money leave   accumulate  interest  hurry  ahead” “to discover  society” said i “erected   strictly communistic basis” “of all  wild extravagant theories” began  psychologist “yes so  seemed  me  so i never talked   until—” “experimental verification” cried i “you  going  verify that” “the experiment” cried filby who  getting brainweary “let’s see your experiment anyhow” said  psychologist “though it’s all humbug you know” the time traveller smiled round  us then still smiling faintly   his hands deep  his trousers pockets  walked slowly out   room  we heard his slippers shuffling down  long passage  his laboratory the psychologist looked  us “i wonder what he’s got” “some sleightofhand trick or other” said  medical man  filby tried  tell us about  conjuror  had seen  burslem but before  had finished his preface  time traveller came back  filby’s anecdote collapsed ii the machine the thing  time traveller held  his hand   glittering metallic framework scarcely larger than  small clock  very delicately made there  ivory  it  some transparent crystalline substance and now i must  explicit  this  follows—unless his explanation    accepted—is  absolutely unaccountable thing he took one   small octagonal tables   scattered about  room  set   front   fire  two legs   hearthrug on this table  placed  mechanism then  drew up  chair  sat down the only other object   table   small shaded lamp  bright light  which fell upon  model there  also perhaps  dozen candles about two  brass candlesticks upon  mantel  several  sconces so   room  brilliantly illuminated i sat   low armchair nearest  fire  i drew this forward so    almost between  time traveller   fireplace filby sat behind him looking over his shoulder the medical man   provincial mayor watched him  profile   right  psychologist   left the very young man stood behind  psychologist we  all   alert it appears incredible  me  any kind  trick however subtly conceived  however adroitly done could have been played upon us under these conditions the time traveller looked  us  then   mechanism “well” said  psychologist “this little affair” said  time traveller resting his elbows upon  table  pressing his hands together above  apparatus “is only  model it  my plan   machine  travel through time you  notice   looks singularly askew   there   odd twinkling appearance about this bar  though    some way unreal” he pointed   part  his finger “also here  one little white lever  here  another” the medical man got up out  his chair  peered into  thing “it’s beautifully made”  said “it took two years  make” retorted  time traveller then when we had all imitated  action   medical man  said “now i want you clearly  understand  this lever being pressed over sends  machine gliding into  future  this other reverses  motion this saddle represents  seat   time traveller presently i am going  press  lever  off  machine  go it  vanish pass into future time  disappear have  good look   thing look   table too  satisfy yourselves there  no trickery i don’t want  waste this model  then  told i’m  quack” there   minute’s pause perhaps the psychologist seemed about  speak  me but changed his mind then  time traveller put forth his finger towards  lever “no”  said suddenly “lend me your hand” and turning   psychologist  took  individual’s hand  his own  told him  put out his forefinger so     psychologist himself who sent forth  model time machine   interminable voyage we all saw  lever turn i am absolutely certain there  no trickery there   breath  wind   lamp flame jumped one   candles   mantel  blown out   little machine suddenly swung round became indistinct  seen   ghost   second perhaps   eddy  faintly glittering brass  ivory    gone—vanished save   lamp  table  bare everyone  silent   minute then filby said   damned the psychologist recovered  his stupor  suddenly looked under  table at   time traveller laughed cheerfully “well”  said   reminiscence   psychologist then getting up  went   tobacco jar   mantel   his back  us began  fill his pipe we stared  each other “look here” said  medical man “are you  earnest about this do you seriously believe   machine  travelled into time” “certainly” said  time traveller stooping  light  spill   fire then  turned lighting his pipe  look   psychologist’s face the psychologist  show    not unhinged helped himself   cigar  tried  light  uncut “what  more i have  big machine nearly finished  there”—he indicated  laboratory—“and when   put together i mean  have  journey  my own account” “you mean  say   machine  travelled into  future” said filby “into  future or  past—i don’t  certain know which” after  interval  psychologist had  inspiration “it must have gone into  past if   gone anywhere”  said “why” said  time traveller “because i presume    not moved  space  if  travelled into  future  would still  here all this time since  must have travelled through this time” “but” said i “if  travelled into  past  would have been visible when we came first into this room  last thursday when we  here   thursday before that  so forth” “serious objections” remarked  provincial mayor   air  impartiality turning towards  time traveller “not  bit” said  time traveller and   psychologist “you think you can explain that it’s presentation below  threshold you know diluted presentation” “of course” said  psychologist  reassured us “that’s  simple point  psychology i should have thought  it it’s plain enough  helps  paradox delightfully we cannot see it nor can we appreciate this machine any more than we can  spoke   wheel spinning or  bullet flying through  air if   travelling through time fifty times or  hundred times faster than we are if  gets through  minute while we get through  second  impression  creates   course  only onefiftieth or onehundredth  what  would make if   not travelling  time that’s plain enough” he passed his hand through  space  which  machine had been “you see”  said laughing we sat  stared   vacant table   minute or so then  time traveller asked us what we thought   all “it sounds plausible enough tonight” said  medical man “but wait until tomorrow wait   common sense   morning” “would you like  see  time machine itself” asked  time traveller and therewith taking  lamp  his hand  led  way down  long draughty corridor  his laboratory i remember vividly  flickering light his queer broad head  silhouette  dance   shadows how we all followed him puzzled but incredulous  how there   laboratory we beheld  larger edition   little mechanism which we had seen vanish  before our eyes parts   nickel parts  ivory parts had certainly been filed or sawn out  rock crystal the thing  generally complete but  twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon  bench beside some sheets  drawings  i took one up   better look  it quartz  seemed  be “look here” said  medical man “are you perfectly serious or  this  trick—like  ghost you showed us last christmas” “upon  machine” said  time traveller holding  lamp aloft “i intend  explore time is  plain i  never more serious  my life” none  us quite knew how  take it i caught filby’s eye over  shoulder   medical man   winked  me solemnly iii the time traveller returns i think    time none  us quite believed   time machine the fact is  time traveller  one  those men who  too clever   believed you never felt  you saw all round him you always suspected some subtle reserve some ingenuity  ambush behind his lucid frankness had filby shown  model  explained  matter   time traveller’s words we should have shown him far less scepticism for we should have perceived his motives  porkbutcher could understand filby but  time traveller had more than  touch  whim among his elements  we distrusted him things  would have made  fame   less clever man seemed tricks  his hands it   mistake  do things too easily the serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure  his deportment they  somehow aware  trusting their reputations  judgment  him  like furnishing  nursery  eggshell china so i don’t think any  us said very much about time travelling   interval between  thursday   next though  odd potentialities ran no doubt  most  our minds  plausibility  is  practical incredibleness  curious possibilities  anachronism   utter confusion  suggested for my own part i  particularly preoccupied   trick   model that i remember discussing   medical man whom i met  friday   linnæan he said  had seen  similar thing  tübingen  laid considerable stress   blowingout   candle but how  trick  done  could not explain the next thursday i went again  richmond—i suppose i  one   time traveller’s most constant guests—and arriving late found four or five men already assembled  his drawingroom the medical man  standing before  fire   sheet  paper  one hand  his watch   other i looked round   time traveller and—“it’s halfpast seven now” said  medical man “i suppose we’d better have dinner” “where’s——” said i naming our host “you’ve just come it’s rather odd he’s unavoidably detained he asks me  this note  lead off  dinner  seven if he’s not back says he’ll explain when  comes” “it seems  pity  let  dinner spoil” said  editor   wellknown daily paper  thereupon  doctor rang  bell the psychologist   only person besides  doctor  myself who had attended  previous dinner the other men  blank  editor aforementioned  certain journalist  another—a quiet shy man   beard—whom i didn’t know  who  far  my observation went never opened his mouth all  evening there  some speculation   dinnertable about  time traveller’s absence  i suggested time travelling   halfjocular spirit the editor wanted  explained  him   psychologist volunteered  wooden account   “ingenious paradox  trick” we had witnessed  day week he    midst  his exposition when  door   corridor opened slowly  without noise i  facing  door  saw  first “hallo” i said “at last” and  door opened wider   time traveller stood before us i gave  cry  surprise “good heavens man what’s  matter” cried  medical man who saw him next and  whole tableful turned towards  door he    amazing plight his coat  dusty  dirty  smeared  green down  sleeves his hair disordered    seemed  me greyer—either  dust  dirt or because  colour had actually faded his face  ghastly pale his chin had  brown cut  it—a cut halfhealed his expression  haggard  drawn   intense suffering for  moment  hesitated   doorway  if  had been dazzled   light then  came into  room he walked  just such  limp  i have seen  footsore tramps we stared  him  silence expecting him  speak he said not  word but came painfully   table  made  motion towards  wine the editor filled  glass  champagne  pushed  towards him he drained it   seemed  do him good   looked round  table   ghost  his old smile flickered across his face “what  earth have you been up to man” said  doctor the time traveller did not seem  hear “don’t let me disturb you”  said   certain faltering articulation “i’m all right” he stopped held out his glass  more  took  off   draught “that’s good”  said his eyes grew brighter   faint colour came into his cheeks his glance flickered over our faces   certain dull approval  then went round  warm  comfortable room then  spoke again still    feeling his way among his words “i’m going  wash  dress  then i’ll come down  explain things save me some   mutton i’m starving   bit  meat” he looked across   editor who   rare visitor  hoped   all right the editor began  question “tell you presently” said  time traveller “i’m—funny be all right   minute” he put down his glass  walked towards  staircase door again i remarked his lameness   soft padding sound  his footfall  standing up  my place i saw his feet   went out he had nothing  them but  pair  tattered bloodstained socks then  door closed upon him i had half  mind  follow till i remembered how  detested any fuss about himself for  minute perhaps my mind  woolgathering then “remarkable behaviour   eminent scientist” i heard  editor say thinking after his wont  headlines and this brought my attention back   bright dinnertable “what’s  game” said  journalist “has  been doing  amateur cadger i don’t follow” i met  eye   psychologist  read my own interpretation  his face i thought   time traveller limping painfully upstairs i don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness the first  recover completely  this surprise   medical man who rang  bell—the time traveller hated  have servants waiting  dinner—for  hot plate at   editor turned  his knife  fork   grunt   silent man followed suit the dinner  resumed conversation  exclamatory   little while  gaps  wonderment  then  editor got fervent  his curiosity “does our friend eke out his modest income   crossing or   his nebuchadnezzar phases”  inquired “i feel assured it’s this business   time machine” i said  took up  psychologist’s account  our previous meeting the new guests  frankly incredulous the editor raised objections “what was this time travelling a man couldn’t cover himself  dust  rolling   paradox could he” and then   idea came home  him  resorted  caricature hadn’t they any clothesbrushes   future the journalist too would not believe  any price  joined  editor   easy work  heaping ridicule   whole thing they  both  new kind  journalist—very joyous irreverent young men “our special correspondent   day after tomorrow reports”  journalist  saying—or rather shouting—when  time traveller came back he  dressed  ordinary evening clothes  nothing save his haggard look remained   change  had startled me “i say” said  editor hilariously “these chaps here say you have been travelling into  middle  next week tell us all about little rosebery  you what  you take   lot” the time traveller came   place reserved  him without  word he smiled quietly  his old way “where’s my mutton”  said “what  treat    stick  fork into meat again” “story” cried  editor “story  damned” said  time traveller “i want something  eat i won’t say  word until i get some peptone into my arteries thanks and  salt” “one word” said i “have you been time travelling” “yes” said  time traveller  his mouth full nodding his head “i’d give  shilling  line   verbatim note” said  editor the time traveller pushed his glass towards  silent man  rang   his fingernail  which  silent man who had been staring  his face started convulsively  poured him wine the rest   dinner  uncomfortable for my own part sudden questions kept  rising  my lips  i dare say    same   others the journalist tried  relieve  tension  telling anecdotes  hettie potter the time traveller devoted his attention  his dinner  displayed  appetite   tramp the medical man smoked  cigarette  watched  time traveller through his eyelashes the silent man seemed even more clumsy than usual  drank champagne  regularity  determination out  sheer nervousness at last  time traveller pushed his plate away  looked round us “i suppose i must apologise”  said “i  simply starving i’ve had  most amazing time” he reached out his hand   cigar  cut  end “but come into  smokingroom it’s too long  story  tell over greasy plates” and ringing  bell  passing  led  way into  adjoining room “you have told blank  dash  chose about  machine”  said  me leaning back  his easychair  naming  three new guests “but  thing’s  mere paradox” said  editor “i can’t argue tonight i don’t mind telling you  story but i can’t argue i will”  went on “tell you  story  what  happened  me if you like but you must refrain  interruptions i want  tell it badly most    sound like lying so  it it’s true—every word  it all  same i   my laboratory  four o’clock  since then … i’ve lived eight days … such days  no human being ever lived before i’m nearly worn out but i shan’t sleep till i’ve told this thing over  you then i shall go  bed but no interruptions is  agreed” “agreed” said  editor   rest  us echoed “agreed” and    time traveller began his story  i have set  forth he sat back  his chair  first  spoke like  weary man afterwards  got more animated in writing  down i feel  only too much keenness  inadequacy  pen  ink—and above all my own inadequacy—to express  quality you read i  suppose attentively enough but you cannot see  speaker’s white sincere face   bright circle   little lamp nor hear  intonation  his voice you cannot know how his expression followed  turns  his story most  us hearers   shadow   candles   smokingroom had not been lighted  only  face   journalist   legs   silent man   knees downward  illuminated at first we glanced now  again  each other after  time we ceased  do that  looked only   time traveller’s face iv time travelling “i told some  you last thursday   principles   time machine  showed you  actual thing itself incomplete   workshop there   now  little travelworn truly  one   ivory bars  cracked   brass rail bent but  rest  it’s sound enough i expected  finish   friday but  friday when  putting together  nearly done i found  one   nickel bars  exactly one inch too short  this i had  get remade so   thing  not complete until this morning it   ten o’clock today   first  all time machines began  career i gave   last tap tried all  screws again put one more drop  oil   quartz rod  sat myself   saddle i suppose  suicide who holds  pistol  his skull feels much  same wonder  what  come next  i felt then i took  starting lever  one hand   stopping one   other pressed  first  almost immediately  second i seemed  reel i felt  nightmare sensation  falling and looking round i saw  laboratory exactly  before had anything happened for  moment i suspected  my intellect had tricked me then i noted  clock a moment before   seemed  had stood   minute or so past ten now   nearly halfpast three “i drew  breath set my teeth gripped  starting lever  both hands  went off   thud the laboratory got hazy  went dark mrs watchett came   walked apparently without seeing me towards  garden door i suppose  took her  minute or so  traverse  place but  me she seemed  shoot across  room like  rocket i pressed  lever over   extreme position the night came like  turning out   lamp   another moment came tomorrow the laboratory grew faint  hazy then fainter  ever fainter tomorrow night came black then day again night again day again faster  faster still an eddying murmur filled my ears   strange dumb confusedness descended  my mind “i am afraid i cannot convey  peculiar sensations  time travelling they  excessively unpleasant there   feeling exactly like  one  upon  switchback—of  helpless headlong motion i felt  same horrible anticipation too   imminent smash as i put  pace night followed day like  flapping   black wing the dim suggestion   laboratory seemed presently  fall away  me  i saw  sun hopping swiftly across  sky leaping  every minute  every minute marking  day i supposed  laboratory had been destroyed  i had come into  open air i had  dim impression  scaffolding but i  already going too fast   conscious  any moving things the slowest snail  ever crawled dashed  too fast  me the twinkling succession  darkness  light  excessively painful   eye then   intermittent darknesses i saw  moon spinning swiftly through her quarters  new  full  had  faint glimpse   circling stars presently  i went on still gaining velocity  palpitation  night  day merged into one continuous greyness  sky took   wonderful deepness  blue  splendid luminous colour like   early twilight  jerking sun became  streak  fire  brilliant arch  space  moon  fainter fluctuating band  i could see nothing   stars save now  then  brighter circle flickering   blue “the landscape  misty  vague i  still   hillside upon which this house now stands   shoulder rose above me grey  dim i saw trees growing  changing like puffs  vapour now brown now green they grew spread shivered  passed away i saw huge buildings rise up faint  fair  pass like dreams the whole surface   earth seemed changed—melting  flowing under my eyes the little hands upon  dials  registered my speed raced round faster  faster presently i noted   sun belt swayed up  down  solstice  solstice   minute or less   consequently my pace  over  year  minute  minute  minute  white snow flashed across  world  vanished   followed   bright brief green  spring “the unpleasant sensations   start  less poignant now they merged  last into  kind  hysterical exhilaration i remarked indeed  clumsy swaying   machine  which i  unable  account but my mind  too confused  attend  it so   kind  madness growing upon me i flung myself into futurity at first i scarce thought  stopping scarce thought  anything but these new sensations but presently  fresh series  impressions grew up  my mind—a certain curiosity  therewith  certain dread—until  last they took complete possession  me what strange developments  humanity what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation i thought might not appear when i came  look nearly into  dim elusive world  raced  fluctuated before my eyes i saw great  splendid architecture rising about me more massive than any buildings  our own time  yet   seemed built  glimmer  mist i saw  richer green flow up  hillside  remain there without any wintry intermission even through  veil  my confusion  earth seemed very fair and so my mind came round   business  stopping “the peculiar risk lay   possibility  my finding some substance   space which i or  machine occupied so long  i travelled   high velocity through time this scarcely mattered i was so  speak attenuated—was slipping like  vapour through  interstices  intervening substances but  come   stop involved  jamming  myself molecule  molecule into whatever lay  my way meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact  those   obstacle   profound chemical reaction—possibly  farreaching explosion—would result  blow myself  my apparatus out  all possible dimensions—into  unknown this possibility had occurred  me again  again while i  making  machine but then i had cheerfully accepted    unavoidable risk—one   risks  man  got  take now  risk  inevitable i no longer saw    same cheerful light the fact  that insensibly  absolute strangeness  everything  sickly jarring  swaying   machine above all  feeling  prolonged falling had absolutely upset my nerves i told myself  i could never stop    gust  petulance i resolved  stop forthwith like  impatient fool i lugged over  lever  incontinently  thing went reeling over  i  flung headlong through  air “there   sound   clap  thunder  my ears i may have been stunned   moment a pitiless hail  hissing round me  i  sitting  soft turf  front   overset machine everything still seemed grey but presently i remarked   confusion  my ears  gone i looked round me i   what seemed    little lawn   garden surrounded  rhododendron bushes  i noticed  their mauve  purple blossoms  dropping   shower under  beating   hailstones the rebounding dancing hail hung   little cloud over  machine  drove along  ground like smoke in  moment i  wet   skin ‘fine hospitality’ said i ‘to  man who  travelled innumerable years  see you’ “presently i thought what  fool i   get wet i stood up  looked round me a colossal figure carved apparently  some white stone loomed indistinctly beyond  rhododendrons through  hazy downpour but all else   world  invisible “my sensations would  hard  describe as  columns  hail grew thinner i saw  white figure more distinctly it  very large   silver birchtree touched  shoulder it   white marble  shape something like  winged sphinx but  wings instead  being carried vertically   sides  spread so   seemed  hover the pedestal  appeared  me   bronze   thick  verdigris it chanced   face  towards me  sightless eyes seemed  watch me there   faint shadow   smile   lips it  greatly weatherworn   imparted  unpleasant suggestion  disease i stood looking     little space—half  minute perhaps or half  hour it seemed  advance   recede   hail drove before  denser or thinner at last i tore my eyes     moment  saw   hail curtain had worn threadbare    sky  lightening   promise   sun “i looked up again   crouching white shape   full temerity  my voyage came suddenly upon me what might appear when  hazy curtain  altogether withdrawn what might not have happened  men what if cruelty had grown into  common passion what if  this interval  race had lost  manliness  had developed into something inhuman unsympathetic  overwhelmingly powerful i might seem some oldworld savage animal only  more dreadful  disgusting  our common likeness—a foul creature   incontinently slain “already i saw other vast shapes—huge buildings  intricate parapets  tall columns   wooded hillside dimly creeping  upon me through  lessening storm i  seized   panic fear i turned frantically   time machine  strove hard  readjust it as i did so  shafts   sun smote through  thunderstorm the grey downpour  swept aside  vanished like  trailing garments   ghost above me   intense blue   summer sky some faint brown shreds  cloud whirled into nothingness the great buildings about me stood out clear  distinct shining

high up   wall   nearer house i saw  group  figures clad  rich soft robes they had seen me  their faces  directed towards me “then i heard voices approaching me coming through  bushes   white sphinx   heads  shoulders  men running one  these emerged   pathway leading straight   little lawn upon which i stood  my machine he   slight creature—perhaps four feet high—clad   purple tunic girdled   waist   leather belt sandals or buskins—i could not clearly distinguish which—were  his feet his legs  bare   knees  his head  bare noticing that i noticed   first time how warm  air was “he struck me  being  very beautiful  graceful creature but indescribably frail his flushed face reminded me   more beautiful kind  consumptive—that hectic beauty  which we used  hear so much at  sight  him i suddenly regained confidence i took my hands   machine v in  golden age “in another moment we  standing face  face i  this fragile thing out  futurity he came straight up  me  laughed into my eyes the absence  his bearing  any sign  fear struck me  once then  turned   two others who  following him  spoke  them   strange  very sweet  liquid tongue “there  others coming  presently  little group  perhaps eight or ten  these exquisite creatures  about me one  them addressed me it came into my head oddly enough  my voice  too harsh  deep  them so i shook my head and pointing  my ears shook  again he came  step forward hesitated  then touched my hand then i felt other soft little tentacles upon my back  shoulders they wanted  make sure i  real there  nothing  this  all alarming indeed there  something  these pretty little people  inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness  certain childlike ease and besides they looked so frail  i could fancy myself flinging  whole dozen  them about like ninepins but i made  sudden motion  warn them when i saw their little pink hands feeling   time machine happily then when   not too late i thought   danger i had hitherto forgotten  reaching over  bars   machine i unscrewed  little levers  would set   motion  put these  my pocket then i turned again  see what i could do   way  communication “and then looking more nearly into their features i saw some further peculiarities  their dresden china type  prettiness their hair which  uniformly curly came   sharp end   neck  cheek there  not  faintest suggestion     face  their ears  singularly minute the mouths  small  bright red rather thin lips   little chins ran   point the eyes  large  mild and—this may seem egotism  my part—i fancied even  there   certain lack   interest i might have expected  them “as they made no effort  communicate  me but simply stood round me smiling  speaking  soft cooing notes  each other i began  conversation i pointed   time machine   myself then hesitating   moment how  express time i pointed   sun at once  quaintly pretty little figure  chequered purple  white followed my gesture  then astonished me  imitating  sound  thunder “for  moment i  staggered though  import  his gesture  plain enough the question had come into my mind abruptly  these creatures fools you may hardly understand how  took me you see i had always anticipated   people

laughing towards me carrying  chain  beautiful flowers altogether new  me  put  about my neck the idea  received  melodious applause  presently they  all running   fro  flowers  laughingly flinging them upon me until i  almost smothered  blossom you who have never seen  like can scarcely imagine what delicate  wonderful flowers countless years  culture had created then someone suggested  their

them  memory  my confident anticipations   profoundly grave  intellectual posterity came  irresistible merriment  my mind “the building had  huge entry   altogether  colossal dimensions i  naturally most occupied   growing crowd  little people    big open portals  yawned before me shadowy  mysterious my general impression   world i saw over their heads   tangled waste  beautiful bushes  flowers  long neglected  yet weedless garden i saw  number  tall spikes  strange white flowers measuring  foot perhaps across  spread   waxen petals they grew scattered  if wild among  variegated shrubs but  i say i did not examine them closely  this time the time machine  left deserted   turf among  rhododendrons “the arch   doorway  richly carved but naturally i did not observe  carving very narrowly though i fancied i saw suggestions  old phœnician decorations  i passed through   struck me  they  very badly broken  weatherworn several more brightly clad people met me   doorway  so we entered i dressed  dingy nineteenthcentury garments looking grotesque enough garlanded  flowers  surrounded   eddying mass  bright softcoloured robes  shining white limbs   melodious whirl  laughter  laughing speech “the big doorway opened into  proportionately great hall hung  brown the roof   shadow   windows partially glazed  coloured glass  partially unglazed admitted  tempered light the floor  made up  huge blocks  some very hard white metal not plates nor slabs—blocks    so much worn  i judged   going   fro  past generations    deeply channelled along  more frequented ways transverse   length  innumerable tables made  slabs  polished stone raised perhaps  foot   floor  upon these  heaps  fruits some i recognised   kind  hypertrophied raspberry  orange but   most part they  strange “between  tables  scattered  great number  cushions upon these my conductors seated themselves signing  me  do likewise with  pretty absence  ceremony they began  eat  fruit  their hands flinging peel  stalks  so forth into  round openings   sides   tables i  not loath  follow their example  i felt thirsty  hungry as i did so i surveyed  hall  my leisure “and perhaps  thing  struck me most   dilapidated

fractured nevertheless  general effect  extremely rich  picturesque there were perhaps  couple  hundred people dining   hall  most  them seated  near  me  they could come  watching me  interest their little eyes shining over  fruit they  eating all  clad   same soft  yet strong silky material “fruit   bye  all their diet these people   remote future  strict vegetarians  while i   them  spite  some carnal cravings i had   frugivorous also indeed i found afterwards  horses cattle sheep dogs had followed  ichthyosaurus into extinction but  fruits  very delightful one  particular  seemed    season all  time i  there—a floury thing   threesided husk—was especially good  i made  my staple at first i  puzzled  all these strange fruits    strange flowers i saw but later i began  perceive their import “however i am telling you  my fruit dinner   distant future now so soon  my appetite   little checked i determined  make  resolute attempt  learn  speech  these new men  mine clearly    next

efforts met   stare  surprise or inextinguishable laughter but presently  fairhaired little creature seemed  grasp my intention  repeated  name they had  chatter  explain  business  great length  each other  my first attempts  make  exquisite little sounds  their language caused  immense amount  genuine if uncivil amusement however i felt like  schoolmaster amidst children  persisted  presently i had  score  noun substantives  least  my command  then i got  demonstrative pronouns  even  verb ‘to eat’ but   slow work   little people soon tired  wanted  get away  my interrogations so i determined rather  necessity  let them give their lessons  little doses when they felt inclined and very little doses i found they  before long  i never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued vi the sunset  mankind “a queer thing i soon discovered about my little hosts    their lack  interest they would come  me  eager cries  astonishment like children but like children they would soon stop examining me  wander away after some other toy the dinner  my conversational beginnings ended i noted   first time  almost all those who had surrounded me  first  gone it  odd too how speedily i came  disregard these little people i went out through  portal into  sunlit world again  soon  my hunger  satisfied i  continually meeting more  these men   future who would follow me  little distance chatter  laugh about me and having smiled  gesticulated   friendly way leave me again  my own devices “the calm  evening  upon  world  i emerged   great hall   scene  lit   warm glow   setting sun at first things  very confusing everything  so entirely different   world i had known—even  flowers the big building i had left  situated   slope   broad river valley but  thames had shifted perhaps  mile   present position i resolved  mount   summit   crest perhaps  mile   half away  which i could get  wider view  this our planet   year eight hundred  two thousand seven hundred

beautiful pagodalike plants—nettles possibly—but wonderfully tinted  brown about  leaves  incapable  stinging it  evidently  derelict remains  some vast structure  what end built i could not determine it  here  i  destined   later date  have  very strange experience—the first intimation   still stranger discovery—but   i  speak   proper place “looking round   sudden thought   terrace  which i rested   while i realised  there  no small houses   seen apparently  single house  possibly even  household had vanished here  there among  greenery  palacelike buildings but  house   cottage which form such characteristic features  our own english landscape had disappeared “‘communism’ said i  myself “and   heels   came another thought i looked   halfdozen little figures   following me then   flash i perceived  all had  same form  costume  same soft hairless visage   same girlish rotundity  limb it may seem strange perhaps  i had not noticed this before but everything  so strange now i saw  fact plainly enough in costume   all  differences  texture  bearing  now mark off  sexes  each other these people   future  alike and  children seemed  my eyes   but  miniatures  their parents i judged then   children   time  extremely precocious physically  least  i found afterwards abundant verification  my opinion “seeing  ease  security  which these people  living i felt  this close resemblance   sexes  after all what one would expect   strength   man   softness   woman  institution   family   differentiation  occupations  mere militant necessities   age  physical force where population  balanced  abundant much childbearing becomes  evil rather than  blessing   state where violence comes but rarely  offspring  secure there  less necessity—indeed there  no necessity—for  efficient family   specialisation   sexes  reference  their children’s needs disappears we see some beginnings  this even  our own time   this future age   complete this i must remind you  my speculation   time later i   appreciate how far  fell short   reality “while i  musing upon these things my attention  attracted   pretty little structure like  well under  cupola i thought   transitory way   oddness  wells still existing  then resumed  thread  my speculations there  no large buildings towards  top   hill   my walking powers  evidently miraculous i  presently left alone   first time with  strange sense  freedom  adventure i pushed  up   crest “there i found  seat  some yellow metal  i did not recognise corroded  places   kind  pinkish rust  half smothered  soft moss  armrests cast  filed into  resemblance  griffins’ heads i sat down  it  i surveyed  broad view  our old world under  sunset   long day it   sweet  fair  view  i have ever seen the sun had already gone below  horizon   west  flaming gold touched  some horizontal bars  purple  crimson below   valley   thames  which  river lay like  band  burnished steel i have already spoken   great palaces dotted about among  variegated greenery some  ruins  some still occupied here  there rose  white or silvery figure   waste garden   earth here  there came  sharp vertical line  some cupola or obelisk there  no hedges no signs  proprietary rights no evidences  agriculture  whole earth had become  garden “so watching i began  put my interpretation upon  things i had seen    shaped itself  me  evening my interpretation  something  this way afterwards i found i had got only  half truth—or only  glimpse  one facet   truth “it seemed  me  i had happened upon humanity upon  wane the ruddy sunset set me

silver light   northeast the bright little figures ceased  move about below  noiseless owl flitted by  i shivered   chill   night i determined  descend  find where i could sleep “i looked   building i knew then my eye travelled along   figure   white sphinx upon  pedestal  bronze growing distinct   light   rising moon grew brighter i could see  silver birch against it there   tangle  rhododendron bushes black   pale light  there   little lawn i looked   lawn again a queer doubt chilled my complacency ‘no’ said i stoutly  myself ‘that  not  lawn’ “but  was  lawn for  white leprous face   sphinx

dim light i took   small deer i remember too late  night beating  bushes  my clenched fist until my knuckles  gashed  bleeding   broken twigs then sobbing  raving  my anguish  mind i went down   great

absolute wretchedness even anger   folly  leaving  machine having leaked away  my strength i had nothing left but misery then i slept  when i woke again   full day   couple  sparrows  hopping round me

reasonable daylight i could look my circumstances fairly   face i saw  wild folly  my frenzy overnight  i could reason  myself ‘suppose  worst’ i said ‘suppose  machine altogether lost—perhaps destroyed it behoves me   calm  patient  learn  way   people  get  clear idea   method  my loss   means  getting materials  tools so    end perhaps i may make another’ that would  my only hope  poor hope perhaps but better than despair and after all    beautiful  curious world “but probably  machine had only been taken away still i must  calm  patient find  hidingplace  recover   force or cunning and   i scrambled  my feet  looked about me wondering where i could bathe i felt weary stiff  travelsoiled the freshness   morning made me desire  equal freshness i had exhausted my emotion indeed  i went about my business i found myself wondering  my intense excitement overnight i made  careful examination   ground about  little lawn i wasted some time  futile questionings conveyed  well  i  able  such   little people  came by they all failed  understand my gestures some  simply stolid some thought    jest  laughed  me i had  hardest task   world  keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces

my closer attention   pedestal it was  i think i have said  bronze it  not  mere block but highly decorated  deep framed panels  either side i went  rapped  these the pedestal  hollow examining  panels  care i found them discontinuous   frames there  no handles or keyholes but possibly  panels if they  doors  i supposed opened  within one thing  clear enough  my mind it took no very great mental effort  infer  my time machine  inside  pedestal but how  got there   different problem “i saw  heads  two orangeclad people coming through  bushes  under some blossomcovered appletrees towards me i turned smiling  them  beckoned them  me they came  then pointing   bronze pedestal i tried  intimate my wish  open it but  my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly i don’t know how  convey their expression  you suppose you   use  grossly improper gesture   delicateminded woman—it  how she would look they went off  if they had received  last possible insult i tried  sweetlooking little chap  white next  exactly  same result somehow his manner made me feel ashamed  myself but  you know i wanted  time machine  i tried him once more as  turned off like  others my temper got  better  me in three strides i  after him had him   loose part  his robe round  neck  began dragging him towards  sphinx then i saw  horror  repugnance  his face  all   sudden i let him go “but i  not beaten yet i banged  my fist   bronze panels i thought i heard something stir inside—to  explicit i thought i heard  sound like  chuckle—but i must have been mistaken then i got  big pebble   river  came  hammered till i had flattened  coil   decorations   verdigris came off  powdery flakes the delicate little people must have heard me hammering  gusty outbreaks  mile away  either hand but nothing came  it i saw  crowd  them upon  slopes looking furtively  me at last hot  tired i sat down  watch  place but i  too restless  watch long i am too occidental   long vigil i could work   problem  years but  wait inactive  twentyfour hours—that  another matter “i got up after  time  began walking aimlessly through  bushes towards  hill again ‘patience’ said i  myself ‘if you want your machine again you must leave  sphinx alone if they mean  take your machine away it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels  if they don’t you  get  back  soon  you can ask  it to sit among all those unknown things before  puzzle like   hopeless that way lies monomania face this world learn  ways watch it  careful  too hasty guesses   meaning in  end you  find clues   all’ then suddenly  humour   situation came into my mind  thought   years i had spent  study  toil  get into  future age  now my passion  anxiety  get out  it i had made myself  most complicated   most hopeless trap  ever  man devised although    my own expense i could not help myself i laughed aloud “going through  big palace  seemed  me   little people avoided me it may have been my fancy or  may have had something  do  my hammering   gates  bronze yet i felt tolerably sure   avoidance i  careful however  show no concern   abstain  any pursuit  them    course   day or two things got back   old footing i made what progress i could   language   addition i pushed my explorations here  there either i missed some subtle point or their language  excessively simple—almost exclusively composed  concrete

certain feeling you may understand tethered me   circle   few miles round  point  my arrival viii explanation “so far  i could see all  world displayed  same exuberant richness   thames valley from every hill i climbed i saw  same abundance  splendid buildings endlessly varied  material  style  same clustering thickets  evergreens  same blossomladen trees  tree ferns here  there water shone like silver  beyond  land rose into blue undulating hills  so faded into  serenity   sky a peculiar feature which presently attracted my attention   presence  certain circular wells several   seemed  me

discovered   flaring  my matches   steady current  air set down  shafts further i threw  scrap  paper into  throat  one and instead  fluttering slowly down    once sucked swiftly out  sight “after  time too i came  connect these wells  tall towers standing here  there upon  slopes  above them there  often just such  flicker   air  one sees   hot day above  sunscorched beach putting things

see no signs  crematoria nor anything suggestive  tombs but  occurred  me that possibly there might  cemeteries or crematoria somewhere beyond  range  my explorings this again   question i deliberately put  myself  my curiosity   first entirely defeated upon  point the thing puzzled me  i  led  make  further remark which puzzled me still more  aged  infirm among this people there  none

had explored  mere living places great dininghalls  sleeping apartments i could find no machinery no appliances  any kind yet these people  clothed  pleasant fabrics  must  times need renewal  their

her kind  i did not expect any gratitude  her in that however i  wrong “this happened   morning in  afternoon i met my little woman  i believe  was  i  returning towards my centre   exploration  she

but  language they had  apparently different     overworld people so  i  needs left  my own unaided efforts   thought  flight before exploration  even then  my mind but i said  myself ‘you     now’

 eking out  flicker   scrap  paper  my pocket i made good my retreat   narrow tunnel but i had scarce entered this when my light  blown out    blackness i could hear  morlocks rustling like wind among

scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale chinless faces  great lidless pinkishgrey eyes—as they stared  their blindness  bewilderment but i did not stay  look i promise you i retreated again  when my second match had ended i struck my third it had almost burnt through when i reached  opening into  shaft i lay down   edge   throb   great pump below made me giddy then i felt sideways   projecting hooks and  i did so my feet  grasped  behind  i  violently tugged backward i lit my last match …   incontinently went out but i had my hand   climbing bars now and kicking

occasionally darting off  either hand  pick flowers  stick  my pockets my pockets had always puzzled weena but   last she had concluded  they   eccentric kind  vases  floral decoration at least she utilised them   purpose and  reminds me in changing my jacket i found…” the time traveller paused put his hand into his pocket  silently placed two withered flowers not unlike very large white mallows

into night the clear blue   distance faded  one star after another came out the ground grew dim   trees black weena’s fears  her fatigue grew upon her i took her  my arms  talked  her  caressed her

my own troubles  all  gravities  terrestrial life i thought  their unfathomable distance   slow inevitable drift  their movements out   unknown past into  unknown future i thought   great precessional

 night and   confidence  renewed day  almost seemed  me  my fear had been unreasonable i stood up  found my foot   loose heel swollen   ankle  painful under  heel so i sat down again took off my shoes  flung them away “i awakened weena  we went down into  wood now green  pleasant instead  black  forbidding we found some fruit wherewith  break our fast we soon met others   dainty ones laughing  dancing   sunlight  though there  no such thing  nature   night and then i thought once more   meat  i had seen i felt assured now  what  was    bottom  my heart i pitied this last feeble rill   great flood  humanity clearly  some time   longago  human decay  morlocks’ food had run short possibly they had lived  rats  suchlike vermin even now man  far less discriminating  exclusive  his food than  was—far less than any monkey his prejudice against human flesh  no deepseated instinct and so these inhuman sons  men—— i tried  look   thing   scientific spirit after all they  less human  more remote than our cannibal ancestors  three or four thousand years ago and  intelligence  would have made this state  things  torment had gone why should i trouble myself these eloi  mere fatted cattle which  antlike morlocks preserved  preyed upon—probably saw   breeding of and there  weena dancing  my side “then i tried  preserve myself   horror   coming upon me  regarding    rigorous punishment  human selfishness man had been content  live  ease  delight upon  labours  his fellowman had taken necessity  his watchword  excuse    fullness  time necessity had come home  him i even tried  carlylelike scorn  this wretched aristocracy  decay but this attitude  mind  impossible however great their intellectual degradation  eloi had kept too much   human form not  claim my sympathy   make me perforce  sharer  their degradation  their fear “i had   time very vague ideas    course i should pursue my first   secure some safe place  refuge   make myself such arms  metal or stone  i could contrive that necessity  immediate in  next place i hoped  procure some means  fire so  i should have  weapon   torch  hand  nothing i knew would  more efficient against these morlocks then i wanted  arrange some contrivance  break open  doors  bronze under  white sphinx i had  mind  battering ram i had  persuasion  if i could enter those doors  carry  blaze  light before me i should discover  time machine  escape i could not imagine  morlocks  strong enough  move  far away weena i had resolved  bring  me  our own time and turning such schemes over  my mind i pursued our way towards  building which my fancy had chosen  our dwelling xi the palace  green porcelain “i found  palace  green porcelain when we approached  about noon deserted  falling into ruin only ragged vestiges  glass remained   windows  great sheets   green facing had fallen away   corroded metallic framework it lay very high upon  turfy down  looking northeastward before i entered it i  surprised  see  large

“the material   palace proved  examination   indeed porcelain  along  face   i saw  inscription  some unknown character i thought rather foolishly  weena might help me  interpret this but i only learnt   bare idea  writing had never entered her head she always seemed  me i fancy more human than she was perhaps because her affection  so human “within  big valves   door—which  open  broken—we found instead   customary hall  long gallery lit  many side windows at  first glance i  reminded   museum the tiled floor  thick  dust   remarkable array  miscellaneous objects  shrouded   same grey

 upper bones lay beside    thick dust   one place where rainwater had dropped through  leak   roof  thing itself had been worn away further   gallery   huge skeleton barrel   brontosaurus my museum hypothesis  confirmed going towards  side i found what appeared   sloping shelves  clearing away  thick dust i found  old familiar glass cases  our own time but they must have been airtight  judge

inevitable process  decay  had been staved off   time  had through  extinction  bacteria  fungi lost ninetynine hundredths   force  nevertheless  extreme sureness if  extreme slowness  work again upon all  treasures here  there i found traces   little people   shape  rare fossils broken  pieces or threaded  strings upon reeds and  cases had  some instances been bodily removed—by  morlocks  i judged the place  very silent the thick dust deadened our footsteps weena who had been rolling  sea urchin down  sloping glass   case presently came  i stared about me  very quietly took my hand  stood beside me “and  first i  so much surprised  this ancient monument   intellectual age  i gave no thought   possibilities  presented even my preoccupation about  time machine receded  little  my mind “to judge   size   place this palace  green porcelain had  great deal more   than  gallery  palæontology possibly historical galleries  might be even  library to me  least  my present circumstances these would  vastly more interesting than this spectacle  oldtime geology  decay exploring i found another short gallery running transversely   first this appeared   devoted  minerals   sight   block  sulphur set my mind running  gunpowder but i could find no saltpetre indeed no nitrates  any kind doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago yet  sulphur hung  my mind  set up  train  thinking as   rest   contents   gallery though   whole they   best preserved  all i saw i had little interest i am no specialist  mineralogy  i went  down  very ruinous aisle running parallel   first hall i had entered apparently this section had been devoted  natural history but everything had long since passed out  recognition a few shrivelled  blackened vestiges  what had once been stuffed animals desiccated mummies  jars  had once held spirit  brown dust  departed plants   all i  sorry  that because i should have been glad  trace  patient readjustments  which  conquest  animated nature had been attained then we came   gallery  simply colossal proportions but singularly illlit  floor   running downward   slight angle   end  which i entered at intervals white globes hung   ceiling—many  them cracked  smashed—which suggested  originally  place had been artificially lit here i  more  my element  rising  either side  me   huge bulks  big machines all greatly corroded  many broken down but some still fairly complete you know i have  certain weakness  mechanism  i  inclined  linger among these  more so    most part they had  interest  puzzles  i could make only  vaguest guesses  what they  for i fancied  if i could solve their puzzles i should find myself  possession  powers  might   use against  morlocks “suddenly weena came very close  my side so suddenly  she startled me had  not been  her i do not think i should have noticed   floor   gallery sloped  all footnote it may be  course   floor did not slope but   museum  built into  side   hill—ed the end i had come    quite above ground   lit  rare slitlike windows as you went down  length  ground came up against these windows until  last there   pit like  ‘area‘   london house before each  only  narrow line  daylight   top i went slowly along puzzling about  machines  had been too intent upon them  notice  gradual diminution   light until weena’s increasing apprehensions drew my attention then i saw   gallery ran down  last into  thick darkness i hesitated  then  i looked round me i saw   dust  less abundant   surface less even further away towards  dimness  appeared   broken   number  small narrow footprints my sense   immediate presence   morlocks revived  that i felt  i  wasting my time   academic examination  machinery i called  mind    already far advanced   afternoon   i had still no weapon no refuge  no means  making  fire and then down   remote blackness   gallery i heard  peculiar pattering   same odd noises i had heard down  well “i took weena’s hand then struck   sudden idea i left her  turned   machine  which projected  lever not unlike those   signalbox clambering upon  stand  grasping this lever  my hands i put all my weight upon  sideways suddenly weena deserted   central aisle began  whimper i had judged  strength   lever pretty correctly   snapped after  minute’s strain  i rejoined her   mace  my hand more than sufficient i judged  any morlock skull i might encounter and i longed very much  kill  morlock or so very inhuman you may think  want  go killing one’s own descendants but   impossible somehow  feel any humanity   things only my disinclination  leave weena   persuasion  if i began  slake my thirst  murder my time machine might suffer restrained me  going straight down  gallery  killing  brutes i heard “well mace  one hand  weena   other i went out   gallery  into another  still larger one which   first glance reminded me   military chapel hung  tattered flags the brown  charred rags  hung   sides  it i presently recognised   decaying vestiges  books they had long since dropped  pieces  every semblance  print had left them but here  there  warped boards  cracked metallic clasps  told  tale well enough had i been  literary man i might perhaps have moralised upon  futility  all ambition but   was  thing  struck me  keenest force   enormous waste  labour  which this sombre wilderness  rotting paper testified at  time i  confess  i thought chiefly   philosophical transactions  my own seventeen papers upon physical optics “then going up  broad staircase we came  what may once have been  gallery  technical chemistry and here i had not  little hope  useful discoveries except  one end where  roof had collapsed this gallery  well preserved i went eagerly  every unbroken case and  last  one   really airtight cases i found  box  matches very eagerly i tried them they  perfectly good they  not even damp i turned  weena ‘dance’ i cried  her  her own tongue for now i had  weapon indeed against  horrible creatures we feared and so   derelict museum upon  thick soft carpeting  dust  weena’s huge delight i solemnly performed  kind  composite dance whistling the land   leal  cheerfully  i could in part    modest cancan  part  step dance  part  skirt dance so far  my tailcoat permitted   part original for i am naturally inventive  you know “now i still think   this box  matches  have escaped  wear  time  immemorial years   most strange   me    most fortunate thing yet oddly enough i found  far unlikelier substance    camphor i found    sealed jar   chance i suppose had been really hermetically sealed i fancied  first    paraffin wax  smashed  glass accordingly but  odour  camphor  unmistakable in  universal decay this volatile substance had chanced  survive perhaps through many thousands  centuries it reminded me   sepia painting

excellent candle—and i put   my pocket i found no explosives however nor any means  breaking down  bronze doors as yet my iron crowbar   most helpful thing i had chanced upon nevertheless i left  gallery greatly elated “i cannot tell you all  story   long afternoon it would require  great effort  memory  recall my explorations   all  proper order i remember  long gallery  rusting stands  arms  how i hesitated between my crowbar   hatchet or  sword i could not carry both however  my bar  iron promised best against  bronze gates there  numbers  guns pistols  rifles the most  masses  rust but many   some new metal  still fairly sound but any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust one corner i saw  charred  shattered perhaps i thought   explosion among  specimens

south america  particularly took my fancy “as  evening drew on my interest waned i went through gallery after gallery dusty silent often ruinous  exhibits sometimes mere heaps  rust  lignite sometimes fresher in one place i suddenly found myself near  model   tin mine  then   merest accident i discovered   airtight case two dynamite cartridges i shouted ‘eureka’  smashed  case  joy then came  doubt i hesitated then selecting  little side gallery i made my essay i never felt such  disappointment  i did  waiting five ten fifteen minutes   explosion  never came of course  things  dummies  i might have guessed  their presence i really believe  had they not been so i should have rushed off incontinently  blown sphinx bronze doors  as  proved my chances  finding  time machine all together into nonexistence “it  after that i think  we came   little open court within  palace it  turfed  had three fruittrees so we rested  refreshed ourselves towards sunset i began  consider our position night  creeping upon us  my inaccessible hidingplace had still   found but  troubled me very little now i had  my possession  thing  was perhaps  best  all defences against  morlocks—i had matches i had  camphor  my pocket too if  blaze  needed it seemed  me   best thing we could do would   pass  night   open protected   fire in  morning there   getting   time machine towards that  yet i had only my iron mace but now  my growing knowledge i felt very differently towards those bronze doors up  this i had refrained  forcing them largely because   mystery   other side they had never impressed me  being very strong  i hoped  find my bar  iron not altogether inadequate   work xii in  darkness “we emerged   palace while  sun  still  part above  horizon i  determined  reach  white sphinx early  next morning  ere  dusk i purposed pushing through  woods  had stopped me   previous journey my plan   go  far  possible  night  then building  fire  sleep   protection   glare accordingly  we went along i gathered any sticks or dried grass i saw  presently had my arms full  such litter thus loaded our progress  slower than i had anticipated  besides weena  tired and i also began  suffer  sleepiness too so    full night before we reached  wood upon  shrubby hill   edge weena would have stopped fearing  darkness before us but  singular sense  impending calamity  should indeed have served me   warning drove me onward i had been without sleep   night  two days  i  feverish  irritable i felt sleep coming upon me   morlocks  it “while we hesitated among  black bushes behind us  dim against their blackness i saw three crouching figures there  scrub  long grass all about us  i did not feel safe  their insidious approach the forest i calculated  rather less than  mile across if we could get through    bare hillside there   seemed  me   altogether safer restingplace i thought   my matches  my camphor i could contrive  keep my path illuminated through  woods yet   evident  if i   flourish matches  my hands i should have  abandon my firewood so rather reluctantly i put  down and then  came into my head  i would amaze our friends behind  lighting it i   discover  atrocious folly  this proceeding but  came  my mind   ingenious move  covering our retreat “i don’t know if you have ever thought what  rare thing flame must    absence  man    temperate climate the sun’s heat  rarely strong enough  burn even when   focused  dewdrops   sometimes  case  more tropical districts lightning may blast  blacken but  rarely gives rise  widespread fire decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder   heat   fermentation but this rarely results  flame in this decadence too  art  firemaking had been forgotten   earth the red tongues  went licking up my heap  wood   altogether new  strange thing  weena “she wanted  run    play  it i believe she would have cast herself into  had i not restrained her but i caught her up   spite  her struggles plunged boldly before me into  wood for  little way  glare  my fire lit  path looking back presently i could see through  crowded stems   my heap  sticks  blaze had spread  some bushes adjacent   curved line  fire  creeping up  grass   hill i laughed  that  turned again   dark trees before me it  very black  weena clung  me convulsively but there  still  my eyes grew accustomed   darkness sufficient light  me  avoid  stems overhead   simply black except where  gap  remote blue sky shone down upon us here  there i lit none  my matches because i had no hand free upon my left arm i carried my little one  my right hand i had my iron bar “for some way i heard nothing but  crackling twigs under my feet  faint rustle   breeze above  my own breathing   throb   bloodvessels  my ears then i seemed  know   pattering behind me i pushed  grimly the pattering grew more distinct  then i caught  same queer sound  voices i had heard   underworld there  evidently several   morlocks  they  closing  upon me indeed  another minute i felt  tug  my coat then something  my arm and weena shivered violently  became quite still “it  time   match but  get one i must put her down i did so and  i fumbled  my pocket  struggle began   darkness about my knees perfectly silent  her part    same peculiar cooing sounds   morlocks soft little hands too  creeping over my coat  back touching even my neck then  match scratched  fizzed i held  flaring  saw  white backs   morlocks  flight amid  trees i hastily took  lump  camphor  my pocket  prepared  light   soon   match should wane then i looked  weena she  lying clutching my feet  quite motionless  her face   ground with  sudden fright i stooped  her she seemed scarcely  breathe i lit  block  camphor  flung    ground    split  flared up  drove back  morlocks   shadows i knelt down  lifted her the wood behind seemed full   stir  murmur   great company “she seemed  have fainted i put her carefully upon my shoulder  rose  push on  then there came  horrible realisation in manœuvring  my matches  weena i had turned myself about several times  now i had not  faintest idea  what direction lay my path for all i knew i might  facing back towards  palace  green porcelain i found myself   cold sweat i had  think rapidly what  do i determined  build  fire  encamp where we were i put weena still motionless down upon  turfy bole  very hastily  my first lump  camphor waned i began collecting sticks  leaves here  there out   darkness round me  morlocks’ eyes shone like carbuncles “the camphor flickered  went out i lit  match   i did so two white forms  had been approaching weena dashed hastily away one  so blinded   light   came straight  me  i felt his bones grind under  blow  my fist he gave  whoop  dismay staggered  little way  fell down i lit another piece  camphor  went  gathering my bonfire presently i noticed how dry  some   foliage above me  since my arrival   time machine  matter   week no rain had fallen so instead  casting about among  trees  fallen twigs i began leaping up  dragging down branches very soon i had  choking smoky fire  green wood  dry sticks  could economise my camphor then i turned  where weena lay beside my iron mace i tried what i could  revive her but she lay like one dead i could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed “now  smoke   fire beat over towards me   must have made me heavy   sudden moreover  vapour  camphor    air my fire would not need replenishing   hour or so i felt very weary after my exertion  sat down the wood too  full   slumbrous murmur  i did not understand i seemed just  nod  open my eyes but all  dark   morlocks had their hands upon me flinging off their clinging fingers i hastily felt  my pocket   matchbox and—it had gone then they gripped  closed  me again in  moment i knew what had happened i had slept  my fire had gone out   bitterness  death came over my soul the forest seemed full   smell  burning wood i  caught   neck   hair   arms  pulled down it  indescribably horrible   darkness  feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me i felt  if i    monstrous spider’s web i  overpowered  went down i felt little teeth nipping  my neck i rolled over   i did so my hand came against my iron lever it gave me strength i struggled up shaking  human rats  me and holding  bar short i thrust where i judged their faces might be i could feel  succulent giving  flesh  bone under my blows    moment i  free “the strange exultation  so often seems  accompany hard fighting came upon me i knew  both i  weena  lost but i determined  make  morlocks pay  their meat i stood  my back   tree swinging  iron bar before me the whole wood  full   stir  cries  them a minute passed their voices seemed  rise   higher pitch  excitement  their movements grew faster yet none came within reach i stood glaring   blackness then suddenly came hope what if  morlocks  afraid and close   heels   came  strange thing the darkness seemed  grow luminous very dimly i began  see  morlocks about me—three battered  my feet—and then i recognised  incredulous surprise   others  running   incessant stream   seemed  behind me  away through  wood  front and their backs seemed no longer white but reddish as i stood agape i saw  little red spark go drifting across  gap  starlight between  branches  vanish and   i understood  smell  burning wood  slumbrous murmur   growing now into  gusty roar  red glow   morlocks’ flight “stepping out  behind my tree  looking back i saw through  black pillars   nearer trees  flames   burning forest it  my first fire coming after me with  i looked  weena but she  gone the hissing  crackling behind me  explosive thud  each fresh tree burst into flame left little time  reflection my iron bar still gripped i followed   morlocks’ path it   close race once  flames crept forward so swiftly  my right  i ran  i  outflanked  had  strike off   left but  last i emerged upon  small open space   i did so  morlock came blundering towards me  past me  went  straight into  fire “and now i   see  most weird  horrible thing i think  all  i beheld   future age this whole space   bright  day   reflection   fire in  centre   hillock or tumulus surmounted   scorched hawthorn beyond this  another arm   burning forest  yellow tongues already writhing  it completely encircling  space   fence  fire upon  hillside  some thirty or forty morlocks dazzled   light  heat  blundering hither  thither against each other  their bewilderment at first i did not realise their blindness  struck furiously  them  my bar   frenzy  fear  they approached me killing one  crippling several more but when i had watched  gestures  one  them groping under  hawthorn against  red sky  heard their moans i  assured  their absolute helplessness  misery   glare  i struck no more  them “yet every now  then one would come straight towards me setting loose  quivering horror  made me quick  elude him at one time  flames died down somewhat  i feared  foul creatures would presently  able  see me i  thinking  beginning  fight  killing some  them before this should happen but  fire burst out again brightly  i stayed my hand i walked about  hill among them  avoided them looking  some trace  weena but weena  gone “at last i sat down   summit   hillock  watched this strange incredible company  blind things groping   fro  making uncanny noises  each other   glare   fire beat  them the coiling uprush  smoke streamed across  sky  through  rare tatters   red canopy remote  though they belonged  another universe shone  little stars two or three morlocks came blundering into me  i drove them off  blows  my fists trembling  i did so “for  most part   night i  persuaded    nightmare i bit myself  screamed   passionate desire  awake i beat  ground  my hands  got up  sat down again  wandered here  there  again sat down then i would fall  rubbing my eyes  calling upon god  let me awake thrice i saw morlocks put their heads down   kind  agony  rush into  flames but  last above  subsiding red   fire above  streaming masses  black smoke   whitening  blackening tree stumps   diminishing numbers  these dim creatures came  white light   day “i searched again  traces  weena but there  none it  plain  they had left her poor little body   forest i cannot describe how  relieved me  think   had escaped  awful fate  which  seemed destined as i thought  that i  almost moved  begin  massacre   helpless abominations about me but i contained myself the hillock  i have said   kind  island   forest from  summit i could now make out through  haze  smoke  palace  green porcelain    i could get my bearings   white sphinx and so leaving  remnant  these damned souls still going hither  thither  moaning   day grew clearer i tied some grass about my feet  limped  across smoking ashes  among black stems  still pulsated internally  fire towards  hidingplace   time machine i walked slowly  i  almost exhausted  well  lame  i felt  intensest wretchedness   horrible death  little weena it seemed  overwhelming calamity now  this old familiar room   more like  sorrow   dream than  actual loss but  morning  left me absolutely lonely again—terribly alone i began  think  this house  mine  this fireside  some  you   such thoughts came  longing   pain “but  i walked over  smoking ashes under  bright morning sky i made  discovery in my trouser pocket  still some loose matches the box must have leaked before   lost xiii the trap   white sphinx “about eight or nine   morning i came   same seat  yellow metal  which i had viewed  world upon  evening  my arrival i thought  my hasty conclusions upon  evening  could not refrain  laughing bitterly  my confidence here   same beautiful scene  same abundant foliage  same splendid palaces  magnificent ruins  same silver river running between  fertile banks the gay robes   beautiful people moved hither  thither among  trees some  bathing  exactly  place where i had saved weena   suddenly gave me  keen stab  pain and like blots upon  landscape rose  cupolas above  ways   underworld i understood now what all  beauty   overworld people covered very pleasant  their day  pleasant   day   cattle   field like  cattle they knew  no enemies  provided against no needs and their end   same “i grieved  think how brief  dream   human intellect had been it had committed suicide it had set itself steadfastly towards comfort  ease  balanced society  security  permanency   watchword  had attained  hopes—to come  this  last once life  property must have reached almost absolute safety the rich had been

instinct  useless there  no intelligence where there  no change  no need  change only those animals partake  intelligence  have  meet  huge variety  needs  dangers “so  i see it  upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness   underworld  mere mechanical industry but  perfect state had lacked one thing even  mechanical perfection—absolute permanency apparently  time went on  feeding   underworld however   effected had become disjointed mother necessity who had been staved off   few thousand years came back again  she began below the underworld being  contact  machinery which however perfect still needs some little thought outside habit had probably retained perforce rather more initiative if less  every other human character than  upper and when other meat failed them they turned  what old habit had hitherto forbidden so i say i saw   my last view   world  eight hundred  two thousand seven hundred  one it may   wrong  explanation  mortal wit could invent it  how  thing shaped itself  me    i give   you “after  fatigues excitements  terrors   past days   spite  my grief this seat   tranquil view   warm sunlight  very pleasant i  very tired  sleepy  soon my theorising passed into dozing catching myself  that i took my own hint  spreading myself out upon  turf i had  long  refreshing sleep “i awoke  little before sunsetting i now felt safe against being caught napping   morlocks and stretching myself i came  down  hill towards  white sphinx i had my crowbar  one hand   other hand played   matches  my pocket “and now came  most unexpected thing as i approached  pedestal   sphinx i found  bronze valves  open they had slid down into grooves “at  i stopped short before them hesitating  enter “within   small apartment    raised place   corner  this   time machine i had  small levers  my pocket so here after all my elaborate preparations   siege   white sphinx   meek surrender i threw my iron bar away almost sorry not  use it “a sudden thought came into my head  i stooped towards  portal for once  least i grasped  mental operations   morlocks suppressing  strong inclination  laugh i stepped through  bronze frame  up   time machine i  surprised  find  had been carefully oiled  cleaned i have suspected since   morlocks had even partially taken   pieces while trying  their dim way  grasp  purpose “now  i stood  examined it finding  pleasure   mere touch   contrivance  thing i had expected happened the bronze panels suddenly slid up  struck  frame   clang i    dark—trapped so  morlocks thought at  i chuckled gleefully “i could already hear their murmuring laughter  they came towards me very calmly i tried  strike  match i had only  fix   levers  depart then like  ghost but i had overlooked one little thing the matches    abominable kind  light only   box “you may imagine how all my calm vanished the little brutes  close upon me one touched me i made  sweeping blow   dark  them   levers  began  scramble into  saddle   machine then came one hand upon me  then another then i had simply  fight against their persistent fingers  my levers    same time feel   studs over which these fitted one indeed they almost got away  me as  slipped  my hand i had  butt   dark  my head—i could hear  morlock’s skull ring—to recover it it   nearer thing than  fight   forest i think this last scramble “but  last  lever  fixed  pulled over the clinging hands slipped  me the darkness presently fell  my eyes i found myself   same grey light  tumult i have already described xiv the further vision “i have already told you   sickness  confusion  comes  time travelling and this time i  not seated properly   saddle but sideways    unstable fashion for  indefinite time i clung   machine   swayed  vibrated quite unheeding how i went  when i brought myself  look   dials again i  amazed  find where i had arrived one dial records days  another thousands  days another millions  days  another thousands  millions now instead  reversing  levers i had pulled them over so   go forward  them  when i came  look  these indicators i found   thousands hand  sweeping round  fast   seconds hand   watch—into futurity “as i drove on  peculiar change crept over  appearance  things the palpitating greyness grew darker then—though i  still travelling  prodigious velocity—the blinking succession  day  night which  usually indicative   slower pace returned  grew more  more marked this puzzled me very much  first the alternations  night  day grew slower  slower  so did  passage   sun across  sky until they seemed  stretch through centuries at last  steady twilight brooded over  earth  twilight only broken now  then when  comet glared across  darkling sky the band  light  had indicated  sun had long since disappeared   sun had ceased  set—it simply rose  fell   west  grew ever broader  more red all trace   moon had vanished the circling   stars growing slower  slower had given place  creeping points  light at last some time before i stopped  sun red  very large halted motionless upon  horizon  vast dome glowing   dull heat  now  then suffering  momentary extinction at one time  had   little while glowed more brilliantly again but  speedily reverted   sullen red heat i perceived  this slowing down   rising  setting   work   tidal drag  done the earth had come  rest  one face   sun even   our own time  moon faces  earth very cautiously  i remembered my former headlong fall i began  reverse my motion slower  slower went  circling hands until  thousands one seemed motionless   daily one  no longer  mere mist upon  scale still slower until  dim outlines   desolate beach grew visible “i stopped very gently  sat upon  time machine looking round the sky  no longer blue northeastward   inky black  out   blackness shone brightly  steadily  pale white stars overhead    deep indian red  starless  southeastward  grew brighter   glowing scarlet where cut   horizon lay  huge hull   sun red  motionless the rocks about me    harsh reddish colour  all  trace  life  i could see  first   intensely green vegetation  covered every projecting point  their southeastern face it   same rich green  one sees  forest moss or   lichen  caves plants which like these grow   perpetual twilight “the machine  standing   sloping beach the sea stretched away   southwest  rise into  sharp bright horizon against  wan sky there  no breakers  no waves  not  breath  wind  stirring only  slight oily swell rose  fell like  gentle breathing  showed   eternal sea  still moving  living and along  margin where  water sometimes broke   thick incrustation  salt—pink under  lurid sky there   sense  oppression  my head  i noticed  i  breathing very fast the sensation reminded me  my only experience  mountaineering    i judged  air   more rarefied than   now “far away up  desolate slope i heard  harsh scream  saw  thing like  huge white butterfly go slanting  fluttering up into  sky and circling disappear over some low hillocks beyond the sound   voice  so dismal  i shivered  seated myself more firmly upon  machine looking round me again i saw that quite near what i had taken    reddish mass  rock  moving slowly towards me then i saw  thing  really  monstrous crablike creature can you imagine  crab  large  yonder table   many legs moving slowly  uncertainly  big claws swaying  long antennæ like carters’ whips waving  feeling   stalked eyes gleaming  you  either side   metallic front its back  corrugated  ornamented  ungainly bosses   greenish incrustation blotched  here  there i could see  many palps   complicated mouth flickering  feeling   moved “as i stared  this sinister apparition crawling towards me i felt  tickling  my cheek  though  fly had lighted there i tried  brush  away  my hand but   moment  returned  almost immediately came another  my ear i struck  this  caught something threadlike it  drawn swiftly out  my hand with  frightful qualm i turned  i saw  i had grasped  antenna  another monster crab  stood just behind me its evil eyes  wriggling  their stalks  mouth  all alive  appetite   vast ungainly claws smeared   algal slime  descending upon me in  moment my hand    lever  i had placed  month between myself  these monsters but i  still   same beach  i saw them distinctly now  soon  i stopped dozens  them seemed   crawling here  there   sombre light among  foliated sheets  intense green “i cannot convey  sense  abominable desolation  hung over  world the red eastern sky  northward blackness  salt dead sea  stony beach crawling  these foul slowstirring monsters  uniform poisonouslooking green   lichenous plants  thin air  hurts one’s lungs all contributed   appalling effect i moved   hundred years  there   same red sun—a little larger  little duller—the same dying sea  same chill air   same crowd  earthy crustacea creeping   out among  green weed   red rocks and   westward sky i saw  curved pale line like  vast new moon “so i travelled stopping ever  again  great strides   thousand years or more drawn    mystery   earth’s fate watching   strange fascination  sun grow larger  duller   westward sky   life   old earth ebb away at last more than thirty million years hence  huge redhot dome   sun had come  obscure nearly  tenth part   darkling heavens then i stopped once more   crawling multitude  crabs had disappeared   red beach save   livid green liverworts  lichens seemed lifeless and now   flecked  white a bitter cold assailed me rare white flakes ever  again came eddying down to  northeastward  glare  snow lay under  starlight   sable sky  i could see  undulating crest  hillocks pinkish white there  fringes  ice along  sea margin  drifting masses farther out but  main expanse   salt ocean all bloody under  eternal sunset  still unfrozen “i looked about me  see if any traces  animal life remained a certain indefinable apprehension still kept me   saddle   machine but i saw nothing moving  earth or sky or sea the green slime   rocks alone testified  life  not extinct a shallow sandbank had appeared   sea   water had receded   beach i fancied i saw some black object flopping about upon this bank but  became motionless  i looked  it  i judged  my eye had been deceived    black object  merely  rock the stars   sky  intensely bright  seemed  me  twinkle very little “suddenly i noticed   circular westward outline   sun had changed   concavity  bay had appeared   curve i saw this grow larger for  minute perhaps i stared aghast  this blackness   creeping over  day  then i realised   eclipse  beginning either  moon or  planet mercury  passing across  sun’s disk naturally  first i took     moon but there  much  incline me  believe  what i really saw   transit   inner planet passing very near   earth “the darkness grew apace  cold wind began  blow  freshening gusts   east   showering white flakes   air increased  number from  edge   sea came  ripple  whisper beyond these lifeless sounds  world  silent silent it would  hard  convey  stillness  it all  sounds  man  bleating  sheep  cries  birds  hum  insects  stir  makes  background  our lives—all   over as  darkness thickened  eddying flakes grew more abundant dancing before my eyes   cold   air more intense at last one  one swiftly one after  other  white peaks   distant hills vanished into blackness the breeze rose   moaning wind i saw  black central shadow   eclipse sweeping towards me in another moment  pale stars alone  visible all else  rayless obscurity the sky  absolutely black “a horror  this great darkness came  me the cold  smote  my marrow   pain i felt  breathing overcame me i shivered   deadly nausea seized me then like  redhot bow   sky appeared  edge   sun i got off  machine  recover myself i felt giddy  incapable  facing  return journey as i stood sick  confused i saw again  moving thing upon  shoal—there  no mistake now     moving thing—against  red water   sea it   round thing  size   football perhaps or  may be bigger  tentacles trailed down  it  seemed black against  weltering bloodred water    hopping fitfully about then i felt i  fainting but  terrible dread  lying helpless   remote  awful twilight sustained me while i clambered upon  saddle xv the time traveller’s return “so i came back for  long time i must have been insensible upon  machine the blinking succession   days  nights  resumed  sun got golden again  sky blue i breathed  greater freedom the fluctuating contours   land ebbed  flowed the hands spun backward upon  dials at last i saw again  dim shadows  houses  evidences  decadent humanity these too changed  passed  others came presently when  million dial   zero i slackened speed i began  recognise our own pretty  familiar architecture  thousands hand ran back   startingpoint  night  day flapped slower  slower then  old walls   laboratory came round me very gently now i slowed  mechanism down “i saw one little thing  seemed odd  me i think i have told you  when i set out before my velocity became very high mrs watchett had walked across  room travelling   seemed  me like  rocket as i returned i passed again across  minute when she traversed  laboratory but now her every motion appeared    exact inversion  her previous ones the door   lower end opened  she glided quietly up  laboratory back foremost  disappeared behind  door  which she had previously entered just before  i seemed  see hillyer   moment but  passed like  flash “then i stopped  machine  saw about me again  old familiar laboratory my tools my appliances just  i had left them i got off  thing very shakily  sat down upon my bench for several minutes i trembled violently then i became calmer around me  my old workshop again exactly   had been i might have slept there   whole thing have been  dream “and yet not exactly the thing had started   southeast corner   laboratory it had come  rest again   northwest against  wall where you saw it that gives you  exact distance  my little lawn   pedestal   white sphinx into which  morlocks had carried my machine “for  time my brain went stagnant presently i got up  came through  passage here limping because my heel  still painful  feeling sorely begrimed i saw  pall mall gazette   table   door i found  date  indeed today  looking   timepiece saw  hour  almost eight o’clock i heard your voices   clatter  plates i hesitated—i felt so sick  weak then i sniffed good wholesome meat  opened  door  you you know  rest i washed  dined  now i am telling you  story xvi after  story “i know”  said after  pause “that all this   absolutely incredible  you but  me  one incredible thing   i am here tonight  this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces  telling you these strange adventures” he looked   medical man “no i cannot expect you  believe it take    lie—or  prophecy say i dreamed    workshop consider i have been speculating upon  destinies  our race until i have hatched this fiction treat my assertion   truth   mere stroke  art  enhance  interest and taking    story what do you think  it” he took up his pipe  began  his old accustomed manner  tap   nervously upon  bars   grate there   momentary stillness then chairs began  creak  shoes  scrape upon  carpet i took my eyes off  time traveller’s face  looked round  his audience they    dark  little spots  colour swam before them the medical man seemed absorbed   contemplation  our host the editor  looking hard   end  his cigar—the sixth the journalist fumbled  his watch the others  far  i remember  motionless the editor stood up   sigh “what  pity   you’re not  writer  stories”  said putting his hand   time traveller’s shoulder “you don’t believe it” “well——” “i thought not” the time traveller turned  us “where   matches”  said he lit one  spoke over his pipe puffing “to tell you  truth i hardly believe  myself and yet” his eye fell   mute inquiry upon  withered white flowers upon  little table then  turned over  hand holding his pipe  i saw   looking  some halfhealed scars  his knuckles the medical man rose came   lamp  examined  flowers “the gynæceum’s odd”  said the psychologist leant forward  see holding out his hand   specimen “i’m hanged if  isn’t  quarter  one” said  journalist “how shall we get home” “plenty  cabs   station” said  psychologist “it’s  curious thing” said  medical man “but i certainly don’t know  natural order  these flowers may i have them” the time traveller hesitated then suddenly “certainly not” “where did you really get them” said  medical man the time traveller put his hand  his head he spoke like one who  trying  keep hold   idea  eluded him “they  put into my pocket  weena when i travelled into time” he stared round  room “i’m damned if  isn’t all going this room  you   atmosphere  every day  too much  my memory did i ever make  time machine or  model   time machine or   all only  dream they say life   dream  precious poor dream  times—but i can’t stand another  won’t fit it’s madness and where did  dream come from … i must look   machine if there  one” he caught up  lamp swiftly  carried it flaring red through  door into  corridor we followed him there   flickering light   lamp   machine sure enough squat ugly  askew  thing  brass ebony ivory  translucent glimmering quartz solid   touch—for i put out my hand  felt  rail  it—and  brown spots  smears upon  ivory  bits  grass  moss upon  lower parts  one rail bent awry the time traveller put  lamp down   bench  ran his hand along  damaged rail “it’s all right now”  said “the story i told you  true i’m sorry  have brought you out here   cold” he took up  lamp and   absolute silence we returned   smokingroom he came into  hall  us  helped  editor   his coat the medical man looked into his face and   certain hesitation told him   suffering  overwork  which  laughed hugely i remember him standing   open doorway bawling goodnight i shared  cab   editor he thought  tale  “gaudy lie” for my own part i  unable  come   conclusion the story  so fantastic  incredible  telling so credible  sober i lay awake most   night thinking about it i determined  go next day  see  time traveller again i  told     laboratory  being  easy terms   house i went up  him the laboratory however  empty i stared   minute   time machine  put out my hand  touched  lever at   squat substantiallooking mass swayed like  bough shaken   wind its instability startled me extremely  i had  queer reminiscence   childish days when i used   forbidden  meddle i came back through  corridor the time traveller met me   smokingroom he  coming   house he had  small camera under one arm   knapsack under  other he laughed when  saw me  gave me  elbow  shake “i’m frightfully busy” said he “with  thing  there” “but   not some hoax” i said “do you really travel through time” “really  truly i do” and  looked frankly into my eyes he hesitated his eye wandered about  room “i only want half  hour”  said “i know why you came  it’s awfully good  you there’s some magazines here if you’ll stop  lunch i’ll prove you this time travelling up   hilt specimens  all if you’ll forgive my leaving you now” i consented hardly comprehending then  full import  his words   nodded  went  down  corridor i heard  door   laboratory slam seated myself   chair  took up  daily paper what   going  do before lunchtime then suddenly i  reminded   advertisement  i had promised  meet richardson  publisher  two i looked  my watch  saw  i could barely save  engagement i got up  went down  passage  tell  time traveller as i took hold   handle   door i heard  exclamation oddly truncated   end   click   thud a gust  air whirled round me  i opened  door   within came  sound  broken glass falling   floor the time traveller  not there i seemed  see  ghostly indistinct figure sitting   whirling mass  black  brass   moment—a figure so transparent   bench behind   sheets  drawings  absolutely distinct but this phantasm vanished  i rubbed my eyes the time machine had gone save   subsiding stir  dust  further end   laboratory  empty a pane   skylight had apparently just been blown in i felt  unreasonable amazement i knew  something strange had happened    moment could not distinguish what  strange thing might be as i stood staring  door into  garden opened   manservant appeared we looked  each other then ideas began  come “has mr —— gone out  way” said i “no sir no one  come out this way i  expecting  find him here” at  i understood at  risk  disappointing richardson i stayed on waiting   time traveller waiting   second perhaps still stranger story   specimens  photographs  would bring  him but i am beginning now  fear  i must wait  lifetime the time traveller vanished three years ago and  everybody knows now   never returned epilogue one
