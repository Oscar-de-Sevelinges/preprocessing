midnight companion  bethought himself   adventure  brom bones   galloping hessian now quickened his steed  hopes  leaving him behind the stranger however quickened his horse   equal pace ichabod pulled up  fell into  walk thinking  lag behindthe other did  same his heart began  sink within him  endeavored  resume his psalm tune but his parched tongue clove   roof  his mouth   could not utter  stave there  something   moody  dogged silence  this pertinacious companion   mysterious  appalling it  soon fearfully accounted for on mounting  rising ground which brought  figure  his
