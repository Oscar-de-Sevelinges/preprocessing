weltering  his side one next himself  power  next  crime long after known  palestine  named beelzebub to whom th’ archenemy and thence  heaven called satan  bold words breaking  horrid silence thus began— “if thou beest he—but o how fallen how changed from him who   happy realms  light clothed  transcendent brightness didst outshine myriads though bright—if  whom mutual league united thoughts  counsels equal hope and hazard   glorious enterprise joined  me once now misery hath joined in equal ruin into what pit thou seest from what height fallen so much  stronger proved he  his thunder

advanced we may  more successful hope resolve to wage  force or guile eternal war irreconcilable  our grand foe who now triumphs   th’ excess  joy sole reigning holds  tyranny  heaven” so spake th’ apostate angel though  pain vaunting aloud but racked  deep despair and him thus answered soon his bold compeer— “o prince o chief  many throned powers that led th’ embattled seraphim  war under thy conduct and  dreadful deeds fearless endangered heaven’s perpetual king and put  proof his high supremacy whether upheld  strength or chance or fate too well i see  rue  dire event that  sad overthrow  foul defeat hath lost us heaven  all this mighty host in horrible destruction laid thus low as far  gods  heavenly essences can perish   mind  spirit remains invincible  vigour soon returns though

archfiend replied— “fallen cherub   weak  miserable doing or suffering but  this  sure— to do aught good never   our task but ever  do ill our sole delight as being  contrary  his high  whom we resist if then his providence out  our evil seek  bring forth good our labour must   pervert  end and out  good still  find means  evil which ofttimes may succeed so  perhaps shall grieve him if i fail not

supernal power “is this  region this  soil  clime” said then  lost archangel “this  seat that we must change  heaven—this mournful gloom for  celestial light be  so since  who now  sovereign can

oblivious pool and call them not  share  us their part in this unhappy mansion or once more with rallied arms  try what may  yet regained  heaven or what more lost  hell” so satan spake  him beelzebub thus answered—“leader  those armies bright which but th’ omnipotent none could have foiled if once they hear  voice their liveliest pledge of hope  fears  dangers—heard so oft in worst extremes    perilous edge of battle when  raged  all assaults their surest signal—they  soon resume new courage  revive though now they lie grovelling  prostrate  yon lake  fire as we erewhile astounded  amazed

torrid clime smote  him sore besides vaulted  fire nathless  so endured till   beach of  inflamed sea  stood  called his legions—angel forms who lay entranced thick  autumnal leaves  strow  brooks in

while  perfidious hatred they pursued the sojourners  goshen who beheld from  safe shore their floating carcases and broken chariotwheels so thick bestrown abject  lost lay these covering  flood under

on th’ other side up rose belial  act more graceful  humane a fairer person lost not heaven  seemed for dignity composed  high exploit but all  false  hollow though his tongue dropped manna  could make  worse appear the better reason  perplex  dash maturest counsels  his thoughts  low— to vice industrious but  nobler deeds timorous  slothful yet  pleased  ear and  persuasive accent thus began—

to mingle  involve done all  spite the great creator but their spite still serves his glory  augment the bold design pleased highly those infernal states  joy sparkled  all their eyes  full assent they vote whereat his speech  thus renews— “well have ye judged well ended long debate synod  gods and like  what ye are great things resolved which   lowest deep will once more lift us up  spite

oppose or undertake the perilous attempt but all sat mute pondering  danger  deep thoughts  each in other’s countenance read his own dismay astonished none among  choice  prime of those heavenwarring champions could  found so hardy   proffer or accept alone  dreadful voyage till  last satan whom now transcendent glory raised above his fellows  monarchal pride conscious  highest worth unmoved thus spake— “o progeny  heaven empyreal thrones with reason hath deep silence  demur seized us though undismayed long   way and hard  out  hell leads up  light our prison strong this huge convex  fire

rose the monarch  prevented all reply prudent lest  his resolution raised others among  chief might offer now certain   refused what erst they feared and so refused might  opinion stand his rivals

to  nightwarbling bird  now awake tunes sweetest his lovelaboured song now reigns fullorbed  moon   more pleasing light shadowy sets off  face  things  vain if none regard heaven wakes  all his eyes whom  behold but thee nature’s desire in whose sight all things joy  ravishment attracted  thy beauty still  gaze” i rose   thy call but found thee not to find thee i directed then my walk and on methought alone i passed through ways that brought me   sudden   tree of interdicted knowledge fair  seemed much fairer  my fancy than  day and  i wondering looked beside  stood one shaped  winged like one  those  heaven by us oft seen his dewy locks distilled ambrosia   tree  also gazed and “o fair plant” said he “with fruit surcharged deigns none  ease thy load  taste thy sweet nor god nor man is knowledge so despised or envy or what reserve forbids  taste forbid who will none shall  me withhold longer thy offered good why else set here” this said  paused not but  venturous arm he plucked  tasted me damp horrour chilled at such bold words vouched   deed so bold but  thus overjoyed “o fruit divine sweet  thyself but much more sweet thus cropt forbidden here  seems  only fit for gods yet able  make gods  men and why not gods  men since good  more communicated more abundant grows the author not impaired but honoured more here happy creature fair angelick eve partake thou also happy though thou art happier thou mayest be worthier canst not be taste this   henceforth among  gods thyself  goddess not  earth confined but sometimes   air  we sometimes ascend  heaven  merit thine  see what life  gods live there  such live thou” so saying  drew nigh   me held even  my mouth   same fruit held part which  had plucked  pleasant savoury smell so quickened appetite  i methought could not but taste forthwith up   clouds with him i flew  underneath beheld the earth outstretched immense  prospect wide and various wondering  my flight  change to this high exaltation suddenly my guide  gone  i methought sunk down and fell asleep but o how glad i waked to find this but  dream thus eve her night related  thus adam answered sad best image  myself  dearer half the trouble  thy thoughts this night  sleep affects me equally nor can i like this uncouth dream  evil sprung i fear yet evil whence  thee can harbour none created pure but know    soul are many lesser faculties  serve reason  chief among these fancy next her office holds  all external things which  five watchful senses represent she forms imaginations aery shapes which reason joining or disjoining frames all what we affirm or what deny  call our knowledge or opinion then retires into her private cell when nature rests oft  her absence mimick fancy wakes to imitate her but misjoining shapes wild work produces oft  most  dreams ill matching words  deeds long past or late some such resemblances methinks i find of our last evening’s talk  this thy dream but  addition strange yet  not sad evil into  mind  god or man may come  go so unreproved  leave no spot or blame behind which gives me hope that what  sleep thou didst abhor  dream waking thou never  consent  do be not disheartened then

green shady bank profuse  flowers pensive i sat me down there gentle sleep first found me   soft oppression seised my droused sense untroubled though i thought i then  passing  my former state

the doubt since human reach no further knows for though  lord  all  infinite is his wrath also be it man  not so but mortal doomed how can  exercise wrath without end  man whom death must end can  make deathless death that   make strange contradiction which  god himself impossible  held  argument of weakness not  power will  draw out for anger’s sake finite  infinite in punished man  satisfy

needs must  serpent now his capital bruise expect  mortal pain say where  when their fight what stroke shall bruise  victor’s heel to whom thus michael dream not  their fight as   duel or  local wounds of head or heel not therefore joins  son manhood  godhead  more strength  foil thy enemy nor so  overcome satan whose fall  heaven  deadlier bruise disabled not  give thee thy death’s wound which he who comes thy saviour shall recure not  destroying satan but his works in thee   thy seed nor can this be but  fulfilling  which thou didst want obedience   law  god imposed on penalty  death  suffering death the penalty  thy transgression due and due  theirs which out  thine  grow so only can high justice rest appaid the law  god exact  shall fulfil both  obedience   love though love alone fulfil  law thy punishment he shall endure  coming   flesh to  reproachful life  cursed death proclaiming life  all who shall believe in his redemption   his obedience imputed becomes theirs  faith his merits to save them not their own though legal works for this  shall live hated  blasphemed seised   force judged   death condemned a shameful  accursed nailed   cross by his own nation slain  bringing life but   cross  nails thy enemies the law   against thee   sins of all mankind  him there crucified never  hurt them more who rightly trust in this his satisfaction so  dies but soon revives death over him no power shall long usurp ere  third dawning light return  stars  morn shall see him rise out  his grave fresh   dawning light thy ransom paid which man  death redeems his death  man  many  offered life neglect not   benefit embrace by faith not void  works this godlike act annuls thy doom  death thou shouldest have died in sin  ever lost  life this act shall bruise  head  satan crush his strength defeating sin  death his two main arms and fix far deeper  his head their stings than temporal death shall bruise  victor’s heel or theirs whom  redeems  death like sleep a gentle wafting  immortal life nor after resurrection shall  stay longer  earth than certain times  appear to his disciples men who  his life still followed him  them shall leave  charge to teach all nations what  him they learned and his salvation them who shall believe baptizing   profluent stream  sign of washing them  guilt  sin  life pure   mind prepared if so befall for death like  which  redeemer died all nations they shall teach for   day not only   sons  abraham’s loins salvation shall  preached but   sons of abraham’s faith wherever through  world so  his seed all nations shall  blest then   heaven  heavens  shall ascend with victory triumphing through  air over his foes  thine there shall surprise the serpent prince  air  drag  chains through all his realm  there confounded leave then enter into glory  resume his seat  god’s right hand exalted high above all names  heaven  thence shall come when this world’s dissolution shall  ripe with glory  power  judge both quick  dead to judge  unfaithful dead but  reward his faithful  receive them into bliss whether  heaven or earth  then  earth shall all  paradise far happier place than this  eden  far happier days so spake  archangel michael then paused as   world’s great period  our sire replete  joy  wonder thus replied o goodness infinite goodness immense that all this good  evil shall produce and evil turn  good more wonderful than  which  creation first brought forth light out  darkness full  doubt i stand whether i should repent me now  sin by me done  occasioned or rejoice much more  much more good thereof shall spring to god more glory more goodwill  men from god  over wrath grace shall abound but say if our deliverer up  heaven must reascend what  betide  few his faithful left among  unfaithful herd the enemies  truth who then shall guide his people who defend will they not deal worse  his followers than  him they dealt be sure they will said  angel but  heaven he  his own  comforter  send the promise   father who shall dwell his spirit within them   law  faith working through love upon their hearts shall write to guide them  all truth  also arm with spiritual armour able  resist satan’s assaults  quench his fiery darts what man can do against them not afraid though   death against such cruelties with inward consolations recompensed and oft supported so  shall amaze their proudest persecutors for  spirit poured first  his apostles whom  sends to evangelize  nations then  all baptized shall them  wonderous gifts endue to speak all tongues  do all miracles as did their lord before them thus they win great numbers  each nation  receive with joy  tidings brought  heaven at length their ministry performed  race well run their doctrine  their story written left they die but  their room  they forewarn wolves shall succeed  teachers grievous wolves who all  sacred mysteries  heaven to their own vile advantages shall turn of lucre  ambition   truth with superstitions  traditions taint left only  those written records pure though not but   spirit understood then shall they seek  avail themselves  names places  titles   these  join secular power though feigning still  act by spiritual  themselves appropriating the spirit  god promised alike  given to all believers and   pretence spiritual laws  carnal power shall force on every conscience laws which none shall find left them inrolled or what  spirit within shall   heart engrave what  they then but force  spirit  grace itself  bind his consort liberty what but unbuild his living temples built  faith  stand their own faith not another’s for  earth who against faith  conscience can  heard infallible yet many  presume whence heavy persecution shall arise on all who   worship persevere of spirit  truth  rest far greater part will deem  outward rites  specious forms religion satisfied truth shall retire bestuck  slanderous darts  works  faith rarely  found so shall  world go on to good malignant  bad men benign under her own weight groaning till  day appear  respiration   just and vengeance   wicked  return of him so lately promised  thy aid the woman’s seed obscurely then foretold now ampler known thy saviour  thy lord last   clouds  heaven   revealed in glory   father  dissolve satan  his perverted world then raise from  conflagrant mass purged  refined new heavens new earth ages  endless date founded  righteousness  peace  love to bring forth fruits joy  eternal bliss he ended  thus adam last replied how soon hath thy prediction seer blest measured this transient world  race

overcoming evil   small accomplishing great things  things deemed weak subverting worldly strong  worldly wise by simply meek  suffering  truth’s sake is fortitude  highest victory and   faithful death  gate  life taught this  his example whom i now acknowledge my redeemer ever blest to whom thus also  angel last replied this having learned thou hast attained  sum of wisdom hope no higher though all  stars thou knewest  name  all  ethereal powers all secrets   deep all nature’s works or works  god  heaven air earth or sea and all  riches  this world enjoyedst and all  rule one empire
