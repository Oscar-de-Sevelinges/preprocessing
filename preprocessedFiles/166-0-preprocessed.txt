library  which no new books had been bought  twenty years  where  old ones mouldered undisturbed   damp shelves yet charity royall had always been told  she ought  consider   privilege  her lot had been cast  north dormer she knew that compared   place she had come from north dormer represented all  blessings   most refined civilization everyone   village had told her so ever since she had been brought there   child even old miss hatchard had said  her   terrible occasion  her life “my child you must never cease  remember    mr royall who brought you down   mountain” she had been “brought down   mountain”   scarred cliff  lifted  sullen wall above  lesser slopes  eagle range making  perpetual background  gloom   lonely valley the mountain   good fifteen miles away but  rose so abruptly   lower hills   seemed almost  cast  shadow over north dormer and   like  great magnet drawing  clouds  scattering them  storm across  valley if ever   purest summer sky there trailed  thread  vapour

looked up   mountain thinking  these things  tried  usual   thankful but  sight   young man turning   miss hatchards gate had brought back  vision   glittering streets  nettleton  she felt ashamed

half way down  street she stopped   weakhinged gate passing through it she walked down  brick path   queer little brick temple  white wooden columns supporting  pediment  which  inscribed  tarnished gold letters “the honorius hatchard memorial library ” honorius hatchard had been old miss hatchards greatuncle though she would undoubtedly have reversed  phrase  put forward  her only claim

since ally hawes  poorest girl   village had shown herself  church  enviable transparencies about  shoulders charitys hook had travelled faster she unrolled  lace dug  hook into  loop  bent   task  furrowed brows suddenly  door opened  before she had raised her eyes she knew   young man she had seen going    hatchard gate had entered  library without taking any notice  her  began  move slowly about  long vaultlike room his hands behind his back his shortsighted eyes peering up  down  rows  rusty bindings at length  reached  desk  stood before her “have you  cardcatalogue”  asked   pleasant abrupt voice   oddness   question caused her  drop her work “a what” “why you know” he broke off  she became conscious    looking  her   first time having apparently  his entrance included her  his general shortsighted survey  part   furniture   library the fact that  discovering her  lost  thread  his remark did not escape her attention  she looked down  smiled he smiled also “no i dont suppose you do know”  corrected himself “in fact  would  almost  pity” she thought she detected  slight condescension  his tone  asked sharply “why” “because its so much pleasanter   small library like this  poke about  ones selfwith  help   librarian” he added  last phrase so respectfully  she  mollified  rejoined   sigh “im afraid i cant help you much” “why”  questioned  his turn  she replied  there werent many books anyhow   shed hardly read any  them “the worms  getting  them” she added gloomily “are they thats  pity  i see there  some good ones” he seemed  have lost interest  their conversation  strolled away again apparently forgetting her his indifference nettled her  she picked up her work resolved not  offer him  least assistance apparently  did not need it   spent  long time  his back  her lifting down one after another  tall cobwebby volumes   distant shelf “oh i say”  exclaimed  looking up she saw   had drawn out his handkerchief   carefully wiping  edges   book  his hand the action struck her   unwarranted criticism  her care   books  she said irritably “its not my fault if theyre dirty” he turned around  looked  her  reviving interest “ahthen youre not  librarian” “of course i am but i cant dust all these books besides nobody ever looks  them now miss hatchards too lame  come round” “no i suppose not” he laid down  book  had been wiping  stood considering her  silence she wondered if miss hatchard had sent him round  pry into  way  library  looked after   suspicion increased her resentment “i saw you going into her house just now didnt i” she asked   new england avoidance   proper name she  determined  find out why   poking about among her books “miss hatchards house yesshes my cousin  im staying there”  young man answered adding  if  disarm  visible distrust “my name  harneylucius harney she may have spoken  me” “no she hasnt” said charity wishing she could have said “yes she has” “oh well” said miss hatchards cousin   laugh  after another pause during which  occurred  charity  her answer had not been encouraging  remarked “you dont seem strong  architecture” her bewilderment  complete  more she wished  appear  understand him  more unintelligible his remarks became he reminded her   gentleman who had “explained”  pictures  nettleton   weight  her ignorance settled down  her again like  pall “i mean i cant see  you have any books   old houses about here i suppose   matter this part   country hasnt been much explored they all go  doing plymouth  salem so stupid my cousins house now  remarkable this place must have had  pastit must have been more   place once” he stopped short   blush   shy man who overhears himself  fears   been voluble “im  architect you see  im hunting up old houses  these parts” she stared “old houses everythings old  north dormer isnt it the folks are anyhow” he laughed  wandered away again “havent you any kind   history   place i think there  one written about   book or pamphlet about  first settlement”  presently said   farther end   room she pressed her crochet hook against her lip  pondered there  such  work she knew “north dormer   early townships  eagle county” she had  special grudge against  because    limp weakly book   always either falling off  shelf or slipping back  disappearing if one squeezed   between sustaining volumes she remembered  last time she had picked  up wondering how anyone could have taken  trouble  write  book about north dormer   neighbours dormer hamblin creston  creston river she knew them all mere lost clusters  houses   folds   desolate ridges dormer where north dormer went   apples creston river where there used    papermill   grey walls stood decaying   stream  hamblin where  first snow always fell such  their titles  fame she got up  began  move about vaguely before  shelves but she had no idea where she had last put  book  something told her    going  play her  usual trick  remain invisible it  not one  her lucky days “i guess its somewhere” she said  prove her zeal but she spoke without conviction  felt  her words conveyed none “oh well”  said again she knew   going  wished more than ever  find  book “it    next time”  added  picking up  volume  had laid   desk  handed   her “by  way  little air  sun would do this good its rather valuable” he gave her  nod  smile  passed out ii the hours   hatchard memorial librarian   three  five  charity royalls sense  duty usually kept her  her desk until nearly halfpast four but she had never perceived  any practical advantage thereby accrued either  north dormer or  herself  she had no scruple  decreeing when  suited her   library should close  hour earlier a few minutes after mr harneys departure she formed this decision put away her lace fastened  shutters  turned  key   door   temple  knowledge the street upon which she emerged  still empty  after glancing up  down  she began  walk toward her house but instead  entering she passed on turned into  fieldpath  mounted   pasture   hillside she let down  bars   gate followed  trail along  crumbling wall   pasture  walked  till she reached  knoll where  clump  larches shook out their fresh tassels   wind there she lay down   slope tossed off her hat  hid her face   grass she  blind  insensible  many things  dimly knew it but  all   light  air perfume  colour every drop  blood  her responded she loved  roughness   dry mountain grass under her palms  smell   thyme into which she crushed her face  fingering   wind  her hair  through her cotton blouse   creak   larches  they swayed  it she often climbed up  hill  lay there alone   mere pleasure  feeling  wind   rubbing her cheeks   grass generally  such times she did not think  anything but lay immersed   inarticulate wellbeing today  sense  wellbeing  intensified  her joy  escaping   library she liked well enough  have  friend drop   talk  her when she   duty but she hated   bothered about books how could she remember where they were when they  so seldom asked for orma fry occasionally took out  novel  her brother ben  fond  what  called “jography”   books relating  trade  bookkeeping but no one else asked  anything except  intervals “uncle toms cabin” or “opening   chestnut burr” or longfellow she had these under her hand  could have found them   dark but unexpected demands came so rarely  they exasperated her like  injustice she had liked  young mans looks  his shortsighted eyes  his odd way  speaking   abrupt yet soft just  his hands  sunburnt  sinewy yet  smooth nails like  womans his hair  sunburntlooking too or rather  colour  bracken after frost his eyes grey   appealing look   shortsighted his smile shy yet confident  if  knew lots  things she had never dreamed of  yet wouldnt   world have had her feel his superiority but she did feel it  liked  feeling    new  her poor  ignorant  she was  knew herself  behumblest   humble even  north dormer where  come   mountain   worst disgraceyet  her narrow world she had always ruled it  partly  course owing   fact  lawyer royall  “the biggest man  north dormer” so much too big  it  fact  outsiders who didnt know always wondered how  held him in spite  everythingand  spite even  miss hatchardlawyer royall ruled  north dormer  charity ruled  lawyer royalls house she had never put   herself  those terms but she knew her power knew what   made of  hated it confusedly  young man   library had made her feel   first time what might   sweetness  dependence she sat up brushed  bits  grass  her hair  looked down   house where she held sway it stood just below her cheerless  untended  faded red front divided   road   “yard”   path bordered  gooseberry bushes  stone well overgrown  travellers joy   sickly crimson rambler tied   fanshaped support which mr royall had once brought up  hepburn  please her behind  house  bit  uneven ground  clotheslines strung across  stretched up   dry wall  beyond  wall  patch  corn   few rows  potatoes strayed vaguely into  adjoining wilderness  rock  fern charity could not recall her first sight   house she had been told  she  ill   fever when she  brought down   mountain  she could only remember waking one day   cot   foot  mrs royalls bed  opening her eyes   cold neatness   room   afterward   hers mrs royall died seven or eight years later    time charity had taken  measure  most things about her she knew  mrs royall  sad  timid  weak she knew  lawyer royall  harsh  violent  still weaker she knew  she had been christened charity in  white church   other end   village  commemorate mr royalls disinterestedness  “bringing her down”   keep alive  her  becoming sense  her dependence she knew  mr royall  her guardian but   had not legally adopted her though everybody spoke  her  charity royall  she knew why  had come back  live  north dormer instead  practising  nettleton where  had begun his legal career after mrs royalls death there  some talk  sending her   boardingschool miss hatchard suggested it  had  long conference  mr royall who  pursuance  her plan departed one day  starkfield  visit  institution she recommended he came back  next night   black face worse charity observed than she had ever seen him    time she had had some experience when she asked him how soon she   start  answered shortly “you aint going”  shut himself up   room  called his office   next day  lady who kept  school  starkfield wrote  “under  circumstances” she  afraid she could not make room just then  another pupil charity  disappointed but she understood it wasnt  temptations  starkfield  had been mr royalls undoing    thought  losing her he   dreadfully “lonesome” man she had made  out because she  so “lonesome” herself he  she face  face   sad house had sounded  depths  isolation  though she felt no particular affection  him  not  slightest gratitude she pitied him because she  conscious    superior   people about him   she   only being between him  solitude therefore when miss hatchard sent  her  day or two later  talk   school  nettleton   say  this time  friend  hers would “make  necessary arrangements” charity cut her short   announcement  she had decided not  leave north dormer miss hatchard reasoned  her kindly but  no purpose she simply repeated “i guess mr royalls too lonesome” miss hatchard blinked perplexedly behind her eyeglasses her long frail face  full  puzzled wrinkles  she leant forward resting her hands   arms  her mahogany armchair   evident desire  say something  ought   said “the feeling does you credit my dear” she looked about  pale walls  her sittingroom seeking counsel  ancestral daguerreotypes  didactic samplers but they seemed  make utterance more difficult “the fact is its not onlynot only because   advantages there  other reasons youre too young  understand” “oh no i aint” said charity harshly  miss hatchard blushed   roots  her blonde cap but she must have felt  vague relief  having her explanation cut short  she concluded again invoking  daguerreotypes “of course i shall always do what i can  you   case  case you know you can always come  me” lawyer royall  waiting  charity   porch when she returned  this visit he had shaved  brushed his black coat  looked  magnificent monument   man  such moments she really admired him “well”  said “is  settled” “yes its settled i aint going” “not   nettleton school” “not anywhere” he cleared his throat  asked sternly “why” “id rather not” she said swinging past him  her way  her room it   following week   brought her up  crimson rambler   fan  hepburn he had never given her anything before the next outstanding incident  her life had happened two years later when she  seventeen lawyer royall who hated  go  nettleton had been called there  connection   case he still exercised his profession though litigation languished  north dormer   outlying hamlets   once  had had  opportunity   could not afford  refuse he spent three days  nettleton won his case  came back  high goodhumour it   rare mood  him  manifested itself  this occasion  his talking impressively   suppertable   “rousing welcome” his old friends had given him he wound up confidentially “i   damn fool ever  leave nettleton it  mrs royall  made me do it” charity immediately perceived  something bitter had happened  him     trying  talk down  recollection she went up  bed early leaving him seated  moody thought his elbows propped   worn oilcloth   supper table on  way up she had extracted  his overcoat pocket  key   cupboard where  bottle  whiskey  kept she  awakened   rattling  her door  jumped out  bed she heard mr royalls voice low  peremptory  opened  door fearing  accident no other thought had occurred  her but when she saw him   doorway  ray   autumn moon falling  his discomposed face she understood for  moment they looked  each other  silence then   put his foot across  threshold she stretched out her arm  stopped him “you go right back  here” she said   shrill voice  startled her “you aint going  have  key tonight” “charity let me in i dont want  key im  lonesome man”  began   deep voice  sometimes moved her her heart gave  startled plunge but she continued  hold him back contemptuously “well i guess you made  mistake then this aint your wifes room any longer” she  not frightened she simply felt  deep disgust  perhaps  divined  or read   her face  after staring  her  moment  drew back  turned slowly away   door with her ear  her keyhole she heard him feel his way down  dark stairs  toward  kitchen  she listened   crash   cupboard panel but instead she heard him after  interval unlock  door   house  his heavy steps came  her through  silence   walked down  path she crept   window  saw his bent figure striding up  road   moonlight then  belated sense  fear came  her   consciousness  victory  she slipped into bed cold   bone a day or two later poor eudora skeff who  twenty years had been  custodian   hatchard library died suddenly  pneumonia   day after  funeral charity went  see miss hatchard  asked   appointed librarian the request seemed  surprise miss hatchard she evidently questioned  new candidates qualifications “why i dont know my dear arent you rather too young” she hesitated “i want  earn some money” charity merely answered “doesnt mr royall give you all you require no one  rich  north dormer” “i want  earn money enough  get away” “to get away” miss hatchards puzzled wrinkles deepened  there   distressful pause “you want  leave mr royall” “yes or i want another woman   house  me” said charity resolutely miss hatchard clasped her nervous hands about  arms  her chair her eyes invoked  faded countenances   wall  after  faint cough  indecision she brought out “the  houseworks too hard  you i suppose” charitys heart grew cold she understood  miss hatchard had no help  give her   she would have  fight her way out  her difficulty alone a deeper sense  isolation overcame her she felt incalculably old “shes got   talked  like  baby” she thought   feeling  compassion  miss hatchards long immaturity “yes thats it” she said aloud “the houseworks too hard  me ive been coughing  good deal this fall” she noted  immediate effect  this suggestion miss hatchard paled   memory  poor eudoras takingoff  promised  do what she could but  course there  people she must consult  clergyman  selectmen  north dormer   distant hatchard relative  springfield “if youd only gone  school” she sighed she followed charity   door  there   security   threshold said   glance  evasive appeal “i know mr royall is trying  times but his wife bore  him  you must always remember charity    mr royall who brought you down   mountain” charity went home  opened  door  mr royalls “office” he  sitting there   stove reading daniel websters speeches they had met  meals during  five days  had elapsed since  had come  her door  she had walked  his side  eudoras funeral but they had not spoken  word  each other he glanced up  surprise  she entered  she noticed    unshaved    looked unusually old but  she had always thought  him   old man  change  his appearance did not move her she told him she had been  see miss hatchard   what object she saw    astonished but  made no comment “i told her  housework  too hard  me  i wanted  earn  money  pay   hired girl but i aint going  pay  her youve got to i want  have some money  my own” mr royalls bushy black eyebrows  drawn together   frown   sat drumming  inkstained nails   edge  his desk “what do you want  earn money for”  asked “sos  get away when i want to” “why do you want  get away” her contempt flashed out “do you suppose anybodyd stay  north dormer if they could help it you wouldnt folks say” with lowered head  asked “whered you go to” “anywhere where i can earn my living ill try here first  if i cant do  here ill go somewhere else ill go up  mountain if i have to” she paused  this threat  saw   had taken effect “i want you should get miss hatchard   selectmen  take me   library  i want  woman here   house  me” she repeated mr royall had grown exceedingly pale when she ended  stood up ponderously leaning against  desk    second or two they looked  each other “see here”  said  length  though utterance  difficult “theres something ive been wanting  say  you id ought  have said  before i want you  marry me” the girl still stared  him without moving “i want you  marry me”  repeated clearing his throat “the ministerll  up here next sunday  we can fix  up then or ill drive you down  hepburn   justice  get  done there ill do whatever you say” his eyes fell under  merciless stare she continued  fix  him   shifted his weight uneasily  one foot   other as  stood there before her unwieldy shabby disordered  purple veins distorting  hands  pressed against  desk  his long orators jaw trembling   effort  his avowal  seemed like  hideous parody   fatherly old man she had always known “marry you me” she burst out   scornful laugh “was  what you came  ask me  other night whats come over you i wonder how long   since youve looked  yourself   glass” she straightened herself insolently conscious  her youth  strength “i suppose you think  would  cheaper  marry me than  keep  hired girl everybody knows youre  closest man  eagle county but i guess youre not going  get your mending done  you  way twice” mr royall did not move while she spoke his face  ashcoloured  his black eyebrows quivered  though  blaze  her scorn had blinded him when she ceased  held up his hand “thatll dothatll about do”  said he turned   door  took his hat   hatpeg on  threshold  paused “people aint been fair  mefrom  first they aint been fair  me”  said then  went out a few days later north dormer learned  surprise  charity had been appointed librarian

his sudden pause when  had come close   desk  had his first look  her the sight had made him forget what   going  say she recalled  change  his face  jumping up she ran over  bare boards  her washstand found  matches lit  candle  lifted    square  lookingglass   whitewashed wall her small face usually so darkly pale glowed like  rose   faint orb  light  under her rumpled hair her eyes

like  know” “round about four oclock” charity  silent she had been so steeped   dreamy remembrance  young harneys visit  she had forgotten having deserted her post  soon   had left  library “who came  four oclock” “miss hatchard did” “miss hatchard why she aint ever been near  place since shes been lame she couldnt get up  steps if she tried” “she can  helped up i guess she  yesterday anyhow   young fellow thats staying  her he found you there i understand earlier   afternoon   went back  told miss hatchard  books   bad shape  needed attending to she got excited  had herself wheeled straight round  when she got there  place  locked so she sent  me  told me about that  about  other complaints she claims youve neglected things   shes going  get  trained librarian” charity had not moved while  spoke she stood  her head thrown back against  windowframe her arms hanging against her sides  her hands so tightly clenched  she felt without knowing what hurt her  sharp edge  her nails against her palms of all mr royall had said she had retained only  phrase “he told miss hatchard  books   bad shape” what did she care   other charges against her malice or truth she despised them  she despised her detractors but   stranger  whom she had felt herself so mysteriously drawn should have betrayed her that   very moment when she had fled up  hillside  think  him more deliciously  should have been hastening home  denounce her shortcomings she remembered how   darkness  her room she had covered her face  press his imagined kiss closer  her heart raged against him   liberty  had not taken “well ill go” she said suddenly “ill go right off” “go where” she heard  startled note  mr royalls voice “why out  their old library straight out  never set foot   again they neednt think im going  wait round  let them say theyve discharged me” “charitycharity royall you listen”  began getting heavily out  his chair but she waved him aside  walked out   room upstairs she took  library key   place where she always hid  under her pincushionwho said she wasnt carefulput  her hat  swept down again  out into  street if mr royall heard her go  made no motion  detain her his sudden rages probably made him understand  uselessness  reasoning  hers she reached  brick temple unlocked  door  entered into  glacial twilight “im glad ill never have  sit  this old vault again when other folks  out   sun” she said aloud   familiar chill took her she looked  abhorrence   long dingy rows  books  sheepnosed minerva  her black pedestal   mildfaced young man   high stock whose effigy pined above her desk she meant  take out   drawer her roll  lace   library register  go straight  miss hatchard  announce her resignation but suddenly  great desolation overcame her  she sat down  laid her face against  desk her heart  ravaged  lifes cruelest discovery  first creature who had come toward her out   wilderness had brought her anguish instead  joy she did not cry tears came hard  her   storms  her heart spent themselves inwardly but  she sat there  her dumb woe she felt her life   too desolate too ugly  intolerable “what have i ever done  it   should hurt me so” she groaned  pressed her fists against her lids which  beginning  swell  weeping “i wonti wont go there looking like  horror” she muttered springing up  pushing back her hair  if  stifled her she opened  drawer dragged out  register  turned toward  door as she did so  opened   young man  miss hatchards came  whistling iv he stopped  lifted his hat   shy smile “i beg your pardon”  said “i thought there  no one here” charity stood before him barring his way “you cant come in the library aint open   public wednesdays” “i know its not but my cousin gave me her key” “miss hatchards got no right  give her key  other folks any moren i have im  librarian  i know  bylaws this  my library” the young man looked profoundly surprised “why i know  is im so sorry if you mind my coming” “i suppose you came  see what more you could say  set her against me but you neednt trouble its my library today but  wont  this time tomorrow im   way now  take her back  key   register” young harneys face grew grave but without betraying  consciousness  guilt she had looked for “i dont understand”  said “there must  some mistake why should i say things against you  miss hatchardor  anyone” the apparent evasiveness   reply caused charitys indignation  overflow “i dont know why you should i could understand orma frys doing it because shes always wanted  get me out  here ever since  first day i cant see why when shes got her own home  her father  work  her nor ida targatt neither when she got  legacy  her stepbrother ony last year but anyway we all live   same place  when its  place like north dormer its enough  make people hate each other just  have  walk down  same street every day but you dont live here  you dont know anything about any  us so what did you have  meddle for do you suppose  other girlsd have kept  books any bettern i did why orma fry dont hardly know  book   flatiron and what if i dont always sit round here doing nothing till  strikes five up   church who cares if  librarys open or shut do you suppose anybody ever comes here  books what theyd like  come    meet  fellows theyre going  if id let em but i wouldnt let bill sollas  over  hill hang round here waiting   youngest targatt girl because i know him thats all even if i dont know about books all i ought to” she stopped   choking  her throat tremors  rage  running through her  she steadied herself against  edge   desk lest  should see her weakness what  saw seemed  affect him deeply   grew red under his sunburn  stammered out “but miss royall i assure you i assure you” his distress inflamed her anger  she regained her voice  fling back “if i  you id have  nerve  stick  what i said” the taunt seemed  restore his presence  mind “i hope i should if i knew but i dont apparently something disagreeable  happened  which you think im  blame but i dont know what  is because ive been up  eagle ridge ever since  early morning” “i dont know where youve been this morning but i know you  here  this library yesterday    you  went home  told your cousin  books   bad shape  brought her round  see how id neglected them” young harney looked sincerely concerned “was  what you  told i dont wonder youre angry the books   bad shape   some  interesting its  pity i told miss hatchard they  suffering  dampness  lack  air  i brought her here  show her how easily  place could  ventilated i also told her you ought  have some one  help you do  dusting  airing if you  given  wrong version  what i said im sorry but im so fond  old books  id rather see them made into  bonfire than left  moulder away like these” charity felt her sobs rising  tried  stifle them  words “i dont care what you say you told her all i know  she thinks its all my fault  im going  lose my job  i wanted  moren anyone   village because i havent got anybody belonging  me  way other folks have all i wanted   put aside money enough  get away  here sometime dyou suppose if  hadnt been   id have kept  sitting day after day  this old vault” of this appeal her hearer took up only  last question “it   old vault but need  be thats  point and its my putting  question  my cousin  seems  have been  cause   trouble” his glance explored  melancholy penumbra   long narrow room resting   blotched walls  discoloured rows  books   stern rosewood desk surmounted   portrait   young honorius “of course its  bad job  do anything   building jammed against  hill like this ridiculous mausoleum you couldnt get  good draught through  without blowing  hole   mountain but  can  ventilated after  fashion   sun can  let in ill show you how if you like” the architects passion  improvement had already made him lose sight  her grievance   lifted his stick instructively toward  cornice but her silence seemed  tell him  she took no interest   ventilation   library  turning back  her abruptly  held out both hands “look hereyou dont mean what you said you dont really think id do anything  hurt you” a new note  his voice disarmed her no one had ever spoken  her   tone “oh what did you do   then” she wailed he had her hands  his  she  feeling  smooth touch  she had imagined  day before   hillside he pressed her hands lightly  let them go “why  make things pleasanter  you here  better   books im sorry if my cousin twisted around what i said shes excitable  she lives  trifles i ought  have remembered that dont punish me  letting her think you take her seriously” it  wonderful  hear him speak  miss hatchard  if she   querulous baby  spite  his shyness  had  air  power   experience  cities probably gave it   fact  having lived  nettleton  made lawyer royall  spite  his infirmities  strongest man  north dormer  charity  sure  this young man had lived  bigger places than nettleton she felt  if she kept up her denunciatory tone  would secretly class her  miss hatchard   thought made her suddenly simple “it dont matter  miss hatchard how i take her mr royall says shes going  get  trained librarian  id sooner resign than have  village say she sent me away” “naturally you would but im sure she doesnt mean  send you away at any rate wont you give me  chance  find out first  let you know it   time enough  resign if im mistaken” her pride flamed into her cheeks   suggestion  his intervening “i dont want anybody should coax her  keep me if i dont suit” he coloured too “i give you my word i wont do that only wait till tomorrow  you” he looked straight into her eyes  his shy grey glance “you can trust me you knowyou really can” all  old frozen woes seemed  melt  her  she murmured awkwardly looking away  him “oh ill wait” v there had never been such  june  eagle county usually    month  moods  abrupt alternations  belated frost  midsummer heat this year day followed day   sequence  temperate beauty every morning  breeze blew steadily   hills toward noon  built up great canopies  white cloud  threw  cool shadow over fields  woods then before sunset  clouds dissolved again   western light rained  unobstructed

sunwarmed animal charity had lain there  long time passive  sunwarmed   slope  which she lay when there came between her eyes   dancing butterfly  sight   mans foot   large worn boot covered  red mud “oh dont” she exclaimed raising herself  her elbow  stretching out  warning hand “dont what”  hoarse voice asked above her head “dont stamp  those bramble flowers you dolt” she retorted springing  her knees the foot paused  then descended clumsily   frail branch  raising her eyes she saw above her  bewildered face   slouching man   thin sunburnt beard  white arms showing through his ragged shirt “dont you ever see anything liff hyatt” she assailed him   stood before her   look   man who  stirred up  wasps nest he grinned “i seen you thats what i come down for” “down  where” she questioned stooping  gather up  petals his foot had scattered he jerked his thumb toward  heights “been cutting down trees  dan targatt” charity sank back  her heels  looked  him musingly she  not   least afraid  poor liff hyatt though  “came   mountain”  some   girls ran when they saw him among  more reasonable  passed   harmless creature  sort  link between  mountain  civilized folk who occasionally came down  did  little wood cutting   farmer when hands  short besides she knew  mountain people would never hurt her liff himself had told her so once when she   little girl  had met him one day   edge  lawyer royalls pasture “they wont any  em touch you up there fever you   come up but i dont spose you will”  had added philosophically looking  her new shoes    red ribbon  mrs royall had tied  her hair charity had  truth never felt any desire  visit her birthplace she did not care  have  known  she    mountain   shy  being seen  talk  liff hyatt but today she  not sorry  have him appear a great many things had happened  her since  day when young lucius harney had entered  doors   hatchard memorial but none perhaps so unforeseen   fact  her suddenly finding   convenience    good terms  liff hyatt she continued  look up curiously  his freckled weatherbeaten face  feverish hollows below  cheekbones   pale yellow eyes   harmless animal “i wonder if hes related  me” she thought   shiver  disdain “is there any folks living   brown house   swamp up under porcupine” she presently asked   indifferent tone liff hyatt   while considered her  surprise then  scratched his head  shifted his weight  one tattered sole   other “theres always  same folks   brown house”  said  his vague grin “theyre  up your way aint they” “their names  same  mine”  rejoined uncertainly charity still held him  resolute eyes “see here i want  go there some day  take  gentleman  me thats boarding  us hes up  these parts drawing pictures” she did not offer  explain this statement it  too far beyond liff hyatts limitations   attempt   worth making “he wants  see  brown house  go all over it” she pursued liff  still running his fingers perplexedly through his shock  strawcolored hair “is   fellow   city”  asked “yes he draws pictures  things hes down there now drawing  bonner house” she pointed   chimney just visible over  dip   pasture below  wood “the bonner house” liff echoed incredulously “yes you wont understandand  dont matter all i say is hes going   hyatts   day or two” liff looked more  more perplexed “bash  ugly sometimes   afternoons” she threw her head back her eyes full  hyatts “im coming too you tell him” “they wont none  them trouble you  hyatts wont what dyou want  take  stranger  you though” “ive told you havent i youve got  tell bash hyatt” he looked away   blue mountains   horizon then his gaze dropped   chimneytop below  pasture “hes down there now” “yes” he shifted his weight again crossed his arms  continued  survey  distant landscape “well so long”  said  last inconclusively  turning away  shambled up  hillside from  ledge above her  paused  call down “i wouldnt go there  sunday” then  clambered  till  trees closed   him presently  high overhead charity heard  ring  his axe she lay   warm ridge thinking  many things   woodsmans appearance had stirred up  her she knew nothing  her early life  had never felt any curiosity about it only  sullen reluctance  explore  corner  her memory where certain blurred images lingered but all  had happened  her within  last few weeks had stirred her   sleeping depths she had become absorbingly interesting  herself  everything  had  do  her past  illuminated  this sudden curiosity she hated more than ever  fact  coming   mountain but   no longer indifferent  her everything   any way affected her  alive  vivid even  hateful things had grown interesting because they   part  herself “i wonder if liff hyatt knows who my mother was” she mused   filled her   tremor  surprise  think  some woman who  once young  slight  quick motions   blood like hers had carried her  her breast  watched her sleeping she had always thought  her mother  so long dead    no more than  nameless pinch  earth but now  occurred  her   onceyoung woman might  alive  wrinkled  elflocked like  woman she had sometimes seen   door   brown house  lucius harney wanted  draw the thought brought him back   central point  her mind  she strayed away   conjectures roused  liff hyatts presence speculations concerning  past could not hold her long when  present  so rich  future so rosy  when lucius harney  stones throw away  bending over his sketchbook frowning calculating measuring  then throwing his head back   sudden smile  had shed  brightness over everything she scrambled  her feet but  she did so she saw him coming up  pasture  dropped down   grass  wait when   drawing  measuring one  “his houses”  she called them she often strayed away  herself into  woods or up  hillside it  partly  shyness  she did so   sense  inadequacy  came  her most painfully when her companion absorbed  his job forgot her ignorance  her inability  follow his least allusion  plunged into  monologue  art  life to avoid  awkwardness  listening   blank face  also  escape  surprised stare   inhabitants   houses before which  would abruptly pull up their horse  open his sketchbook she slipped away  some spot  which without being seen she could watch him  work or  least look down   house   drawing she had not been displeased  first  have  known  north dormer   neighborhood  she  driving miss hatchards cousin about  country   buggy  had hired  lawyer royall she had always kept  herself contemptuously aloof  village lovemaking without exactly knowing whether her fierce pride  due   sense  her tainted origin or whether she  reserving herself   more brilliant fate sometimes she envied  other girls their sentimental preoccupations their long hours  inarticulate philandering  one   few youths who still lingered   village but when she pictured herself curling her hair or putting  new ribbon  her hat  ben fry or one   sollas boys  fever dropped  she relapsed into indifference now she knew  meaning  her disdains  reluctances she had learned what she  worth when lucius harney looking  her   first time had lost  thread  his speech  leaned reddening   edge  her desk but another kind  shyness had been born  her  terror  exposing  vulgar perils  sacred treasure  her happiness she  not sorry  have  neighbors suspect her  “going with”  young man   city but she did not want  known  all  countryside how many hours   long june days she spent  him what she most feared    inevitable comments should reach mr royall charity  instinctively aware  few things concerning her escaped  eyes   silent man under whose roof she lived   spite   latitude which north dormer accorded  courting couples she had always felt that   day when she showed too open  preference mr royall might  she phrased it make her “pay  it” how she did not know  her fear   greater because   undefinable if she had been accepting  attentions  one   village youths she would have been less apprehensive mr royall could not prevent her marrying when she chose to but everybody knew  “going   city fellow”   different  less straightforward affair almost every village could show  victim   perilous venture and her dread  mr royalls intervention gave  sharpened joy   hours she spent  young harney  made her   same time shy  being too generally seen  him as  approached she rose  her knees stretching her arms above her head   indolent gesture   her way  expressing  profound wellbeing “im going  take you   house up under porcupine” she announced “what house oh yes  ramshackle place near  swamp   gipsylooking people hanging about its curious   house  traces  real architecture should have been built  such  place but  people   sulkylooking lotdo you suppose theyll let us in” “theyll do whatever i tell them” she said  assurance he threw himself down beside her “will they”  rejoined   smile “well i should like  see whats left inside  house and i should like  have  talk   people who   who  telling me  other day  they had come down   mountain” charity shot  sideward look  him it   first time  had spoken   mountain except   feature   landscape what else did  know about it  about her relation  it her heart began  beat   fierce impulse  resistance which she instinctively opposed  every imagined slight “the mountain i aint afraid   mountain” her tone  defiance seemed  escape him he lay breastdown   grass breaking off sprigs  thyme  pressing them against his lips far off above  folds   nearer hills  mountain thrust itself up menacingly against  yellow sunset “i must go up there some day i want  see it”  continued her heartbeats slackened  she turned again  examine his profile it  innocent  all unfriendly intention “whatd you want  go up  mountain for” “why  must  rather  curious place theres  queer colony up there you know sort  outlaws  little independent kingdom of course youve heard them spoken of but im told they have nothing  do   people   valleysrather look down  them  fact i suppose theyre rough customers but they must have  good deal  character” she did not quite know what  meant  having  good deal  character but his tone  expressive  admiration  deepened her dawning curiosity it struck her now  strange  she knew so little about  mountain she had never asked  no one had ever offered  enlighten her north dormer took  mountain  granted  implied  disparagement   intonation rather than  explicit criticism “its queer you know”  continued “that just over there  top   hill there should   handful  people who dont give  damn  anybody” the words thrilled her they seemed  clue  her own revolts  defiances  she longed  have him tell her more “i dont know much about them have they always been there” “nobody seems  know exactly how long down  creston they told me   first colonists  supposed  have been men who worked   railway   built forty or fifty years ago between springfield  nettleton some  them took  drink or got into trouble   police  went offdisappeared into  woods a year or two later there   report  they  living up   mountain then i suppose others joined themand children  born now they say there  over  hundred people up there they seem   quite outside  jurisdiction   valleys no school no churchand no sheriff ever goes up  see what theyre about but dont people ever talk  them  north dormer” “i dont know they say theyre bad” he laughed “do they well go  see shall we” she flushed   suggestion  turned her face  his “you never heard i supposei come  there they brought me down when i  little” “you” he raised himself  his elbow looking  her  sudden interest “youre   mountain how curious i suppose thats why youre so different” her happy blood bathed her   forehead he  praising herand praising her because she came   mountain “am i different” she triumphed  affected wonder “oh awfully” he picked up her hand  laid  kiss   sunburnt knuckles “come”  said “lets  off” he stood up  shook  grass  his loose grey clothes “what  good day where  you going  take me tomorrow” vi that evening after supper charity sat alone   kitchen  listened  mr royall  young harney talking   porch she had remained indoors after  table had been cleared  old verena had hobbled up  bed the kitchen window  open  charity seated herself near it her idle hands  her knee the evening  cool  still beyond  black hills  amber west passed into pale green  then   deep blue  which  great star hung the soft hoot   little owl came through  dusk  between  calls  mens voices rose  fell mr royalls  full   sonorous satisfaction it   long time since  had had anyone  lucius harneys quality  talk to charity divined   young man symbolized all his ruined  unforgotten past when miss hatchard had been called  springfield   illness   widowed sister  young harney   time seriously embarked  his task  drawing  measuring all  old houses between nettleton   new hampshire border had suggested  possibility  boarding   red house  his cousins absence charity had trembled lest mr royall should refuse there had been no question  lodging  young man there  no room  him but  appeared   could still live  miss hatchards if mr royall would let him take his meals   red house  after  days deliberation mr royall consented charity suspected him  being glad   chance  make  little money he had  reputation  being  avaricious man but she  beginning  think   probably poorer than people knew his practice had become little more than  vague legend revived only  lengthening intervals   summons  hepburn or nettleton   appeared  depend  his living mainly   scant produce  his farm    commissions received   few insurance agencies   represented   neighbourhood at any rate  had been prompt  accepting harneys offer  hire  buggy   dollar   half  day  his satisfaction   bargain had manifested itself unexpectedly enough   end   first week  his tossing  tendollar bill into charitys lap  she sat one day retrimming her old hat “herego get yourself  sunday bonnet thatll make all  other girls mad”  said looking  her   sheepish twinkle  his deepset eyes  she immediately guessed   unwonted presentthe only gift  money she had ever received  himrepresented harneys first payment but  young mans coming had brought mr royall other than pecuniary benefit it gave him   first time  years  mans companionship charity had only  dim understanding  her guardians needs but she knew  felt himself above  people among whom  lived  she saw  lucius harney thought him so she  surprised  find how well  seemed  talk now   had  listener who understood him  she  equally struck  young harneys friendly deference their conversation  mostly about politics  beyond her range but tonight  had  peculiar interest  her  they had begun  speak   mountain she drew back  little lest they should see she   hearing “the mountain the mountain” she heard mr royall say “why  mountains  blotthats what  is sir  blot that scum up there ought  have been run  long agoand would have if  people down here hadnt been clean scared  them the mountain belongs  this township  its north dormers fault if theres  gang  thieves  outlaws living over there  sight  us defying  laws  their country why there aint  sheriff or  taxcollector or  coronerd durst go up there when they hear  trouble   mountain  selectmen look  other way  pass  appropriation  beautify  town pump the only man  ever goes up   minister   goes because they send down  get him whenever theres any  them dies they think  lot  christian burial   mountainbut i never heard  their having  minister up  marry them and they never trouble  justice   peace either they just herd together like  heathen” he went on explaining  somewhat technical language how  little colony  squatters had contrived  keep  law  bay  charity  burning eagerness awaited young harneys comment but  young man seemed more concerned  hear mr royalls views than  express his own “i suppose youve never been up there yourself”  presently asked “yes i have” said mr royall   contemptuous laugh “the wiseacres down here told me id  done  before i got back but nobody lifted  finger  hurt me and id just had one  their gang sent up  seven years too” “you went up after that” “yes sir right after it the fellow came down  nettleton  ran amuck  way they sometimes do after theyve done  woodcutting job they come down  blow  money in  this man ended up  manslaughter i got him convicted though they  scared   mountain even  nettleton  then  queer thing happened the fellow sent  me  go  see him  gaol i went  this  what  says the fool  defended me   chickenlivered son  aand all  rest  it  says ive got  job   done  me up   mountain  youre  only man i seen  court  looks  if hed do it he told me  had  child up thereor thought  hada little girl   wanted her brought down  reared like  christian i  sorry   fellow so i went up  got  child” he paused  charity listened   throbbing heart “thats  only time i ever went up  mountain”  concluded there   moments silence then harney spoke “and  childhad she no mother” “oh yes there   mother but she  glad enough  have her go shed have given her  anybody they aint half human up there i guess  mothers dead  now   life she  leading anyhow ive never heard  her   day  this” “my god how ghastly” harney murmured  charity choking  humiliation sprang  her feet  ran upstairs she knew  last knew  she   child   drunken convict    mother who wasnt “half human”   glad  have her go  she had heard this history  her origin related   one being  whose eyes she longed  appear superior   people about her she had noticed  mr royall had not named her had even avoided any allusion  might identify her   child  had brought down   mountain  she knew   out  regard  her   had kept silent but  what use  his discretion since only  afternoon misled  harneys interest   outlaw colony she had boasted  him  coming   mountain now every word  had been spoken showed her how such  origin must widen  distance between them during his ten days sojourn  north dormer lucius harney had not spoken  word  love  her he had intervened  her behalf  his cousin  had convinced miss hatchard  her merits   librarian but    simple act  justice since    his own fault  those merits had been questioned he had asked her  drive him about  country when  hired lawyer royalls buggy  go  his sketching expeditions but  too  natural enough since   unfamiliar   region lastly when his cousin  called  springfield  had begged mr royall  receive him   boarder but where else  north dormer could  have boarded not  carrick fry whose wife  paralysed  whose large family crowded his table  overflowing not   targatts who lived  mile up  road nor  poor old mrs hawes who since her eldest daughter had deserted her barely had  strength  cook her own meals while ally picked up her living   seamstress mr royalls   only house where  young man could have been offered  decent hospitality there had been nothing therefore   outward course  events  raise  charitys breast  hopes  which  trembled but beneath  visible incidents resulting  lucius harneys arrival there ran  undercurrent  mysterious  potent   influence  makes  forest break into leaf before  ice  off  pools the business  which harney had come  authentic charity had seen  letter   new york publisher commissioning him  make  study   eighteenth century houses   less familiar districts  new england but incomprehensible   whole affair   her  hard  she found   understand why  paused enchanted before certain neglected  paintless houses while others refurbished  “improved”   local builder did not arrest  glance she could not but suspect  eagle county  less rich  architecture than  averred    duration  his stay which  had fixed   month  not unconnected   look  his eyes when  had first paused before her   library everything  had followed seemed  have grown out   look his way  speaking  her his quickness  catching her meaning his evident eagerness  prolong their excursions   seize  every chance  being  her the signs  his liking  manifest enough but   hard  guess how much they meant because his manner  so different  anything north dormer had ever shown her he   once simpler  more deferential than any one she had known  sometimes   just when   simplest  she most felt  distance between them education  opportunity had divided them   width  no effort  hers could bridge  even when his youth  his admiration brought him nearest some chance word some unconscious allusion seemed  thrust her back across  gulf never had  yawned so wide  when she fled up  her room carrying  her  echo  mr royalls tale her first confused thought   prayer  she might never see young harney again it  too bitter  picture him   detached impartial listener  such  story “i wish hed go away i wish hed go tomorrow  never come back” she moaned  her pillow  far into  night she lay there   disordered dress she had forgotten  take off her whole soul  tossing misery  which her hopes  dreams spun about like drowning straws of all this tumult only  vague heartsoreness  left when she opened her eyes  next morning her first thought    weather  harney had asked her  take him   brown house under porcupine  then around  hamblin    trip   long one they   start  nine the sun rose without  cloud  earlier than usual she    kitchen making cheese sandwiches decanting buttermilk into  bottle wrapping up slices  apple pie  accusing verena  having given away  basket she needed which had always hung   hook   passage when she came out into  porch  her pink calico which had run  little   washing but  still bright enough  set off her dark tints she had such  triumphant sense  being  part   sunlight   morning   last trace  her misery vanished what did  matter where she came from or whose child she was when love  dancing  her veins  down  road she saw young harney coming toward her mr royall    porch too he had said nothing  breakfast but when she came out  her pink dress  basket  her hand  looked  her  surprise “where you going to”  asked “whymr harneys starting earlier than usual today” she answered “mr harney mr harney aint mr harney learned how  drive  horse yet” she made no answer   sat tilted back  his chair drumming   rail   porch it   first time  had ever spoken   young man   tone  charity felt  faint chill  apprehension after  moment  stood up  walked away toward  bit  ground behind  house where  hired man  hoeing the air  cool  clear   autumnal sparkle   north wind brings   hills  early summer   night had been so still   dew hung  everything not   lingering moisture but  separate beads  glittered like diamonds   ferns  grasses it   long drive   foot  porcupine first across  valley  blue hills bounding  open slopes then down into  beechwoods following  course   creston  brown brook leaping over velvet ledges then out again onto  farmlands about creston lake  gradually up  ridges   eagle range at last they reached  yoke   hills  before them opened another valley green  wild  beyond  more blue heights eddying away   sky like  waves   receding tide harney tied  horse   treestump  they unpacked their basket under  aged walnut   riven trunk out  which bumblebees darted the sun had grown hot  behind them   noonday murmur   forest summer insects danced   air   flock  white butterflies fanned  mobile tips   crimson fireweed in  valley below not  house  visible  seemed  if charity royall  young harney   only living beings   great hollow  earth  sky charitys spirits flagged  disquieting thoughts stole back  her young harney had grown silent    lay beside her his arms under his head his eyes   network  leaves above him she wondered if   musing  what mr royall had told him  if  had really debased her  his thoughts she wished  had not asked her  take him  day   brown house she did not want him  see  people she came  while  story  her birth  fresh  his mind more than once she had been   point  suggesting  they should follow  ridge  drive straight  hamblin where there   little deserted house  wanted  see but shyness  pride held her back “hed better know what kind  folks i belong to” she said  herself   somewhat forced defiance   reality   shame  kept her silent suddenly she lifted her hand  pointed   sky “theres  storm coming up” he followed her glance  smiled “is   scrap  cloud among  pines  frightens you” “its over  mountain   cloud over  mountain always means trouble” “oh i dont believe half  bad things you all say   mountain but anyhow well get down   brown house before  rain comes” he  not far wrong  only  few isolated drops had fallen when they turned into  road under  shaggy flank  porcupine  came upon  brown house it stood alone beside  swamp bordered  alder thickets  tall bulrushes not another dwelling   sight    hard  guess what motive could have actuated  early settler who had made his home  so unfriendly  spot charity had picked up enough  her companions erudition  understand what had attracted him   house she noticed  fanshaped tracery   broken light above  door  flutings   paintless pilasters   corners   round window set   gable  she knew that  reasons  still escaped her these  things   admired  recorded still they had seen other houses far more “typical” the word  harneys    threw  reins   horses neck  said   slight shiver  repugnance “we wont stay long” against  restless alders turning their white lining   storm  house looked singularly desolate the paint  almost gone   clapboards  windowpanes  broken  patched  rags   garden   poisonous tangle  nettles burdocks  tall swampweeds over which big bluebottles hummed at  sound  wheels  child   towhead  pale eyes like liff hyatts peered over  fence  then slipped away behind  outhouse harney jumped down  helped charity out    did so  rain broke  them it came slantwise   furious gale laying shrubs  young trees flat tearing off their leaves like  autumn storm turning  road into  river  making hissing pools  every hollow thunder rolled incessantly through  roar   rain   strange glitter  light ran along  ground under  increasing blackness “lucky were here after all” harney laughed he fastened  horse under  halfroofless shed  wrapping charity  his coat ran  her   house the boy had not reappeared   there  no response  their knocks harney turned  doorhandle  they went in there  three people   kitchen  which  door admitted them an old woman   handkerchief over her head  sitting   window she held  sicklylooking kitten  her knees  whenever  jumped down  tried  limp away she stooped  lifted  back without any change  her aged unnoticing face another woman  unkempt creature  charity had once noticed  driving by stood leaning against  windowframe  stared  them  near  stove  unshaved man   tattered shirt sat   barrel asleep the place  bare  miserable   air heavy   smell  dirt  stale tobacco charitys heart sank old derided tales   mountain people came back  her   womans stare  so disconcerting   face   sleeping man so sodden  bestial  her disgust  tinged   vague dread she  not afraid  herself she knew  hyatts would not  likely  trouble her but she  not sure how they would treat  “city fellow” lucius harney would certainly have laughed  her fears he glanced about  room uttered  general “how  you”  which no one responded  then asked  younger woman if they might take shelter till  storm  over she turned her eyes away  him  looked  charity “youre  girl  royalls aint you” the colour rose  charitys face “im charity royall” she said  if asserting her right   name   very place where  might have been most open  question the woman did not seem  notice “you kin stay” she merely said then she turned away  stooped over  dish  which she  stirring something harney  charity sat down   bench made   board resting  two starch boxes they faced  door hanging   broken hinge  through  crack they saw  eyes   towheaded boy    pale little girl   scar across her cheek charity smiled  signed   children  come in but  soon  they saw they  discovered they slipped away  bare feet it occurred  her  they  afraid  rousing  sleeping man  probably  woman shared their fear  she moved about  noiselessly  avoided going near  stove the rain continued  beat against  house   one or two places  sent  stream through  patched panes  ran into pools   floor every now  then  kitten mewed  struggled down   old woman stooped  caught it holding  tight  her bony hands  once or twice  man   barrel half woke changed his position  dozed again his head falling forward  his hairy breast as  minutes passed   rain still streamed against  windows  loathing   place   people came over charity the sight   weakminded old woman   cowed children   ragged man sleeping off his liquor made  setting  her own life seem  vision  peace  plenty she thought   kitchen  mr royalls   scrubbed floor  dresser full  china   peculiar smell  yeast  coffee  softsoap  she had always hated but  now seemed  very symbol  household order she saw mr royalls room   highbacked horsehair chair  faded rag carpet  row  books   shelf  engraving  “the surrender  burgoyne” over  stove   mat   brown  white spaniel   mossgreen border and then her mind travelled  miss hatchards house where all  freshness purity  fragrance  compared  which  red house had always seemed so poor  plain “this  where i belongthis  where i belong” she kept repeating  herself but  words had no meaning  her every instinct  habit made her  stranger among these poor swamppeople living like vermin  their lair with all her soul she wished she had not yielded  harneys curiosity  brought him there the rain had drenched her  she began  shiver under  thin folds  her dress the younger woman must have noticed it  she went out   room  came back   broken teacup which she offered  charity it  half full  whiskey  charity shook her head but harney took  cup  put his lips  it when  had set  down charity saw him feel  his pocket  draw out  dollar  hesitated  moment  then put  back  she guessed   did not wish her  see him offering money  people she had spoken   being her kin the sleeping man stirred lifted his head  opened his eyes they rested vacantly   moment  charity  harney  then closed again  his head drooped but  look  anxiety came into  womans face she glanced out   window  then came up  harney “i guess you better go along now” she said the young man understood  got  his feet “thank you”  said holding out his hand she seemed not  notice  gesture  turned away  they opened  door the rain  still coming down but they hardly noticed it  pure air  like balm  their faces the clouds  rising  breaking  between their edges  light streamed down  remote blue hollows harney untied  horse  they drove off through  diminishing rain which  already beaded  sunlight for  while charity  silent  her companion did not speak she looked timidly  his profile   graver than usual  though  too  oppressed  what they had seen then she broke out abruptly “those people back there   kind  folks i come from they may  my relations  all i know” she did not want him  think  she regretted having told him her story “poor creatures”  rejoined “i wonder why they came down   feverhole” she laughed ironically “to better themselves its worse up   mountain bash hyatt married  daughter   farmer  used  own  brown house that  him   stove i suppose” harney seemed  find nothing  say  she went on “i saw you take out  dollar  give   poor woman why did you put  back” he reddened  leaned forward  flick  swampfly   horses neck “i wasnt sure” “was  because you knew they  my folks  thought id  ashamed  see you give them money” he turned  her  eyes full  reproach “oh charity” it   first time  had ever called her  her name her misery welled over “i ainti aint ashamed theyre my people  i aint ashamed  them” she sobbed “my dear”  murmured putting his arm about her  she leaned against him  wept out her pain it  too late  go around  hamblin  all  stars  out   clear sky when they reached  north dormer valley  drove up   red house vii since her reinstatement  miss hatchards favour charity had not dared  curtail   moment her hours  attendance   library she even made  point  arriving

than usually taciturn had betrayed no surprise  made no comment in itself this indifference  not particularly significant  mr royall  common  most  his fellowcitizens had  way  accepting events passively  if  had long since come   conclusion  no one who lived  north dormer could hope  modify them but  charity   reaction  her mood  passionate exaltation there  something disquieting  his silence it  almost  if lucius harney had never had  part  their lives mr royalls imperturbable indifference seemed  relegate him   domain  unreality as she sat  work she tried  shake off her disappointment  harneys nonappearing some trifling incident had probably kept him  joining them  midday but she  sure  must  eager  see her again    would not want  wait till they met  supper between

middleaged man   baldness showing under his clerical hat  spectacles  his grecian nose she wondered what had called him  north dormer   weekday  felt  little hurt  harney should have brought him   library it presently appeared  his presence there  due  miss hatchard he had been spending  few days  springfield  fill  friends pulpit  had been consulted  miss hatchard   young harneys plan  ventilating  “memorial” to lay hands   hatchard ark   grave matter  miss hatchard always full  scruples about her scruples it  harneys phrase wished  have mr miless opinion before deciding “i couldnt” mr miles explained “quite make out  your cousin what changes you wanted  make    other trustees did not understand either i thought i had better drive over  take  lookthough im sure”  added turning his friendly spectacles   young man “that no one could  more competentbut  course this spot   peculiar sanctity” “i hope  little fresh air wont desecrate it” harney laughingly rejoined  they walked   other end   library while  set forth his idea   rector mr miles had greeted  two girls  his usual friendliness but charity saw    occupied  other things  she presently became aware   scraps  conversation drifting over  her    still under  charm  his visit  springfield which appeared  have been full  agreeable incidents “ah  coopersons yes you know them  course” she heard “thats  fine old

privilege  hearing them again   towers beautifully done bach  beethoven  lawnparty first i saw miss balch several times   way looking extremely handsome” charity dropped her pencil  forgot  listen   targatt girls singsong why had mr miles suddenly brought up annabel balchs name “oh really” she heard harney rejoin and raising his stick  pursued “you see my plan   move these shelves away  open  round window  this wall   axis   one under  pediment” “i suppose shell  coming up here later  stay  miss hatchard” mr miles went on following  his train  thought then spinning about  tilting his head back “yes yes i seei understand   give  draught without materially altering  look  things i can see no objection” the discussion went   some minutes  gradually  two men moved back toward  desk mr

charity  harney  sitting   hyatts hovel between  drunkard   halfwitted old woman charity did not know exactly what  gardenparty was but her glimpse   floweredged lawns  nettleton helped her  visualize  scene  envious recollections   “old things” which miss balch avowedly “wore out” when she came  north dormer made  only too easy  picture her  her splendour charity understood what associations  name must have called up  felt  uselessness  struggling against  unseen influences  harneys life when she came down  her room  supper   not there  while she waited   porch she recalled  tone  which mr royall had commented  day before  their early start mr royall sat  her side his chair tilted back his broad black boots  sideelastics resting against  lower bar   railings his rumpled grey hair stood up above his forehead like  crest   angry bird   leatherbrown  his veined cheeks  blotched  red charity knew  those red spots   signs   coming explosion suddenly  said “wheres supper has verena marsh slipped up again  her sodabiscuits” charity threw  startled glance  him “i presume shes waiting  mr harney” “mr harney  she shed better dish up then he aint coming” he stood up walked   door  called out   pitch necessary  penetrate  old womans tympanum “get along   supper verena” charity  trembling  apprehension something had happenedshe  sure   nowand mr royall knew what  was but not   world would she have gratified him  showing her anxiety she took her usual place   seated himself opposite  poured out  strong cup  tea before passing her  teapot verena brought some scrambled eggs   piled his plate  them “aint you going  take any”  asked charity roused herself  began  eat the tone  which mr royall had said “hes not coming” seemed  her full   ominous satisfaction she saw   had suddenly begun  hate lucius harney  guessed herself    cause  this change  feeling but she had no means  finding out whether some act  hostility  his part had made  young man stay away or whether  simply wished  avoid seeing her again after their drive back   brown house she ate her supper   studied show  indifference but she knew  mr royall  watching her   her agitation did not escape him after supper she went up  her room she heard mr royall cross  passage  presently  sounds below her window showed   had returned   porch she seated herself  her bed  began  struggle against  desire  go down  ask him what had happened “id rather die than do it” she muttered  herself with  word  could have relieved her uncertainty but never would she gratify him  saying it she rose  leaned out   window the twilight had deepened into night  she watched  frail curve   young moon dropping   edge   hills through  darkness she saw one or two figures moving down  road but  evening  too cold  loitering  presently  strollers disappeared lamps  beginning  show here  there   windows a bar  light brought out  whiteness   clump  lilies   hawess yard  farther down  street carrick frys rochester lamp cast  bold illumination   rustic flowertub   middle  his grassplot for  long time she continued  lean   window but  fever  unrest consumed her  finally she went downstairs took her hat   hook  swung out   house mr royall sat   porch verena beside him her old hands crossed  her patched skirt as charity went down  steps mr royall called after her “where you going” she could easily have answered “to ormas” or “down   targatts”  either answer might have been true  she had no purpose but she swept   silence determined not  recognize his right  question her at  gate she paused  looked up  down  road the darkness drew her  she thought  climbing  hill  plunging into  depths   larchwood above  pasture then she glanced irresolutely along  street   she did so  gleam appeared through  spruces  miss hatchards gate lucius harney  there thenhe had not gone down  hepburn  mr miles  she had  first imagined but where had  taken his evening meal  what had caused him  stay away  mr royalls the light  positive proof  his presence  miss hatchards servants  away   holiday  her farmers wife came only   mornings  make  young mans bed  prepare his coffee beside  lamp   doubtless sitting  this moment to know  truth charity had only  walk half  length   village  knock   lighted window she hesitated  minute or two longer  then turned toward miss hatchards she walked quickly straining her eyes  detect anyone who might  coming along  street  before reaching  frys she crossed over  avoid  light  their window whenever she  unhappy she felt herself  bay against  pitiless world   kind  animal secretiveness possessed her but  street  empty  she passed unnoticed through  gate  up  path   house its white front glimmered indistinctly through  trees showing only one oblong  light   lower floor she had supposed   lamp   miss hatchards sittingroom but she now saw   shone through  window   farther corner   house she did not know  room  which this window belonged  she paused under  trees checked   sense  strangeness then she moved on treading softly   short grass  keeping so close   house  whoever    room even if roused  her approach would not  able  see her the window opened   narrow verandah   trellised arch she leaned close   trellis  parting  sprays  clematis  covered  looked into  corner   room she saw  foot   mahogany bed  engraving   wall  washstand  which  towel had been tossed  one end   greencovered table which held  lamp half   lampshade projected into her field  vision  just under  two smooth sunburnt hands one holding  pencil   other  ruler  moving   fro over  drawingboard her heart jumped  then stood still he  there  few feet away  while her soul  tossing  seas  woe  had been quietly sitting  his drawingboard the sight  those two hands moving  their usual skill  precision woke her out  her dream her eyes  opened   disproportion between what she had felt   cause  her agitation  she  turning away   window when one hand abruptly pushed aside  drawingboard   other flung down  pencil charity had often noticed harneys loving care  his drawings   neatness  method  which  carried   concluded each task the impatient sweeping aside   drawingboard seemed  reveal  new mood the gesture suggested sudden discouragement or distaste  his work  she wondered if  too  agitated  secret perplexities her impulse  flight  checked she stepped up   verandah  looked into  room harney had put his elbows   table   resting his chin  his locked hands he had taken off his coat  waistcoat  unbuttoned  low collar  his flannel shirt she saw  vigorous lines  his young throat   root   muscles where they joined  chest he sat staring straight ahead  him  look  weariness  selfdisgust  his face   almost  if  had been gazing   distorted reflection  his own features for  moment charity looked  him   kind  terror  if  had been  stranger under familiar lineaments then she glanced past him  saw   floor  open portmanteau half full  clothes she understood    preparing  leave    had probably decided  go without seeing her she saw   decision  whatever cause   taken had disturbed him deeply  she immediately concluded  his change  plan  due  some surreptitious interference  mr royalls all her old resentments  rebellions flamed up confusedly mingled   yearning roused  harneys nearness only  few hours earlier she had felt secure  his comprehending pity now she  flung back  herself doubly alone after  moment  communion harney  still unaware  her presence he sat without moving moodily staring before him   same spot   wallpaper he had not even had  energy  finish his packing  his clothes  papers lay   floor about  portmanteau presently  unlocked his clasped hands  stood up  charity drawing back hastily sank down   step   verandah the night  so dark  there  not much chance  his seeing her unless  opened  window  before  she would have time  slip away   lost   shadow   trees he stood   minute or two looking around  room   same expression  selfdisgust  if  hated himself  everything about him then  sat down again   table drew  few more strokes  threw his pencil aside finally  walked across  floor kicking  portmanteau out  his way  lay down   bed folding his arms under his head  staring up morosely   ceiling just so charity had seen him  her side   grass or  pineneedles his eyes fixed   sky  pleasure flashing over his face like  flickers  sun  branches shed  it but now  face  so changed  she hardly knew it  grief  his grief gathered  her throat rose  her eyes  ran over she continued  crouch   steps holding her breath  stiffening herself into complete immobility one motion  her hand one tap   pane  she could picture  sudden change  his face in every pulse  her rigid body she  aware   welcome his eyes  lips would give her but something kept her  moving it  not  fear  any sanction human or heavenly she had never  her life been afraid it  simply  she had suddenly understood what would happen if she went in it   thing  did happen between young men  girls   north dormer ignored  public  snickered over   sly it  what miss hatchard  still ignorant of but every girl  charitys class knew about before she left school it  what had happened  ally hawess sister julia  had ended  her going  nettleton   peoples never mentioning her name it did not  course always end so sensationally nor perhaps   whole so untragically charity had always suspected   shunned julias fate might have  compensations there  others worse endings   village knew of mean miserable unconfessed other lives  went  drearily without visible change   same cramped setting  hypocrisy but these  not  reasons  held her back since  day before she had known exactly what she would feel if harney should take her  his arms  melting  palm into palm  mouth  mouth   long flame burning her  head  foot but mixed  this feeling  another  wondering pride  his liking  her  startled softness  his sympathy had put into her heart sometimes when her youth flushed up  her she had imagined yielding like other girls  furtive caresses   twilight but she could not so cheapen herself  harney she did not know why   going but since   going she felt she must do nothing  deface  image  her   carried away if  wanted her  must seek her  must not  surprised into taking her  girls like julia hawes  taken no sound came   sleeping village    deep darkness   garden she heard now  then  secret rustle  branches  though some nightbird brushed them once  footfall passed  gate  she shrank back into her corner but  steps died away  left  profounder quiet her eyes  still  harneys tormented face she felt she could not move till  moved but she  beginning  grow numb  her constrained position   times her thoughts  so indistinct  she seemed   held there only   vague weight  weariness a long time passed  this strange vigil harney still lay   bed motionless   fixed eyes  though following his vision   bitter end at last  stirred  changed his attitude slightly  charitys heart began  tremble but  only flung out his arms  sank back into his former position with  deep sigh  tossed  hair  his forehead then his whole body relaxed his head turned sideways   pillow  she saw   had fallen asleep the sweet expression came back  his lips   haggardness faded  his face leaving   fresh   boys she rose  crept away viii she had lost  sense  time  did not know how late   till she came out into  street  saw  all  windows  dark between miss hatchards   royall house as she passed  under  black pall   norway spruces she fancied she saw two figures   shade about  duckpond she drew back  watched but nothing moved  she had stared so long into  lamplit room   darkness confused her  she thought she must have been mistaken she walked on wondering whether mr royall  still   porch in her exalted mood she did not greatly care whether   waiting  her or not she seemed   floating high over life   great cloud  misery beneath which everyday realities had dwindled  mere specks  space but  porch  empty mr royalls hat hung   peg   passage   kitchen lamp had been left  light her  bed she took   went up the morning hours   next day dragged  without incident charity had imagined that  some way or other she would learn whether harney had already left but verenas deafness prevented her being  source  news  no one came   house who could bring enlightenment mr royall went out early  did not return till verena had set  table   midday meal when  came   went straight   kitchen  shouted   old woman “ready  dinner” then  turned into  diningroom where charity  already seated harneys plate    usual place but mr royall offered no explanation  his absence  charity asked none the feverish exaltation   night before had dropped  she said  herself   had gone away indifferently almost callously   now her life would lapse again into  narrow rut out  which  had lifted it for  moment she  inclined  sneer  herself  not having used  arts  might have kept him she sat  table till  meal  over lest mr royall should remark  her leaving but when  stood up she rose also without waiting  help verena she had her foot   stairs when  called  her  come back “ive got  headache im going up  lie down” “i want you should come  here first ive got something  say  you” she  sure  his tone    moment she would learn what every nerve  her ached  know but  she turned back she made  last effort  indifference mr royall stood   middle   office his thick eyebrows beetling his lower jaw trembling  little at first she thought  had been drinking then she saw    sober but stirred   deep  stern emotion totally unlike his usual transient angers and suddenly she understood that until then she had never really noticed him or thought about him except   occasion  his one offense  had been  her merely  person who  always there  unquestioned central fact  life  inevitable but  uninteresting  north dormer itself or any   other conditions fate had laid  her even then she had regarded him only  relation  herself  had never speculated   his own feelings beyond instinctively concluding   would not trouble her again   same way but now she began  wonder what   really like he had grasped  back  his chair  both hands  stood looking hard  her at length  said “charity  once lets you  me talk together like friends” instantly she felt  something had happened    held her  his hand “where  mr harney why hasnt  come back have you sent him away” she broke out without knowing what she  saying the change  mr royall frightened her all  blood seemed  leave his veins  against his swarthy pallor  deep lines  his face looked black “didnt  have time  answer some  those questions last night you   him long enough”  said charity stood speechless the taunt  so unrelated  what had been happening  her soul  she hardly understood it but  instinct  selfdefense awoke  her “who says i   him last night” “the whole place  saying   now” “then   you  put  lie into their mouthsoh how ive always hated you” she cried she had expected  retort  kind   startled her  hear her exclamation sounding  through silence “yes i know” mr royall said slowly “but  aint going  help us much now” “it helps me not  care  straw what lies you tell about me” “if theyre lies theyre not my lies my bible oath  that charity i didnt know where you were i wasnt out  this house last night” she made no answer   went on “is   lie  you  seen coming out  miss hatchards nigh onto midnight” she straightened herself   laugh all her reckless insolence recovered “i didnt look  see what time  was” “you lost girl you you oh my god why did you tell me”  broke out dropping into his chair his head bowed down like  old mans charitys selfpossession had returned   sense  her danger “do you suppose id take  trouble  lie  you who  you anyhow  ask me where i go  when i go out  night” mr royall lifted his head  looked  her his face had grown quiet  almost gentle  she remembered seeing  sometimes when she   little girl before mrs royall died “dont lets go  like this charity it cant do any good  either  us you  seen going into  fellows house you  seen coming out  it ive watched this thing coming  ive tried  stop it as god sees me i have” “ah  was you then i knew   you  sent him away” he looked  her  surprise “didnt  tell you so i thought  understood” he spoke slowly  difficult pauses “i didnt

quietly enough he said his job here  about done anyhow  there didnt another word pass between us if  told you otherwise  told you  untruth” charity listened   cold trance  anger it  nothing  her what  village said but all this fingering  her dreams “ive told you  didnt tell me anything i didnt speak  him last night” “you didnt speak  him” “no its not  i care what any  you say but you may  well know things aint between us  way you think   other people  this place he  kind  me   my friend  all   sudden  stopped coming  i knew   you  done ityou” all her unreconciled memory   past flamed out  him “so i went there last night  find out what youd said  him thats all” mr royall drew  heavy breath “but thenif  wasnt there what  you doing there all  timecharity  pitys sake tell me ive got  know  stop their talking” this pathetic abdication  all authority over her did not move her she could feel only  outrage  his interference “cant you see  i dont care what anybody says its true i went there  see him     his room  i stood outside  ever so long  watched him but i dursnt go   fear hed think id come after him” she felt her voice breaking  gathered  up   last defiance “as long  i live ill never forgive you” she cried mr royall made no answer he sat  pondered  sunken head his veined hands clasped about  arms  his chair age seemed  have come down  him  winter comes   hills after  storm at length  looked up “charity you say you dont care but youre  proudest girl i know   last  want people  talk against you you know theres always eyes watching you youre handsomer  smarter than  rest

or even  attention “hes  pleasant fellow  talk toi liked having him here myself the young men up here aint had his chances but theres one thing  old   hills   plain  daylight if hed wanted you  right way hed have said so” charity did not speak it seemed  her  nothing could exceed  bitterness  hearing such words  such lips mr royall rose  his seat “see here charity royall i had  shameful thought

growing lassitude restrained her what did anything matter    saying she saw  old life closing   her  hardly heeded his fanciful picture  renewal “charitycharitysay youll do it” she heard him urge all his lost years  wasted passion  his voice “oh whats  use  all this when i leave here  wont   you” she moved toward  door  she spoke   stood up  placed himself between her   threshold he seemed suddenly tall  strong  though  extremity  his humiliation had given him new vigour “thats all  it its not much” he leaned against  door so towering  powerful   seemed  fill  narrow room “well then look here youre right ive no claim  youwhy should you look   broken man like me you want  other fellow  i dont blame you you picked out  best when you seen it well   always my way” he fixed his stern eyes  her  she had  sense   struggle within him    highest “do you want him  marry you”  asked they stood  looked  each other   long moment eye  eye   terrible equality  courage  sometimes made her feel  if she had his blood  her veins “do you want him tosay ill have him here   hour if you do i aint been   law thirty years  nothing hes hired carrick frys team  take him  hepburn but  aint going  start  another hour and i can put things  him so  wont  long deciding hes soft i could see that i dont say you wont  sorry afterwardbut  god ill give you  chance  be if you say so” she heard him out  silence too remote  all   feeling  saying  any sally  scorn  relieve her as she listened there flitted through her mind  vision  liff hyatts muddy boot coming down   white brambleflowers the same thing had happened now something transient  exquisite had flowered  her  she had stood   seen  trampled  earth while  thought passed through her she  aware  mr royall still leaning against  door but crestfallen diminished  though her silence   answer  most dreaded “i dont want any chance you can give me im glad hes going away” she said he kept his place  moment longer his hand   doorknob “charity”  pleaded she made no answer   turned  knob  went out she heard him fumble   latch   front door  saw him walk down  steps he passed out   gate  his figure stooping  heavy receded slowly up  street for  while she remained where  had left her she  still trembling   humiliation  his last words which rang so loud  her ears   seemed  though they must echo through  village proclaiming her  creature  lend herself  such vile suggestions her shame weighed  her like  physical oppression  roof  walls seemed   closing   her  she  seized   impulse  get away under  open sky where there would  room  breathe she went   front door   she did so lucius harney opened it he looked graver  less confident than usual    moment or two neither  them spoke then  held out his hand “are you going out”  asked “may i come in” her heart  beating so violently  she  afraid  speak  stood looking  him  teardilated eyes then she became aware  what her silence must betray  said quickly “yes come in” she led  way into  diningroom  they sat down  opposite sides   table  cruetstand  japanned breadbasket between them harney had laid his straw hat   table    sat there  his easylooking summer clothes  brown tie knotted under his flannel collar  his smooth brown hair brushed back  his forehead she pictured him  she had seen him  night before lying  his bed   tossed locks falling into his eyes  his bare throat rising out  his unbuttoned shirt he had never seemed so remote    moment when  vision flashed through her mind “im so sorry its goodbye i suppose you know im leaving”  began abruptly  awkwardly she guessed    wondering how much she knew  his reasons  going “i presume you found your work  over quicker than what you expected” she said “well yesthat is no there  plenty  things i should have liked  do but my holidays limited  now  mr royall needs  horse  himself its rather difficult  find means  getting about” “there aint any too many teams  hire around here” she acquiesced  there  another silence “these days here have beenawfully pleasant i wanted  thank you  making them so”  continued his colour rising she could not think  any reply   went on “youve been wonderfully kind  me  i wanted  tell you i wish i could think  you  happier less lonely things  sure  change  you   by” “things dont change  north dormer people just get used  them” the answer seemed  break up  order  his prearranged consolations   sat looking  her uncertainly then  said  his sweet smile “thats not true  you it cant be” the smile  like  knifethrust through her heart everything  her began  tremble  break loose she felt her tears run over  stood up “well goodbye” she said she  aware  his taking her hand   feeling  his touch  lifeless “goodbye” he turned away  stopped   threshold “youll say goodbye  me  verena” she heard  closing   outer door   sound  his quick tread along  path the latch   gate clicked after him the next morning when she arose   cold dawn  opened her shutters she saw  freckled boy standing   other side   road  looking up  her he   boy   farm three or four miles down  creston road  she wondered what   doing there   hour  why  looked so hard  her window when  saw her

 maidens lack  conversation  made up   tentative fondling but harney except when  had tried  comfort her  her trouble  their way back   hyatts had never put his arm about her or sought  betray her into any sudden caress it seemed   enough  him  breathe her nearness like  flowers  since his pleasure  being  her  his sense  her youth  her grace perpetually shone  his eyes  softened  inflection  his voice his reserve did not suggest coldness but  deference due   girl  his own class the buggy  drawn   old trotter who whirled them along so briskly   pace created  little breeze but when they reached hepburn  full heat   airless morning descended  them at  railway station  platform  packed   sweltering throng  they took refuge   waitingroom where there  another throng already dejected

roared into  nettleton station  descending mob caught them   tide  they  swept out into  vague dusty square thronged  seedy “hacks”  long curtained omnibuses drawn  horses  tasselled flynets over their withers who stood swinging their depressed heads drearily  side  side a mob  bus  hack drivers  shouting “to  eagle house” “to  washington house” “this way   lake” “just starting  greytop”  through their yells came  popping  firecrackers  explosion  torpedoes  banging  toyguns   crash   firemens band trying  play  merry widow while they  being packed into  waggonette streaming  bunting

familiar   rolling music  his voice when  read aloud or held forth   selectmen about  stove  carrick frys today his inflections  richer  graver than she had ever known them  spoke slowly  pauses  seemed  invite his hearers  silent participation  his thought  charity perceived  light  response  their faces he  nearing  end  his address “most  you”  said “most  you who have returned here today

expected but  moved them more than what they had expected would have moved them “hear hear”  voice cried out   middle   hall an outburst  cheers caught up  cry   they subsided charity heard mr miles saying  someone near him “that   man talking” he wiped his spectacles mr royall had stepped back   desk  taken his seat   row  chairs  front   harmonium a dapper whitehaired gentlemana distant hatchardsucceeded him behind  goldenrod  began  say beautiful things about  old oaken bucket patient whitehaired mothers  where  boys used  go nutting  charity began again  search  harney suddenly mr

had resumed his place  front   harmonium  sat close  her his eyes  her face  his look seemed  pierce   very centre  her confused sensations a feeling  physical sickness rushed over herand then deadly apprehension the light   fiery hours   little house swept back  her   glare  fear she forced herself  look away  her guardian  became aware   oratory   hatchard cousin had ceased   mr miles  again flapping his wings fragments  his peroration floated through her bewildered brain “a rich harvest  hallowed memories a sanctified hour  which  moments  trial your thoughts  prayerfully return and now

“auld lang syne” charity stared straight ahead  her  then dropping her flowers fell face downward  mr royalls feet xiv north dormers celebration naturally included  villages attached   township

creston river   fourth  principal performers    driven  buckboards  dormer  hamblin it    fourth day  charity returned   first time   little house she had not seen harney alone since they had parted   woods edge  night before  celebrations began in  interval she had passed through many moods but   moment  terror which had seized her   town hall had faded   edge  consciousness she had fainted because  hall  stiflingly hot  because  speakers had gone   on several other people had been affected   heat  had had  leave before  exercises  over there had been thunder   air all  afternoon  everyone said afterward  something ought  have been done  ventilate  hall at  dance  eveningwhere she had gone reluctantly  only because she feared  stay away she had sprung back into instant reassurance as soon  she entered she had seen harney waiting  her   had come up  kind gay eyes  swept her off   waltz her feet  full  music  though her only training had been   village youths she had no difficulty  tuning her steps  his as they circled about  floor all her vain fears dropped  her  she even forgot  she  probably dancing  annabel balchs slippers when  waltz  over harney   last handclasp left her  meet miss hatchard  miss balch who  just entering charity had  moment  anguish  miss balch appeared but  did not last the triumphant fact  her own greater beauty   harneys sense  it swept her apprehensions aside miss balch   unbecoming dress looked sallow  pinched  charity fancied there   worried expression  her palelashed eyes she took  seat near miss hatchard    presently apparent  she did not mean  dance charity did not dance often either harney explained  her  miss hatchard had begged him  give each   other girls  turn but  went through  form  asking charitys permission each time  led one out   gave her  sense  secret triumph even completer than when she  whirling about  room  him she  thinking  all this  she waited  him   deserted house the late afternoon  sultry  she had tossed aside her hat  stretched herself  full length   mexican blanket because   cooler indoors than under  trees she lay  her arms folded beneath her head gazing out   shaggy shoulder   mountain the sky behind   full   splintered glories   descending sun  before long she expected  hear harneys bicyclebell   lane he had bicycled  hamblin instead  driving there  his cousin  her friends so   might  able  make his escape earlier  stop   way back   deserted house which    road  hamblin they had smiled together   joke  hearing  crowded buckboards roll    return while they lay close  their hiding above  road such childish triumphs still gave her  sense  reckless security nevertheless she had not wholly forgotten  vision  fear  had opened before her   town hall the sense  lastingness  gone  her  every moment  harney would now  ringed  doubt the mountain  turning purple against  fiery sunset  which  seemed   divided   knifeedge  quivering light  above this wall  flame  whole sky   pure pale green like some cold mountain lake  shadow charity lay gazing up  it  watching   first white star her eyes  still fixed   upper reaches   sky when she became aware   shadow had flitted across  gloryflooded room  must have been harney passing  window against  sunset she half raised herself  then dropped back  her folded arms the combs had slipped  her hair   trailed   rough dark rope across her breast she lay quite still  sleepy smile  her lips her indolent lids half shut there   fumbling   padlock  she called out “have you slipped  chain” the door opened  mr royall walked into  room she started up sitting back against  cushions  they looked  each other without speaking then mr royall closed  doorlatch  advanced  few steps charity jumped  her feet “what have you come for” she stammered the last glare   sunset   her guardians face which looked ashcoloured   yellow radiance “because i knew you  here”  answered simply she had become conscious   hair hanging loose across her breast   seemed  though she could not speak  him till she had set herself  order she groped  her comb  tried  fasten up  coil mr royall silently watched her “charity”  said “hell  here   minute let me talk  you first” “youve got no right  talk  me i can do what i please” “yes what   you mean  do” “i neednt answer that or anything else” he had glanced away  stood looking curiously about  illuminated room purple asters  red mapleleaves filled  jar   table   shelf against  wall stood  lamp  kettle  little pile  cups  saucers the canvas chairs  grouped about  table “so this  where you meet”  said his tone  quiet  controlled   fact disconcerted her she had been ready  give him violence  violence but this calm acceptance  things  they  left her without  weapon “see here charityyoure always telling me ive got no rights over you there might  two ways  looking  thatbut i aint going  argue it all i know  i raised you  good  i could  meant fairly  you always except once   bad halfhour theres no justice  weighing  halfhour against  rest  you know it if you hadnt you wouldnt have gone  living under my roof seems  me  fact  your doing  gives me some sort   right  right  try  keep you out  trouble im not asking you  consider any other” she listened  silence  then gave  slight laugh “better wait till im  trouble” she said he paused  moment  if weighing her words “is  all your answer” “yes thats all” “wellill wait” he turned away slowly but   did so  thing she had been waiting  happened  door opened again  harney entered he stopped short   face  astonishment  then quickly controlling himself went up  mr royall   frank look “have you come  see me sir”  said coolly throwing his cap   table   air  proprietorship mr royall again looked slowly about  room then his eyes turned   young man “is this your house”  inquired harney laughed “wellas much  its anybodys i come here  sketch occasionally” “and  receive miss royalls visits” “when she does me  honour” “is this  home you propose  bring her  when you get married” there   immense  oppressive silence charity quivering  anger started forward  then stood silent too humbled  speech harneys eyes had dropped under  old mans gaze but  raised them presently  looking steadily  mr royall said “miss royall  not  child isnt  rather absurd  talk  her  if she were i believe she considers herself free  come  go  she pleases without any questions  anyone” he paused  added “im ready  answer any she wishes  ask me” mr royall turned  her “ask him when hes going  marry you then” there  another silence   laughed  his turna broken laugh   scraping sound  it “you darsnt”  shouted out  sudden passion he went close up  charity his right arm lifted not  menace but  tragic exhortation “you darsnt  you know itand you know why” he swung back again upon  young man “and you know why you aint asked her  marry you  why you dont mean to its because you hadnt need to nor any other man either im  only one   fool enough not  know that  i guess nobodyll repeat my mistakenot  eagle county anyhow they all know what she is  what she came from they all know her mother   woman   town  nettleton  followed one  those mountain fellows up  his place  lived there  him like  heathen i saw her there sixteen years ago when i went  bring this child down i went  save her   kind  life her mother  leadingbut id better have left her   kennel she came from” he paused  stared darkly   two young people  out beyond them   menacing mountain   rim  fire then  sat down beside  table  which they had so often spread their rustic supper  covered his face  his hands harney leaned   window  frown  his face   twirling between his fingers  small package  dangled   loop  string charity heard mr royall draw  hard breath or two  his shoulders shook  little presently  stood up  walked across  room he did not look again   young people they saw him feel his way   door  fumble   latch  then  went out into  darkness after  had gone there   long silence charity waited  harney  speak but  seemed  first not  find anything  say at length  broke out irrelevantly “i wonder how  found out” she made no answer   tossed down  package  had been holding  went up  her “im so sorry dear  this should have happened” she threw her head back proudly “i aint ever been sorrynot  minute” “no” she waited   caught into his arms but  turned away  her irresolutely the last glow  gone  behind  mountain everything   room had turned grey  indistinct   autumnal dampness crept up   hollow below  orchard laying  cold touch  their flushed faces harney walked  length   room  then turned back  sat down   table “come”  said imperiously she sat down beside him   untied  string about  package  spread out  pile  sandwiches “i stole them   lovefeast  hamblin”  said   laugh pushing them over  her she laughed too  took one  began  eat “didnt you make  tea” “no” she said “i forgot” “oh wellits too late  boil  water now” he said nothing more  sitting opposite  each other they went  silently eating  sandwiches darkness had descended   little room  harneys face   dim blur  charity suddenly  leaned across  table  laid his hand  hers “i shall have  go off   whilea month or two perhapsto arrange some things  then ill come back  well get married” his voice seemed like  strangers nothing  left     vibrations she knew her hand lay inertly under his  she left  there  raised her head trying  answer him but  words died  her throat they sat motionless  their attitude  confident endearment  if some strange death had surprised them at length harney sprang  his feet   slight shiver “god its dampwe couldnt have come here much longer” he went   shelf took down  tin candlestick  lit  candle then  propped  unhinged shutter against  empty windowframe  put  candle   table it threw  queer shadow  his frowning forehead  made  smile  his lips  grimace “but its been good though hasnt it charity whats  matterwhy do you stand there staring  me havent  days here been good” he went up  her  caught her  his breast “and therell  otherslots  others jollier even jollier wont there darling” he turned her head back feeling   curve  her throat below  ear  kissing here there    hair  eyes  lips she clung  him desperately    drew her  his knees   couch she felt  if they  being sucked down together into some bottomless abyss xv that night  usual they said goodbye   woods edge harney   leave  next morning early he asked charity  say nothing  their plans till his return and strangely even  herself she  glad   postponement a leaden weight  shame hung  her benumbing every other sensation  she bade him goodbye  hardly  sign  emotion his reiterated promises  return seemed almost wounding she had no doubt   intended  come back her doubts  far deeper  less definable since  fanciful vision   future  had flitted through her imagination  their first meeting she had hardly ever thought  his marrying her she had not had  put  thought  her mind  had not been there if ever she looked ahead she felt instinctively   gulf between them  too deep    bridge their passion had flung across    insubstantial   rainbow but she seldom looked ahead each day  so rich   absorbed her now her first feeling   everything would  different   she herself would   different being  harney instead  remaining separate  absolute she would  compared  other people  unknown things would  expected  her she  too proud   afraid but  freedom  her spirit drooped harney had not fixed any date  his return  had said  would have  look about first  settle things he had promised  write  soon  there  anything definite  say  had left her his address  asked her  write also but  address frightened her it   new york   club   long name  fifth avenue  seemed  raise  insurmountable barrier between them once or twice   first days she got out  sheet  paper  sat looking  it  trying  think what  say but she had  feeling  her letter would never reach  destination she had never written  anyone farther away than hepburn harneys first letter came after  had been gone about ten days it  tender but grave  bore no resemblance   gay little notes  had sent her   freckled boy  creston river he spoke positively  his intention  coming back but named no date  reminded charity  their agreement  their plans should not  divulged till  had had time  “settle things” when  would   could not yet foresee but she could count  his returning  soon   way  clear she read  letter   strange sense   coming  immeasurable distances  having lost most   meaning   way   reply she sent him  coloured postcard  creston falls  which she wrote “with love  charity” she felt  pitiful inadequacy  this  understood   sense  despair   her inability  express herself she must give him  impression  coldness  reluctance but she could not help it she could not forget   had never spoken  her  marriage till mr royall had forced  word  his lips though she had not had  strength  shake off  spell  bound her  him she had lost all spontaneity  feeling  seemed  herself   passively awaiting  fate she could not avert she had not seen mr royall  her return   red house the morning after her parting  harney when she came down  her room verena told her  her guardian had gone off  worcester  portland it   time  year when  usually reported   insurance agencies  represented  there  nothing unusual  his departure except  suddenness she thought little about him except   glad   not there she kept  herself   first days while north dormer  recovering   brief plunge into publicity   subsiding agitation left her unnoticed but  faithful ally could not  long avoided for  first few days after  close   old home week festivities charity escaped her  roaming  hills all day when she  not  her post   library but after   period  rain set in  one pouring afternoon ally sure  she would find her friend indoors came around   red house  her sewing the two girls sat upstairs  charitys room charity her idle hands  her lap  sunk   kind  leaden dream through which she  only halfconscious  ally who sat opposite her   low rushbottomed chair her work pinned  her knee  her thin lips pursed up  she bent above it “it  my idea running  ribbon through  gauging” she said proudly drawing back  contemplate  blouse she  trimming “its  miss balch she  awfully pleased” she paused  then added   queer tremor  her piping voice “i darsnt have told her i got  idea  one i saw  julia” charity raised her eyes listlessly “do you still see julia sometimes” ally reddened  if  allusion had escaped her unintentionally “oh    long time ago i seen her  those gaugings” silence fell again  ally presently continued “miss balch left me  whole lot  things  do over this time” “whyhas she gone” charity inquired   inner start  apprehension “didnt you know she went off  morning after they had  celebration  hamblin i seen her drive  early  mr harney” there  another silence measured   steady tick   rain against  window and  intervals   snipping sound  allys scissors ally gave  meditative laugh “do you know what she told me before she went away she told me she  going  send  me  come over  springfield  make some things  her wedding” charity again lifted her heavy lids  stared  allys pale pointed face which moved   fro above her moving fingers “is she going  get married” ally let  blouse sink  her knee  sat gazing  it her lips seemed suddenly dry  she moistened them  little  her tongue “why i presume so  what she said didnt you know” “why should i know” ally did not answer she bent above  blouse  began picking out  basting thread   point   scissors “why should i know” charity repeated harshly “i didnt know but what folks here say shes engaged  mr harney” charity stood up   laugh  stretched her arms lazily above her head “if all  people got married  folks say  going  youd have your time full making weddingdresses” she said ironically “whydont you believe it” ally ventured “it would not make  true if i didnor prevent  if i didnt” “thats so i only know i seen her crying  night   party because her dress didnt set right that  why she wouldnt dance any” charity stood absently gazing down   lacy garment  allys knee abruptly she stooped  snatched  up “well i guess she wont dance  this either” she said  sudden violence  grasping  blouse  her strong young hands she tore   two  flung  tattered bits   floor “oh charity” ally cried springing up for  long interval  two girls faced each other across  ruined garment ally burst into tears “oh whatll i say  her whatll i do it  real lace” she wailed between her piping sobs charity glared  her unrelentingly “youd oughtnt  have brought  here” she said breathing quickly “i hate other peoples clothesits just  if they  there themselves” the two stared  each other again over this avowal till charity brought out   gasp  anguish “oh gogogoor ill hate you too” when ally left her she fell sobbing across her bed the long storm  followed   northwest gale  when   over  hills took  their first umber tints  sky grew more densely blue   big white clouds lay against  hills like snowbanks the first crisp mapleleaves began  spin across miss hatchards lawn   virginia creeper   memorial splashed  white porch  scarlet it   golden triumphant september day  day  flame   virginia creeper spread   hillsides  wider waves  carmine  crimson  larches glowed like  thin yellow halo about  fire  maples blazed  smouldered   black hemlocks turned  indigo against  incandescence   forest the nights  cold   dry glitter  stars so high up  they seemed smaller  more vivid sometimes  charity lay sleepless  her bed through  long hours she felt  though she  bound  those wheeling fires  swinging  them around  great black vault at night she planned many things   then she wrote  harney but  letters  never put  paper  she did not know how  express what she wanted  tell him so she waited since her talk  ally she had felt sure  harney  engaged  annabel balch    process  “settling things” would involve  breaking  this tie her first rage  jealousy over she felt no fear  this score she  still sure  harney would come back  she  equally sure that   moment  least   she whom  loved  not miss balch yet  girl no less remained  rival since she represented all  things  charity felt herself most incapable  understanding or achieving annabel balch was if not  girl harney ought  marry  least  kind  girl  would  natural  him  marry charity had never been able  picture herself  his wife had never been able  arrest  vision  follow  out   daily consequences but she could perfectly imagine annabel balch   relation  him the more she thought  these things  more  sense  fatality weighed  her she felt  uselessness  struggling against  circumstances she had never known how  adapt herself she could only break  tear  destroy the scene  ally had left her stricken  shame  her own childish savagery what would harney have thought if  had witnessed it but when she turned  incident over  her puzzled mind she could not imagine what  civilized person would have done  her place she felt herself too unequally pitted against unknown forces at length this feeling moved her  sudden action she took  sheet  letter paper  mr royalls office  sitting   kitchen lamp one night after verena had gone  bed began her first letter  harney it  very short i want you should marry annabel balch if you promised to i think maybe you  afraid id feel too bad about it i feel id rather you acted right your loving charity she posted  letter early  next morning    few days her heart felt strangely light then she began  wonder why she received no answer one day  she sat alone   library pondering these things  walls  books began  spin around her   rosewood desk  rock under her elbows the dizziness  followed   wave  nausea like  she had felt   day   exercises   town hall but  town hall had been crowded  stiflingly hot   library  empty  so chilly  she had kept  her jacket five minutes before she had felt perfectly well  now  seemed  if she  going  die the bit  lace  which she still languidly worked dropped  her fingers   steel crochet hook clattered   floor she pressed her temples hard between her damp hands steadying herself against  desk while  wave  sickness swept over her little  little  subsided  after  few minutes she stood up shaken  terrified groped  her hat  stumbled out into  air but  whole sunlit autumn whirled reeled  roared around her  she dragged herself along  interminable length   road home as she approached  red house she saw  buggy standing   door  her heart gave  leap but   only mr royall who got out his travellingbag  hand he saw her coming  waited   porch she  conscious    looking  her intently  if there  something strange  her appearance  she threw back her head   desperate effort  ease their eyes met  she said “you back”  if nothing had happened   answered “yes im back”  walked  ahead  her pushing open  door  his office she climbed  her room every step   stairs holding her fast  if her feet  lined  glue two days later she descended   train  nettleton  walked out   station into  dusty square the brief interval  cold

over their withers swayed their heads drearily   fro she recognized  staring signs over  eatinghouses  billiard saloons   long lines  wires  lofty poles tapering down  main street   park   other end taking  way  wires pointed she went  hastily  bent head till she reached  wide transverse street   brick building   corner she crossed this street  glanced furtively up   front   brick building then she returned  entered  door opening   flight  steep brassrimmed stairs on  second landing she rang  bell   mulatto girl   bushy head   frilled apron let her into  hall where  stuffed fox  his hind legs proffered  brass cardtray  visitors at  back   hall   glazed door marked “office” after waiting  few minutes   handsomely furnished room  plush sofas surmounted  large goldframed photographs  showy young women charity  shown into  office when she came out   glazed door dr merkle followed  led her into another room smaller  still more crowded  plush  gold frames dr merkle   plump woman  small bright eyes  immense mass  black hair coming down low  her forehead  unnaturally white  even teeth she wore  rich black dress  gold chains  charms hanging  her bosom her hands  large  smooth

till then had been conscious only   vague selfdisgust   frightening physical distress now   sudden there came  her  grave surprise  motherhood she had come  this dreadful place because she knew  no other way  making sure  she  not mistaken about her state   woman had taken her   miserable creature like julia the thought  so horrible  she sprang up white  shaking one  her great rushes  anger sweeping over her dr merkle still smiling also rose “why do you run off  such  hurry you can stretch out right here  my sofa” she paused  her smile grew more motherly “afterwardsif theres been any

she stammered her hand   knob but   swift movement dr merkle edged her   threshold “oh very well five dollars please” charity looked helplessly   doctors tight lips  rigid face her last savings had gone  repaying ally   cost  miss balchs ruined blouse  she had had  borrow four dollars  her friend  pay  her railway ticket  cover  doctors fee it had never occurred  her  medical advice could cost more than two dollars “i didnt know i havent got  much” she faltered bursting into tears dr merkle gave  short laugh which did not show her teeth  inquired  concision if charity supposed she ran  establishment  her own amusement she leaned her firm shoulders against  door  she spoke like  grim gaoler making terms  her captive “you say youll come round  settle later ive heard  pretty often too give me your address  if you cant pay me ill send  bill  your folks what i cant understand what you say that dont suit you either my youre pretty particular   girl  aint got enough  settle her own

my line  i do  only   favour but if youre  mind  leave  brooch   pledge i dont say no yes  course you can get  back when you bring me my money” on  way home she felt  immense  unexpected quietude it had been horrible  have  leave harneys gift   womans hands but even   price  news she brought away had not been too dearly bought she sat  halfclosed eyes   train rushed through  familiar landscape  now  memories  her former journey instead  flying before her like dead leaves seemed   ripening  her blood like sleeping grain she would never again know what    feel herself alone everything seemed  have grown suddenly clear  simple she no longer had any difficulty  picturing herself  harneys wife now  she   mother  his child  compared  her sovereign right annabel balchs claim seemed no more than  girls sentimental fancy that evening   gate   red house she found ally waiting   dusk “i  down   postoffice just  they  closing up  will targatt said there   letter  you so i brought it” ally held out  letter looking  charity  piercing sympathy since  scene   torn blouse there had been  new  fearful admiration   eyes she bent  her friend charity snatched  letter   laugh “oh thank yougoodnight” she called out over her shoulder  she ran up  path if she had lingered  moment she knew she would have had ally  her heels she hurried upstairs  felt her way into her dark room her hands trembled  she groped   matches  lit her candle   flap   envelope  so closely stuck  she had  find her scissors  slit  open at length she read dear charity i have your letter   touches me more than i can say wont you trust me  return  do my best there  things   hard  explain much less  justify but your generosity makes everything easier all i can do now   thank you  my soul  understanding your telling me  you wanted me  do right  helped me beyond expression if ever there   hope  realizing what we dreamed  you  see me back   instant  i havent yet lost  hope she read  letter   rush then she went over  over it each time more slowly  painstakingly it  so beautifully expressed  she found  almost  difficult  understand   gentlemans explanation   bible pictures  nettleton but gradually she became aware   gist   meaning lay   last few words “if ever there   hope  realizing what we dreamed of” but then  wasnt even sure  that she understood now  every word  every reticence   avowal  annabel balchs prior claim it  true    engaged  her    had not yet found  way  breaking his engagement as she read  letter over charity understood what  must have cost him  write it he  not trying  evade  importunate claim   honestly  contritely struggling between opposing duties she did not even reproach him  her thoughts  having concealed  her    not free she could not see anything more reprehensible  his conduct than  her own from  first she had needed him more than  had wanted her   power  had swept them together had been  far beyond resistance   great gale loosening  leaves   forest only there stood between them fixed  upright   general upheaval  indestructible figure  annabel balch face  face  his admission   fact she sat staring   letter a cold tremor ran over her   hard sobs struggled up into her throat  shook her  head  foot for  while she  caught  tossed  great waves  anguish  left her hardly conscious  anything but  blind struggle against their assaults then little  little she began  relive   dreadful poignancy each separate stage  her poor romance foolish things she had said came back  her gay answers harney had made his first kiss   darkness between  fireworks their choosing  blue brooch together  way  had teased her about  letters she had dropped  her flight   evangelist all these memories   thousand others hummed through her brain till his nearness grew so vivid  she felt his fingers  her hair  his warm breath  her cheek   bent her head back like  flower these things  hers they had passed into her blood  become  part  her they  building  child  her womb   impossible  tear asunder strands  life so interwoven the conviction gradually strengthened her  she began  form  her mind  first words   letter she meant  write  harney she wanted  write   once   feverish hands she began  rummage  her drawer   sheet  letter paper but there  none left she must go downstairs  get it she had  superstitious feeling   letter must  written   instant  setting down her secret  words would bring her reassurance  safety  taking up her candle she went down  mr royalls office at  hour she  not likely  find him there  had probably had his supper  walked over  carrick frys she pushed open  door   unlit room   light  her lifted candle fell  his figure seated   darkness  his highbacked chair his arms lay along  arms   chair  his head  bent  little but  lifted  quickly  charity entered she started back  their eyes met remembering  her own  red  weeping   her face  livid   fatigue  emotion  her journey but   too late  escape  she stood  looked  him  silence he had risen  his chair  came toward her  outstretched hands the gesture  so unexpected  she let him take her hands  his  they stood thus without speaking till mr royall said gravely “charitywas you looking  me” she freed herself abruptly  fell back “me no” she set down  candle  his desk “i wanted some letterpaper thats all” his face contracted   bushy brows jutted forward over his eyes without answering  opened  drawer   desk took out  sheet  paper   envelope  pushed them toward her “do you want  stamp too”  asked she nodded   gave her  stamp as  did so she felt    looking  her intently  she knew   candle light flickering up  her white face must  distorting her swollen features  exaggerating  dark rings about her eyes she snatched up  paper her reassurance dissolving under his pitiless gaze  which she seemed  read  grim perception  her state   ironic recollection   day when   very room  had offered  compel harney  marry her his look seemed  say   knew she had taken  paper  write  her lover who had left her   had warned her she would  left she remembered  scorn  which she had turned  him  day  knew if  guessed  truth what  list  old scores  must settle she turned  fled upstairs but when she got back  her room all  words  had been waiting had vanished if she could have gone  harney  would have been different she would only have had  show herself  let his memories speak  her but she had no money left  there  no one  whom she could have borrowed enough  such  journey there  nothing  do but  write  await his reply for  long time she sat bent above  blank page but she found nothing  say  really expressed what she  feeling harney had written  she had made  easier  him  she  glad   so she did not want  make things hard she knew she had   her power  do that she held his fate  her hands all she had  do   tell him  truth but    very fact  held her back her five minutes face  face  mr royall had stripped her  her last illusion  brought her back  north dormers point  view distinctly  pitilessly there rose before her  fate   girl who  married “to make things right” she had seen too many village lovestories end   way poor rose coless miserable marriage    number  what good had come    her or  halston skeff they had hated each other   day  minister married them  whenever old mrs skeff had  fancy  humiliate her daughterinlaw she had only  say “whod ever think  babys only two and   seven months childaint   wonder what  size  is” north dormer had treasures  indulgence  brands   burning but only derision  those who succeeded  getting snatched  it  charity had always understood julia hawess refusal   snatched onlywas there no alternative but julias her soul recoiled   vision   whitefaced woman among  plush sofas  gilt frames in  established order  things  she knew them she saw no place  her individual adventure she sat  her chair without undressing till faint grey streaks began  divide  black slats   shutters then she stood up  pushed them open letting   light the coming   new day brought  sharper consciousness  ineluctable reality     sense   need  action she looked  herself   glass  saw her face white   autumn dawn  pinched cheeks  darkringed eyes  all  marks  her state  she herself would never have noticed but  dr merkles diagnosis had made plain  her she could not hope  those signs would escape  watchful village even before her figure lost  shape she knew her face would betray her leaning  her window she looked out   dark  empty scene  ashen houses  shuttered windows  grey road climbing  slope   hemlock belt above  cemetery   heavy mass   mountain black against  rainy sky to  east  space  light  broadening above  forest but over  also  clouds hung slowly her gaze travelled across  fields   rugged curve   hills she had looked out so often   lifeless circle  wondered if anything could ever happen  anyone who  enclosed  it almost without conscious thought her decision had been reached  her eyes had followed  circle   hills her mind had also travelled  old round she supposed   something  her blood  made  mountain  only answer  her questioning  inevitable escape  all  hemmed her   beset her at any rate  began  loom against  rainy dawn   longer she looked    more clearly she understood  now  last she  really going there xvi the rain held off   hour later when she started wild gleams  sunlight  blowing across  fields after harneys departure she had returned her bicycle   owner  creston  she  not sure  being able  walk all  way   mountain the deserted house    road but  idea  spending  night there  unendurable  she meant  try  push   hamblin where she could sleep under  woodshed if her strength should fail her her preparations had been made  quiet forethought before starting she had forced herself  swallow  glass  milk  eat  piece  bread  she had put  her canvas satchel  little packet   chocolate  harney always carried  his bicycle bag she wanted above all  keep up her strength  reach her destination without attracting notice mile  mile she retraced  road over which she had so often flown  her lover when she reached  turn where  woodroad branched off   creston highway she remembered  gospel tentlong since folded up  transplantedand her start  involuntary terror when  fat evangelist had said “your saviour knows everything come  confess your guilt” there  no sense  guilt  her now but only  desperate desire  defend her secret  irreverent eyes  begin life again among people  whom  harsh code   village  unknown the impulse did not shape itself  thought she only knew she must save her baby  hide herself   somewhere where no one would ever come  trouble them she walked   on growing more heavyfooted   day advanced it seemed  cruel chance  compelled her  retrace every step   way   deserted house  when she came  sight   orchard   silvergray roof slanting crookedly through  laden branches her strength failed her  she sat down   roadside she sat there  long time trying  gather  courage  start again  walk past  broken gate   untrimmed rosebushes strung  scarlet hips a few drops  rain  falling  she thought   warm evenings when she  harney had sat embraced   shadowy room   noise  summer showers   roof had rustled through their kisses at length she understood  if she stayed any longer  rain might compel her  take shelter   house overnight  she got up  walked on averting her eyes  she came abreast   white gate   tangled garden the hours wore on  she walked more  more slowly pausing now  then  rest   eat  little bread   apple picked up   roadside her body seemed  grow heavier  every yard   way  she wondered how she would  able  carry her child later if already  laid such  burden  her a fresh wind had sprung up scattering  rain  blowing down keenly   mountain presently  clouds lowered again   few white darts struck her   face    first snow falling over hamblin the roofs   lonely village  only half  mile ahead  she  resolved  push beyond it  try  reach  mountain  night she had no clear plan  action except that once   settlement she meant  look  liff hyatt  get him  take her  her mother she herself had been born  her own baby  going   born  whatever her mothers subsequent life had been she could hardly help remembering  past  receiving  daughter who  facing  trouble she had known suddenly  deadly faintness came over her once more  she sat down   bank  leaned her head against  treetrunk the long road   cloudy landscape vanished  her eyes    time she seemed   circling about  some terrible wheeling darkness then  too faded she opened her eyes  saw  buggy drawn up beside her   man who had jumped down     gazing  her   puzzled face slowly consciousness came back  she saw   man  liff hyatt she  dimly aware    asking her something  she looked  him  silence trying  find strength  speak at length her voice stirred  her throat  she said   whisper “im going up  mountain” “up  mountain”  repeated drawing aside  little    moved she saw behind him   buggy  heavily coated figure   familiar pink face  gold spectacles   bridge   grecian nose “charity what  earth  you doing here” mr miles exclaimed throwing  reins   horses back  scrambling down   buggy she lifted her heavy eyes  his “im going  see my mother” the two men glanced  each other    moment neither  them spoke then mr miles said “you look ill my dear  its  long way do you think its wise” charity stood up “ive got  go  her” a vague mirthless grin contracted liff hyatts face  mr miles again spoke uncertainly “you know thenyoud been told” she stared  him “i dont know what you mean i want  go  her” mr miles  examining her thoughtfully she fancied she saw  change  his expression   blood rushed  her forehead “i just want  go  her” she repeated he laid his hand  her arm “my child your mother  dying liff hyatt came down  fetch me get   come  us” he helped her up   seat  his side liff hyatt clambered    back  they drove off toward hamblin at first charity had hardly grasped what mr miles  saying  physical relief  finding herself seated   buggy  securely  her road   mountain effaced  impression  his words but  her head cleared she began  understand she knew  mountain had but  most infrequent intercourse   valleys she had often enough heard  said  no one ever went up there except  minister when someone  dying and now   her mother who  dying  she would find herself  much alone   mountain  anywhere else   world the sense  unescapable isolation  all she could feel   moment then she began  wonder   strangeness   being mr miles who had undertaken  perform this grim errand he did not seem   least like  kind  man who would care  go up  mountain but here    her side guiding  horse   firm hand  bending  her  kindly gleam  his spectacles  if there  nothing unusual  their being together  such circumstances for  while she found  impossible  speak   seemed  understand this  made no attempt  question her but presently she felt her tears rise  flow down over her drawn cheeks   must have seen them too   laid his hand  hers  said   low voice “wont you tell me what  troubling you” she shook her head   did not insist but after  while  said   same low tone so  they should not  overheard “charity what do you know  your childhood before you came down  north dormer” she controlled herself  answered “nothing only what i heard mr royall say one day he said  brought me down because my father went  prison” “and youve never been up there since” “never” mr miles  silent again then  said “im glad youre coming  me now perhaps we may find your mother alive  she may know  you have come” they had reached hamblin where  snowflurry had left white patches   rough grass   roadside    angles   roofs facing north it   poor bleak village under  granite flank   mountain   soon  they left  they began  climb the road  steep  full  ruts   horse settled down   walk while they mounted  mounted  world dropping away below them  great mottled stretches  forest  field  stormy dark blue distances charity had often had visions  this ascent   mountain but she had not known  would reveal so wide  country   sight  those strange lands reaching away  every side gave her  new sense  harneys remoteness she knew  must  miles  miles beyond  last range  hills  seemed    outmost verge  things  she wondered how she had ever dreamed  going  new york  find him as  road mounted  country grew bleaker  they drove across fields  faded mountain grass bleached  long months beneath  snow in  hollows  few white birches trembled or  mountain ash lit  scarlet clusters but only  scant growth  pines darkened  granite ledges the wind  blowing fiercely across  open slopes  horse faced   bent head  straining flanks  now  then  buggy swayed so  charity had  clutch  side mr miles had not spoken again  seemed  understand  she wanted   left alone after  while  track they  following forked   pulled up  horse  if uncertain   way liff hyatt craned his head around   back  shouted against  wind “left”  they turned into  stunted pinewood  began  drive down  other side   mountain a mile or two farther  they came out   clearing where two or three low houses lay  stony fields crouching among  rocks  if  brace themselves against  wind they  hardly more than sheds built  logs  rough boards  tin stovepipes sticking out  their roofs the sun  setting  dusk had already fallen   lower world but  yellow glare still lay   lonely hillside   crouching houses the next moment  faded  left  landscape  dark autumn twilight “over there” liff called out stretching his long arm over mr miless shoulder the clergyman turned   left across  bit  bare ground overgrown  docks  nettles  stopped before  most ruinous   sheds a stovepipe reached  crooked arm out  one window   broken panes   other  stuffed  rags  paper in contrast  such  dwelling  brown house   swamp might have stood   home  plenty as  buggy drew up two or three mongrel dogs jumped out   twilight   great barking   young man slouched   door  stood there staring in  twilight charity saw  his face had  same sodden look  bash hyatts  day she had seen him sleeping   stove he made no effort  silence  dogs but leaned   door  if roused   drunken lethargy while mr miles got out   buggy “is  here”  clergyman asked liff   low voice  liff nodded mr miles turned  charity “just hold  horse  minute my dear ill go  first”  said putting  reins  her hands she took them passively  sat staring straight ahead  her   darkening scene while mr miles  liff hyatt went up   house they stood  few minutes talking   man   door  then mr miles came back as  came close charity saw  his smooth pink face wore  frightened solemn look “your mother  dead charity youd better come  me”  said she got down  followed him while liff led  horse away as she approached  door she said  herself “this  where i  born this  where i belong” she had said   herself often enough  she looked across  sunlit valleys   mountain but  had meant nothing then  now  had become  reality mr miles took her gently   arm  they entered what appeared    only room   house it  so dark  she could just discern  group   dozen people sitting or sprawling about  table made  boards laid across two barrels they looked up listlessly  mr miles  charity came in   womans thick voice said “heres  preacher” but no one moved mr miles paused  looked about him then  turned   young man who had met them   door “is  body here”  asked the young man instead  answering turned his head toward  group “wheres  candle i tole yer  bring  candle”  said  sudden harshness   girl who  lolling against  table she did not answer but another man got up  took  some corner  candle stuck into  bottle “howll i light it the stoves out”  girl grumbled mr miles fumbled under his heavy wrappings  drew out  matchbox he held  match   candle    moment or two  faint circle  light fell   pale aguish heads  started out   shadow like  heads  nocturnal animals “marys over there” someone said  mr miles taking  bottle  his hand passed behind  table charity followed him  they stood before  mattress   floor   corner   room a woman lay  it but she did not look like  dead woman she seemed  have fallen across her squalid bed   drunken sleep   have been left lying where she fell  her ragged disordered clothes one arm  flung above her head one leg drawn up under  torn skirt  left  other bare   knee  swollen glistening leg   ragged stocking rolled down about  ankle the woman lay  her back her eyes staring up unblinkingly   candle  trembled  mr miless hand “she jus dropped off”  woman said over  shoulder   others   young man added “i jus come   found her” an elderly man  lank hair   feeble grin pushed between them “it  like this i says  her ony  night before if you dont take  quit i says  her” someone pulled him back  sent him reeling against  bench along  wall where  dropped down muttering his unheeded narrative there   silence then  young woman who had been lolling against  table suddenly parted  group  stood  front  charity she  healthier  robuster looking than  others  her weatherbeaten face had  certain sullen beauty “whos  girl who brought her here” she said fixing her eyes mistrustfully   young man who had rebuked her  not having  candle ready mr miles spoke “i brought her she  mary hyatts daughter” “what her too”  girl sneered   young man turned  her   oath “shut your mouth damn you or get out  here”  said then  relapsed into his former apathy  dropped down   bench leaning his head against  wall mr miles had set  candle   floor  taken off his heavy coat he turned  charity “come  help me”  said he knelt down   mattress  pressed  lids over  dead womans eyes charity trembling  sick knelt beside him  tried  compose her mothers body she drew  stocking over  dreadful glistening leg  pulled  skirt down   battered upturned boots as she did so she looked  her mothers face thin yet swollen  lips parted   frozen gasp above  broken teeth there  no sign    anything human she lay there like  dead dog   ditch charitys hands grew cold  they touched her mr miles drew  womans arms across her breast  laid his coat over her then  covered her face  his handkerchief  placed  bottle   candle    her head having done this  stood up “is there no coffin”  asked turning   group behind him there   moment  bewildered silence then  fierce girl spoke up “youd oughter brought   you whered we get one here id like ter know” mr miles looking   others repeated “is  possible you have no coffin ready” “thats what i say them    sleeps better”  old woman murmured “but then she never had no bed” “and  stove warnt hers” said  lankhaired man   defensive mr miles turned away  them  moved  few steps apart he had drawn  book  his pocket  after  pause  opened   began  read holding  book  arms length  low down so   pages caught  feeble light charity had remained  her knees   mattress now  her mothers face  covered   easier  stay near her  avoid  sight   living faces which too horribly showed  what stages hers had lapsed into death “i am  resurrection   life” mr miles began “he  believeth  me though   dead yet shall  live though after my skin worms destroy my body yet  my flesh shall i see god” in my flesh shall i see god charity thought   gaping mouth  stony eyes under  handkerchief    glistening leg over which she had drawn  stocking “we brought nothing into this world  we shall take nothing out  it” there   sudden muttering   scuffle   back   group “i brought  stove” said  elderly man  lank hair pushing his way between  others “i wen down  crestonn bought it n i got  right  take  outer here n ill lick any feller says i aint” “sit down damn you” shouted  tall youth who had been drowsing   bench against  wall “for man walketh   vain shadow  disquieteth himself  vain  heapeth up riches  cannot tell who shall gather them” “well  are his”  woman   background interjected   frightened whine the tall youth staggered  his feet “if you dont hold your mouths ill turn you all out o here  whole lot  you”  cried  many oaths “gwan minister dont let em faze you” “now  christ risen   dead  become  firstfruits  them  slept behold i show you  mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all  changed   moment   twinkling   eye   last trump for this corruptible must put  incorruption  this mortal must put  immortality so when this corruption shall have put  incorruption  when this mortal shall have put  immortality then shall  brought  pass  saying   written death  swallowed up  victory” one  one  mighty words fell  charitys bowed head soothing  horror subduing  tumult mastering her  they mastered  drinkdazed creatures  her back mr miles read   last word  then closed  book “is  grave ready”  asked liff hyatt who had come  while   reading nodded  “yes”  pushed forward   side   mattress the young man   bench who seemed  assert some sort  right  kinship   dead woman got  his feet again   proprietor   stove joined him between them they raised up  mattress but their movements  unsteady   coat slipped   floor revealing  poor body   helpless misery charity picking up  coat covered her mother once more liff had brought  lantern   old woman who had already spoken took  up  opened  door  let  little procession pass out the wind had dropped   night  very dark  bitterly cold the old woman walked ahead  lantern shaking  her hand  spreading out before her  pale patch  dead grass  coarseleaved weeds enclosed   immensity  blackness mr miles took charity   arm  side  side they walked behind  mattress at length  old woman   lantern stopped  charity saw  light fall   stooping shoulders   bearers    ridge  upheaved earth over which they  bending mr miles released her arm  approached  hollow   other side   ridge  while  men stooped down lowering  mattress into  grave  began  speak again “man   born  woman hath but  short time  live   full  misery he cometh up   cut down  fleeth     shadow yet o lord god most holy o lord most mighty o holy  merciful saviour deliver us not into  bitter pains  eternal death” “easy there  she down” piped  claimant   stove   young man called over his shoulder “lift  light there cant you” there   pause during which  light floated uncertainly over  open grave someone bent over  pulled out mr miless coat“no noleave  handkerchief”  interposedand then liff hyatt coming forward   spade began  shovel   earth “forasmuch   hath pleased almighty god  his great mercy  take unto himself  soul  our dear sister here departed we therefore commit her body   ground earth  earth ashes  ashes dust  dust” liffs gaunt shoulders rose  bent   lantern light   dashed  clods  earth into  grave “godits froze aready”  muttered spitting into his palm  passing his ragged shirtsleeve across his perspiring face “through our lord jesus christ who shall change our vile body   may  like unto his glorious body according   mighty working whereby he  able  subdue all things unto himself” the last spadeful  earth fell   vile body  mary hyatt  liff rested  his spade his shoulder blades still heaving   effort “lord have mercy upon us christ have mercy upon us lord have mercy upon us” mr miles took  lantern   old womans hand  swept  light across  circle  bleared faces “now kneel down all  you”  commanded   voice  authority  charity had never heard she knelt down   edge   grave   others stiffly  hesitatingly got  their knees beside her mr miles knelt too “and now pray  meyou know this prayer”  said   began “our father which art  heaven” one or two   women falteringly took  words up  when

up  charity who had remained passively kneeling   rough mound  earth “my child you must come its very late” she lifted her eyes  his face  seemed  speak out  another world “i aint coming im going  stay here” “here where what do you mean” “these  my folks im going  stay  them” mr miles lowered his voice “but its not possibleyou dont know what you  doing you cant stay among these people you must

saidrolled up against her like sleeping puppies they had their thin clothes spread over them having given  only other blanket  their guest through  small square  glass   opposite wall charity saw  deep funnel  sky so black so remote so palpitating  frosty stars  her very soul seemed   sucked into it up there somewhere she supposed  god whom mr miles had invoked  waiting  mary hyatt  appear what  long flight  was and what would she have  say when she reached him charitys bewildered brain laboured   attempt  picture her mothers past   relate   any way   designs   just but merciful god but   impossible  imagine any link between them she herself felt  remote   poor creature she had seen lowered into her hastily dug grave  if  height   heavens divided them she had seen poverty  misfortune  her life but   community where poor thrifty mrs hawes   industrious ally represented  nearest approach  destitution there  nothing  suggest  savage misery   mountain farmers as she lay there halfstunned  her tragic initiation charity vainly tried  think herself into  life about her but she could not even make out what relationship these people bore  each other or  her dead mother they seemed   herded together   sort  passive promiscuity  which their common misery   strongest link she tried  picture  herself what her life would have been if she had grown up   mountain running wild  rags sleeping   floor curled up against her mother like  palefaced children huddled against old mrs hyatt  turning into  fierce bewildered creature like  girl who had apostrophized her  such strange words she  frightened   secret affinity she had felt  this girl    light  threw  her own beginnings then she remembered what mr royall had said  telling her story  lucius harney “yes there   mother but she  glad  have  child go shed have given her  anybody” well after all  her mother so much  blame charity since  day had always thought  her  destitute  all human feeling now she seemed merely pitiful what mother would not want  save her child  such  life charity thought   future  her own child  tears welled into her aching eyes  ran down over her face if she had been less exhausted less burdened  his weight she would have sprung up then  there  fled away the grim hours   night dragged themselves slowly by   last  sky paled  dawn threw  cold blue beam into  room she lay  her corner staring   dirty floor  clothesline hung  decaying rags  old woman huddled against  cold stove   light gradually spreading across  wintry world  bringing    new day  which she would have  live  choose  act  make herself  place among these peopleor  go back   life she had left a mortal lassitude weighed  her there  moments when she felt  all she asked   go  lying there unnoticed then her mind revolted   thought  becoming one   miserable herd  which she sprang   seemed  though  save her child  such  fate she would find strength  travel any distance  bear any burden life might put  her vague thoughts  nettleton flitted through her mind she said  herself  she would find some quiet place where she could bear her child  give   decent people  keep  then she would go out like julia hawes  earn  living  hers she knew  girls   kind sometimes made enough  have their children nicely cared for  every other consideration disappeared   vision  her baby cleaned  combed  rosy  hidden away somewhere where she could run   kiss it  bring  pretty things  wear anything anything  better than  add another life   nest  misery   mountain the old woman   children  still sleeping when charity rose  her mattress her body  stiff  cold  fatigue  she moved slowly lest her heavy steps should rouse them she  faint  hunger  had nothing left  her satchel but   table she saw  half   stale loaf no doubt    serve   breakfast  old mrs hyatt   children but charity did not care she had her own baby  think of she broke off  piece   bread  ate  greedily then her glance fell   thin faces   sleeping children  filled  compunction she rummaged  her satchel  something  which  pay  what she had taken she found one   pretty chemises  ally had made  her   blue ribbon run through  edging it  one   dainty things

above  eastern shoulder   mountain the houses scattered   hillside lay cold  smokeless under  sunflecked clouds  not  human being   sight charity paused   threshold  tried  discover  road  which she had come  night before across  field surrounding mrs hyatts shanty she saw  tumbledown house  which she supposed  funeral service had taken place the trail ran across  ground between  two houses  disappeared   pinewood   flank   mountain   little way   right under  windbeaten thorn  mound  fresh earth made  dark spot   fawncoloured stubble charity walked across  field   ground as she approached  she heard  birds note   still air  looking up she saw  brown songsparrow perched   upper branch   thorn above  grave she stood  minute listening  his small solitary song then she rejoined  trail  began  mount  hill   pinewood thus far she had been impelled   blind instinct  flight but each step seemed  bring her nearer   realities  which her feverish vigil had given only  shadowy image now  she walked again   daylight world   way back  familiar things her imagination moved more soberly on one point she  still decided she could not remain  north dormer   sooner she got away    better but everything beyond  darkness as she continued  climb  air grew keener  when she passed   shelter   pines   open grassy roof   mountain  cold wind   night before sprang out  her she bent her shoulders  struggled  against    while but presently her breath failed  she sat down under  ledge  rock overhung  shivering birches from where she sat she saw  trail wandering across  bleached grass   direction  hamblin   granite wall   mountain falling away  infinite distances on  side   ridge  valleys still lay  wintry shadow but   plain beyond  sun  touching village roofs  steeples  gilding  haze  smoke over faroff invisible towns charity felt herself  mere speck   lonely circle   sky the events   last two days seemed  have divided her forever  her short dream  bliss even harneys image had been blurred   crushing experience she thought  him  so remote  her   seemed hardly more than  memory in her fagged  floating mind only one sensation had  weight  reality    bodily burden  her child but   she would have felt  rootless   whiffs  thistledown  wind blew past her her child  like  load  held her down  yet like  hand  pulled her  her feet she said  herself  she must get up

moment she recognized  heavy bulk   man who held  reins the buggy  following  trail  making straight   pinewood through which she had climbed  she knew  once   driver   search  her her first impulse   crouch down under  ledge till  had passed but  instinct  concealment  overruled   relief  feeling  someone  near her   awful emptiness she stood up  walked toward  buggy mr royall saw her  touched  horse   whip a minute or two later   abreast  charity their eyes met  without speaking  leaned over  helped her up into  buggy she tried  speak  stammer out some explanation but no words came  her    drew  cover over her knees  simply said “the minister told me hed left you up here so i come up  you” he turned  horses head  they began  jog back toward hamblin charity sat speechless staring straight ahead  her  mr royall occasionally uttered  word  encouragement   horse “get along there dan i gave him  rest  hamblin but i brought him along pretty quick  its  stiff pull up here against  wind” as  spoke  occurred  her   first time   reach  top   mountain so early  must have left north dormer   coldest hour   night  have travelled steadily but   halt  hamblin  she felt  softness  her heart which no act  his had ever produced since  had brought her  crimson rambler because she had given up boardingschool  stay  him after  interval  began again “it   day just like this only spitting snow when i come up here  you  first time” then  if fearing  she might take his remark   reminder  past benefits  added quickly “i dunnos you think   such  good job either” “yes i do” she murmured looking straight ahead  her “well”  said “i tried” he did not finish  sentence  she could think  nothing more  say “ho there dan step out”  muttered jerking  bridle “we aint home yetyou cold”  asked abruptly she shook her head but  drew  cover higher up  stooped  tuck   about  ankles she continued  look straight ahead tears  weariness  weakness  dimming her eyes  beginning  run over but she dared not wipe them away lest  should observe  gesture they drove  silence following  long loops   descent upon hamblin  mr royall did not speak again till they reached  outskirts   village then  let  reins

table a feeling  complete passiveness had once more come over her  she  conscious only   pleasant animal sensations  warmth  rest mrs hobart put bread  milk   table  then went out   house charity saw her leading  horse away   barn across  yard she did not come back  mr royall  charity sat alone   table   smoking coffee between them he poured out  cup  her  put  piece  bread   saucer  she began  eat as  warmth   coffee flowed through her veins her thoughts cleared  she began  feel like  living being again but  return  life  so painful   food choked  her throat  she sat staring down   table  silent anguish after  while mr royall pushed back his chair “now then”  said “if youre  mind  go along” she did not move   continued “we can pick up  noon train  nettleton if you say so” the words sent  blood rushing  her face  she raised her startled eyes  his he  standing   other side   table looking  her kindly  gravely  suddenly she understood what   going  say she continued  sit motionless  leaden weight upon her lips “you  me have spoke some hard things  each other  our time charity  theres no good  i can see  any more talking now but ill never feel any way but one about you  if you

cloak  had slipped  her chair  laid  about her shoulders she followed him out   house  then walked across  yard   shed where  horse  tied mr royall unblanketed him  led him out into  road charity got into  buggy   drew  cover about her  shook out  reins   cluck when they reached  end   village  turned  horses head toward creston xviii they began  jog down  winding road   valley  old dans languid pace charity felt herself sinking into deeper depths  weariness   they descended through  bare woods there  moments when she lost  exact sense  things  seemed   sitting beside her lover   leafy arch  summer bending over them but this illusion  faint  transitory for  most part she had only  confused sensation  slipping down  smooth irresistible current  she abandoned herself   feeling   refuge   torment  thought mr royall seldom spoke but his silent presence gave her   first time  sense  peace  security she knew  where   there would  warmth rest silence    moment they  all she wanted she shut her eyes  even these things grew dim  her in  train during  short run  creston  nettleton  warmth aroused her   consciousness  being under strange eyes gave her  momentary energy she sat upright

 lines   landscape   finely pencilled   december a few days  autumn cold had wiped out all trace   rich fields  languid groves through which she had passed   fourth  july    fading   landscape those fervid hours had faded too she could no longer believe  she   being who had lived them she  someone  whom something irreparable  overwhelming had happened but  traces   steps leading up   had almost vanished when  train reached nettleton  she walked out into  square  mr royalls side  sense  unreality grew more overpowering the physical strain   night  day had left no room  her mind  new sensations  she followed mr royall  passively   tired child as   confused dream she presently found herself sitting  him   pleasant room   table   red  white tablecloth  which hot food  tea  placed he filled her cup  plate  whenever she lifted her eyes  them she found his resting  her   same steady tranquil gaze  had reassured  strengthened her when they had faced each other  old mrs hobarts kitchen as everything else  her consciousness grew more  more confused  immaterial became more  more like  universal shimmer  dissolves  world  failing eyes mr royalls presence began  detach itself  rocky firmness  this elusive background she had always thought  himwhen she thought  him  allas  someone hateful  obstructive but whom she could outwit  dominate when she chose  make  effort only once   day   old home week celebration while  stray fragments  his address drifted across her troubled mind had she caught  glimpse  another being  being so different   dullwitted enemy  whom she had supposed herself   living  even through  burning mist  her own dreams  had stood out  startling distinctness for  moment then what  saidand something  his way  saying ithad made her see why  had always struck her  such  lonely man but  mist  her dreams had hidden him again  she had forgotten  fugitive impression it came back  her now  they sat   table  gave her through her own immeasurable

pleasantly  asked them   seated   few minutes while witnesses  being summoned charity sat down obediently  mr royall his hands behind his back paced slowly up  down  room as  turned  faced charity she noticed  his lips  twitching  little but  look  his eyes  grave  calm once  paused before her  said timidly “your hairs got kinder loose   wind”  she lifted her hands  tried  smooth back  locks  had

 her dazed mind there rose  memory  mr miles standing  night before   desolate house   mountain  reading out   same book words  had  same dread sound  finality “i require  charge you both  ye  answer   dreadful day  judgment when  secrets  all hearts shall  disclosed  if either  you know any impediment whereby ye may not  lawfully joined together” charity raised her eyes  met mr royalls they  still looking  her kindly  steadily “i will” she heard him say  moment later after another interval  words  she had failed  catch she  so busy trying  understand  gestures   clergyman  signalling  her  make  she no longer heard what  being said after another interval  lady   bench stood up  taking her hand put   mr royalls it lay enclosed  his strong palm  she felt  ring   too big  her being slipped  her
