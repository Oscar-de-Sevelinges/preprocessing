pilgrims progress from this world to that which is to come  john bunyan part one delivered under the similitude of a dream by john bunyan the authors apology  his book  when   first i took my pen  hand thus   write i did not understand that i  all should make  little book in such  mode nay i had undertook to make another which when almost done before i  aware i this begun and thus  was i writing   way and race  saints  this our gospel day fell suddenly into  allegory about their journey   way  glory in more than twenty things which i set down this done i twenty more had  my crown and they again began  multiply like sparks    coals  fire do fly nay then thought i if  you breed so fast ill put you  yourselves lest you  last should prove ad infinitum  eat out the book  i already am about well so i did but yet i did not think to shew  all  world my pen  ink in such  mode i only thought  make i knew not what nor did i undertake thereby  please my neighbour no not i i did  my own self  gratify  neither did i but vacant seasons spend in this my scribble nor did i intend but  divert myself  doing this from worser thoughts which make me do amiss thus i set pen  paper  delight and quickly had my thoughts  black  white for having now my method   end still  i pulled  came  so i penned it down until  came  last  be for length  breadth  bigness which you see well when i had thus put mine ends together i shewed them others  i might see whether they would condemn them or them justify and some said let them live some let them die some said john print it others said not so some said it might do good others said no now  i   strait  did not see which   best thing   done  me at last i thought since you  thus divided i print  will  so  case decided  for thought i some i see would have  done though others   channel do not run to prove then who advised   best thus i thought fit  put    test i further thought if now i did deny those  would have it thus  gratify i did not know but hinder them i might of  which would  them  great delight for those which  not   coming forth i said  them offend you i am loth yet since your brethren pleased   be forbear  judge till you do further see if  thou wilt not read let  alone some love  meat some love  pick  bone yea  i might them better palliate i did too  them thus expostulate  may i not write  such  style  this in such  method too  yet not miss my endthy good why may  not  done dark clouds bring waters when  bright bring none yea dark or bright if they their silver drops cause  descend  earth  yielding crops gives praise  both  carpeth not  either but treasures up  fruit they yield together yea so commixes both   her fruit none can distinguish this  that they suit her well when hungry but if she  full she spews out both  makes their blessings null you see  ways  fisherman doth take to catch  fish what engines doth  make behold how  engageth all his wits also his snares lines angles hooks  nets yet fish there be  neither hook nor line nor snare nor net nor engine can make thine they must  groped for   tickled too or they  not  catchd whateer you do how does  fowler seek  catch his game by divers means all which one cannot name his guns his nets his limetwigs light  bell he creeps  goes  stands yea who can tell of all his postures yet theres none  these will make him master  what fowls  please yea  must pipe  whistle  catch this yet if  does so  bird   miss if   pearl may   toads head dwell and may  found too   oystershell if things  promise nothing do contain what better  than gold who  disdain that have  inkling  it there  look that they may find it now my little book though void  all these paintings  may make it  this or  other man  take is not without those things  do excel what do  brave but empty notions dwell  well yet i am not fully satisfied that this your book  stand when soundly tried why whats  matter it  dark what though but   feigned what  that i trow some men  feigned words  dark  mine make truth  spangle   rays  shine but they want solidness speak man thy mind they drown  weak metaphors make us blind solidity indeed becomes  pen of him  writeth things divine  men but must i needs want solidness because by metaphors i speak were not gods laws his gospel laws  olden times held forth by types shadows  metaphors yet loth will any sober man   find fault with them lest   found   assault the highest wisdom no  rather stoops and seeks  find out what  pins  loops by calves  sheep  heifers   rams by birds  herbs    blood  lambs god speaketh  him  happy   that finds  light  grace   them be  be not too forward therefore  conclude that i want solidnessthat i am rude all things solid  show not solid be all things  parables despise not we lest things most hurtful lightly we receive and things  good are  our souls bereave my dark  cloudy words they do but hold the truth  cabinets enclose  gold the prophets used much  metaphors to set forth truth yea who so considers christ his apostles too shall plainly see that truths  this day  such mantles be am i afraid  say  holy writ which   style  phrase puts down all wit is everywhere so full  all these things dark figures allegories yet there springs from  same book  lustre  those rays of light  turn our darkest nights  days  come let my carper  his life now look and find there darker lines than  my book he findeth any yea  let him know that  his best things there  worse lines too may we but stand before impartial men to his poor one i dare adventure ten that they  take my meaning  these lines far better than his lies  silver shrines come truth although  swaddling clouts i find informs  judgement rectifies  mind pleases  understanding makes   submit  memory too  doth fill with what doth our imaginations please likewise  tends our troubles  appease sound words i know timothy   use and old wives fables    refuse but yet grave paul him nowhere did forbid the use  parables  which lay hid that gold those pearls  precious stones   worth digging for    greatest care let me add one word more o man  god art thou offended dost thou wish i had put forth my matter  another dress or  i had  things been more express three things let me propound then i submit to those   my betters   fit   i find not  i am denied  use of this my method so i no abuse put   words things readers or  rude in handling figure or similitude in application but all  i may seek  advance  truth this or  way denied did i say nay i have leave example too    them  have god better pleased  their words or ways than any man  breatheth nowadays thus  express my mind thus  declare things unto thee  excellentest are  i find  men as high  trees  write dialoguewise yet no man doth them slight for writing so indeed if they abuse truth cursed  they   craft they use to  intent but yet let truth  free to make her sallies upon thee  me which way  pleases god  who knows how better than   taught us first  plough to guide our mind  pens  his design and  makes base things usher  divine  i find  holy writ  many places hath semblance  this method where  cases do call  one thing  set forth another use  i may then  yet nothing smother truths golden beams nay  this method may make  cast forth  rays  light  day and now before i do put up my pen ill shew  profit  my book  then commit both thee   unto  hand that pulls  strong down  makes weak ones stand this book  chalketh out before thine eyes the man  seeks  everlasting prize it shews you whence  comes whither  goes what  leaves undone also what  does it also

similitude   dream  as i walked through  wilderness  this world i lighted   certain place where   den  i laid me down   place  sleep and  i slept i dreamed  dream i dreamed  behold i saw  man clothed

them  true but because they thought  some frenzy distemper had got into his head therefore  drawing towards night  they hoping  sleep might settle his brains  all haste they got him  bed but  night   troublesome  him   day wherefore instead  sleeping  spent   sighs  tears so when  morning  come they would know how  did he told them worse  worse  also set  talking  them again but they began   hardened they also thought  drive away his distemper  harsh  surly carriages  him sometimes they would deride sometimes they would chide  sometimes they would quite neglect him wherefore  began  retire himself  his chamber  pray   pity them  also  condole his own misery  would also walk solitarily   fields sometimes reading  sometimes praying  thus  some days  spent his time  now i saw upon  time when   walking   fields   was    wont reading  his book  greatly distressed  his mind and   read  burst out   had done before crying what shall i do   saved  i saw also   looked this way   way

freely pli well my good companion glad am i  hear  these things come on let us mend our pace chr i cannot go so fast  i would  reason  this burden    my back  now i saw  my dream  just  they had ended this talk they drew near   very miry slough     midst   plain  they being heedless did both fall suddenly into  bog the name   slough  despond here therefore they wallowed   time being grievously bedaubed   dirt  christian because   burden    his back began  sink   mire  pli then said pliable ah neighbour christian where  you now chr truly said christian i do not know pli at this pliable began   offended  angrily said  his fellow is this  happiness you have told me all this while of if we have such ill speed  our first setting out what may we expect betwixt this  our journeys end may i get out again  my life you shall possess  brave country alone  me and  that  gave  desperate struggle or two  got out   mire   side   slough which  next  his own house so away  went  christian saw him no more  wherefore christian  left  tumble   slough  despond alone but still  endeavoured  struggle   side   slough   still further  his own house  next   wicketgate  which  did but could not get out because   burden   upon his back but i beheld  my dream   man came  him whose name  help  asked him what  did there chr sir said christian i  bid go this way   man called evangelist who directed me also  yonder gate  i might escape  wrath  come   i  going thither i fell  here  help but why did not you look   steps chr fear followed me so hard  i fled  next way  fell in help then said he give me thy hand so  gave him his hand   drew him out  set him upon sound ground  bid him go  his way ps   then i stepped  him  plucked him out  said sir wherefore since over this place   way   city  destruction  yonder gate    this plat  not mended  poor travellers might go thither  more security and  said unto me this miry slough  such  place  cannot  mended    descent whither  scum  filth  attends conviction  sin doth continually run  therefore   called  slough  despond  still   sinner  awakened about his lost condition there ariseth  his soul many fears  doubts  discouraging apprehensions which all  them get together  settle  this place and this   reason   badness  this ground  it  not  pleasure   king  this place should remain so bad isa  his labourers also have   direction  his majestys surveyors been  above these sixteen hundred years employed about this patch  ground if perhaps  might have been mended yea   my knowledge said he here have been swallowed up  least twenty thousand cartloads yea millions  wholesome instructions  have  all seasons been brought  all places   kings dominions  they  can tell say they   best materials  make good ground   place if so be  might have been mended but    slough  despond still  so   when they have done what they can  true there are   direction   lawgiver certain good  substantial steps placed even through  very midst  this slough but  such time  this place doth much spew out  filth   doth against change  weather these steps  hardly seen or if they be men through  dizziness  their heads step beside  then they  bemired  purpose notwithstanding  steps  there but  ground  good when they  once got    gate  sam   now i saw  my dream   this time pliable  got home  his house again so  his neighbours came  visit him  some  them called him wise man  coming back  some called him fool  hazarding himself  christian others again did mock  his cowardliness saying surely since you began  venture i would not have been so base  have given out   few difficulties so pliable sat sneaking among them but  last  got more confidence  then they all turned their tales  began  deride poor christian behind his back and thus much concerning pliable  now  christian  walking solitarily  himself  espied one afar off come crossing over  field  meet him  their hap   meet just  they  crossing  way  each other the gentlemans name  met him  mr worldly wiseman  dwelt   town  carnal policy  very great town  also hard   whence christian came this man then meeting  christian  having some inkling  himfor christians setting forth   city  destruction  much noised abroad not only   town where  dwelt but also  began    town talk  some other placesmr worldly wiseman therefore having some guess  him  beholding his laborious going  observing his sighs  groans   like began thus  enter into some talk  christian  world how now good fellow whither away after this burdened manner chr a burdened manner indeed  ever i think poor creature had and whereas you ask me whither away i tell you sir i am going  yonder wicketgate before me  there  i am informed i shall  put into  way   rid  my heavy burden world hast thou  wife  children chr yes but i am so laden  this burden  i cannot take  pleasure  them  formerly methinks i am  if i had none  cor  world wilt thou hearken unto me if i give thee counsel chr if   good i

wearisomeness painfulness hunger perils nakedness sword lions dragons darkness and   word death  what not these things  certainly true having been confirmed  many testimonies and why should  man so carelessly cast away himself  giving heed   stranger chr why sir this burden upon my back  more terrible  me than all these things which you have mentioned nay methinks i care not what i meet    way if so  i can also meet  deliverance  my burden  world how camest thou   burden  first chr by reading this book  my hand world i thought so    happened unto thee   other weak men who meddling  things

i know what i would obtain   ease  my heavy burden  world but why wilt thou seek  ease this way seeing so many dangers attend it especially since hadst thou but patience  hear me i could direct thee   obtaining  what thou desirest without  dangers  thou  this way wilt run thyself into yea   remedy   hand besides i  add  instead  those dangers thou shalt meet  much safety friendship  content chr

honest mans house world do you see yonder hill chr yes very well world by  hill you must go   first house you come   his  so christian turned out  his way  go  mr legalitys house  help but behold when   got now hard   hill  seemed so high  also  side     next  wayside did hang so much over  christian  afraid  venture further lest  hill should fall  his head wherefore there  stood still  wotted not what  do also his burden now seemed heavier  him than while    his way there came also flashes  fire out   hill  made christian afraid   should  burned ex   here therefore  sweat  did quake  fear heb  when christians unto carnal men give ear out  their way they go  pay  t dear for master worldly wiseman can but shew a saint  way  bondage   woe  and now  began   sorry   had taken mr worldly wisemans counsel and    saw evangelist coming  meet him   sight also  whom  began  blush  shame so evangelist drew nearer  nearer  coming up  him  looked upon him   severe  dreadful countenance  thus began  reason  christian  evan what dost thou here christian said he  which words christian knew not what  answer wherefore  present  stood speechless before him then said evangelist further art not thou  man  i found crying without  walls   city  destruction chr yes dear sir i am  man evan did not i direct thee  way   little wicketgate chr yes dear sir said christian evan how  it then  thou art so quickly turned aside  thou art now out   way  chr i met   gentleman so soon  i had got over  slough  despond who persuaded me  i might   village before me find  man  would take off my burden evan what  he chr he looked like  gentleman  talked much  me  got me  last  yield so i came hither but when i beheld this hill  how  hangs over  way i suddenly made  stand lest  should fall  my head evan what said  gentleman  you chr why  asked me whither i  going  i told him evan and what said  then chr he asked me if i had  family and i told him but said i i am so loaden   burden    my back  i cannot

off these burdens so i believed him  turned out   way into this if haply i might  soon eased  my burden but when i came  this place  beheld things  they are i stopped  fear as i said  danger but i now know not what  do  evan then said evangelist stand still  little  i may show thee  words  god so  stood trembling then said evangelist see  ye refuse not him  speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him  spake  earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away  him  speaketh  heaven heb  he said moreover now  just shall live  faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure  him heb  he also did thus apply them thou art  man  art running into this misery thou hast begun  reject  counsel   most high   draw back thy foot   way  peace even almost   hazarding  thy perdition  then christian fell down  his feet  dead crying woe  me  i am undone at  sight  which evangelist caught him   right hand saying all manner  sin  blasphemies shall  forgiven unto men matt  mark  be not faithless but believing john  then did christian again  little revive  stood up trembling   first before evangelist  then evangelist proceeded saying give more earnest heed   things  i shall tell thee of i  now show thee who    deluded thee  who   also  whom  sent thee the man  met thee  one worldly wiseman  rightly   so called partly because  savoureth only  doctrine  this world  john  therefore  always goes   town  morality  church  partly because  loveth  doctrine best   saveth him best   cross gal  and because    this carnal temper therefore  seeketh  pervert my ways though right now there  three things  this mans counsel  thou must utterly abhor  his turning thee out   way  his labouring  render  cross odious  thee and  his setting thy feet   way  leadeth unto  administration  death  first thou must abhor his turning thee out   way  thine own consenting thereunto because this   reject  counsel  god   sake   counsel   worldly wiseman the lord says strive  enter    strait gate luke   gate  which i sent thee  strait   gate  leadeth unto life  few there   find it matt  from this little wicketgate    way thereto hath this wicked man turned thee   bringing  thee almost  destruction hate therefore his turning thee out   way  abhor thyself  hearkening  him  secondly thou must abhor his labouring  render  cross odious unto thee  thou art  prefer  before  treasures  egypt heb  besides  king  glory hath told thee    will save his life shall lose it mark  john  matt  and he  cometh after me  hateth not his father  mother  wife  children  brethren  sisters yea  his own life also  cannot  my disciple luke  i say therefore  man  labour  persuade thee   shall  thy death without which the truth hath said thou canst not have eternal life this doctrine thou must abhor  thirdly thou must hate his setting  thy feet   way  leadeth   ministration  death and  this thou must consider  whom  sent thee  also how unable  person   deliver thee  thy burden  he  whom thou wast sent  ease being  name legality   son   bondwoman which now is    bondage  her children gal   is   mystery this mount sinai which thou hast feared  fall  thy head now if she  her children   bondage how canst thou expect  them   made free this legality therefore  not able  set thee free  thy burden no man   yet ever rid  his burden  him no nor ever  like  be ye cannot  justified   works   law    deeds   law no man living can  rid  his burden therefore mr worldly wiseman   alien  mr legality   cheat   his son civility notwithstanding his simpering looks   but  hypocrite  cannot help thee believe me there  nothing  all this noise  thou hast heard  these sottish men but  design  beguile thee  thy salvation  turning thee   way  which i had set thee after this evangelist called aloud   heavens  confirmation  what  had said    there came words  fire out   mountain under which poor christian stood  made  hair  his flesh stand up the words  thus pronounced as many     works   law  under  curse    written cursed  every one  continueth not  all things which  written   book   law  do them gal   now christian looked  nothing but death  began  cry out lamentably even cursing  time  which  met  mr worldly wiseman still calling himself  thousand fools  hearkening  his counsel  also  greatly ashamed  think  this gentlemans arguments flowing only   flesh should have  prevalency  him   cause him  forsake  right way this done  applied himself again  evangelist  words  sense  follow  chr sir what think you is there hope may i now go back  go up   wicketgate shall i not  abandoned  this  sent back  thence ashamed i am sorry i have hearkened  this mans counsel but may my sin  forgiven evan then said evangelist  him thy sin  very great    thou hast committed two evils thou hast forsaken  way   good  tread  forbidden paths yet   man   gate receive thee    goodwill  men only said he take heed  thou turn not aside again lest thou perish   way when his wrath  kindled but  little ps  then did christian address himself  go back  evangelist after  had kissed him gave him one smile  bid him godspeed so  went   haste neither spake   any man   way nor if any asked him would  vouchsafe them  answer he went like one   all  while treading  forbidden ground  could  no means think himself safe till again   got into  way which  left  follow mr worldly wisemans counsel so  process  time christian got up   gate now over  gate there  written knock   shall  opened unto you matt   he   enter  must first without stand knocking   gate nor need  doubt that  a knocker but  enter in for god can love him  forgive his sin he knocked therefore more than once or twice saying may i now enter here will  within open  sorry me though i have been an undeserving rebel then shall i not fail  sing his lasting praise  high at last there came  grave person   gate named goodwill who asked who  there  whence  came  what  would have  chr here   poor burdened sinner i come   city  destruction but am going  mount zion  i may  delivered   wrath  come i would therefore sir since i am informed   this gate   way thither know if you  willing  let me in goodwill i am willing  all my heart said he     opened  gate  so when christian  stepping in  other gave him  pull then said christian what means that the other told him a little distance  this gate there  erected  strong castle  which beelzebub   captain  thence both   them    him shoot arrows  those  come up  this gate if haply they may die before they can enter in then said christian i rejoice  tremble so when   got in  man   gate asked him who directed him thither  chr evangelist bid me come hither  knock as i did   said  you sir would tell me what i must do goodwill an open door  set before thee  no man can shut it chr now i begin  reap  benefits  my hazards goodwill but how    you came alone chr because none  my neighbours saw their danger  i saw mine goodwill did any  them know  your coming chr yes my wife  children saw me   first  called after me  turn again also some  my neighbours stood crying  calling after me  return but i put my fingers  my ears  so came  my way goodwill but did none  them follow you  persuade you  go back chr yes both obstinate  pliable but when they saw  they could not prevail obstinate went railing back but pliable came  me  little way goodwill but why did  not come through  chr we indeed came both together until we came   slough  despond into  which we also suddenly fell and then  my neighbour pliable discouraged  would not venture further wherefore getting out again   side next  his own house  told me i should possess  brave country alone  him so  went his way  i came minehe after obstinate  i  this gate goodwill then said goodwill alas poor man   celestial glory  so small esteem  him   counteth  not worth running  hazards   few difficulties  obtain it  chr truly said christian i have said  truth  pliable  if i should also say all  truth  myself   appear there  no betterment betwixt him  myself it  true  went back  his own house but i also turned aside  go   way  death being persuaded thereto   carnal arguments  one mr worldly wiseman goodwill oh did  light upon you what  would have had you  sought  ease   hands  mr legality they are both  them  very cheat but did you take his counsel chr yes  far  i durst i went  find out mr legality until i thought   mountain  stands  his house would have fallen upon my head wherefore there i  forced  stop goodwill that mountain  been  death  many     death  many more   well you escaped being   dashed  pieces chr why truly i do not know what had become  me there had not evangelist happily met me again  i  musing   midst  my dumps but   gods mercy   came  me again  else i had never come hither but now i am come such  one  i am more fit indeed  death   mountain than thus  stand talking  my lord but oh what  favour  this  me  yet i am admitted entrance here  goodwill we make no objections against any notwithstanding all  they have done before they came hither they   no wise cast out john vi  therefore good christian come  little way  me  i  teach thee about  way thou must go look before thee dost thou see this narrow way that   way thou must go   cast up   patriarchs prophets christ  his apostles     straight   rule can make it this   way thou must go  chr but said christian  there no turnings or windings  which  stranger may lose his way goodwill yes there  many ways butt down upon this  they  crooked  wide but thus thou mayest distinguish  right   wrong  right only being straight  narrow matt   then i saw  my dream  christian asked him further if  could not help him off  his burden   upon his back   yet  had not got rid thereof nor could   any means get  off without help he told him as  thy burden  content  bear it until thou comest   place  deliverance  there   fall  thy back  itself  then christian began  gird up his loins   address himself  his journey so  other told him that     gone some distance   gate  would come   house   interpreter  whose door  should knock   would show him excellent things then christian took his leave  his friend   again bid him godspeed  then  went  till  came   house   interpreter where  knocked over  over  last one came   door  asked who  there  chr sir here   traveller who  bid   acquaintance   goodman  this house  call here  my profit i would therefore speak   master   house so  called   master   house who after  little time came  christian  asked him what  would have chr sir said christian i am  man  am come   city  destruction  am going   mount zion  i  told   man  stands   gate   head  this way  if i called here you would show me excellent things such  would   help  me  my journey  inter then said  interpreter come in i  show  which   profitable  thee so  commanded his man  light  candle  bid christian follow him so  had him into  private room  bid his man open  door  which when  had done christian saw  picture   very grave person hang up against  wall  this   fashion  it it had eyes lifted up  heaven  best  books  his hand  law  truth  written upon his lips  world  behind his back it stood  if  pleaded  men   crown  gold did hang over his head chr then said christian what meaneth this  inter the man whose picture this is  one   thousand  can beget children  cor  travail  birth  children gal   nurse them himself when they  born and whereas thou seest him  his eyes lift up  heaven  best  books  his hand   law  truth writ  his lips    show thee  his work   know  unfold dark things  sinners even  also thou seest him stand  if  pleaded  men  whereas thou seest  world  cast behind him    crown hangs over his head    show thee  slighting  despising  things   present   love   hath  his masters service   sure   world  comes next  have glory  his reward now said  interpreter i have showed thee this picture first because  man whose picture this is   only man whom  lord   place whither thou art going hath authorised   thy guide  all difficult places thou mayest meet    way wherefore take good heed  what i have shewed thee  bear well  thy mind what thou hast seen lest  thy journey thou meet  some  pretend  lead thee right but their way goes down  death  then  took him   hand  led him into  very large parlour   full  dust because never swept  which after  had reviewed  little while  interpreter called   man  sweep now when  began  sweep  dust began so abundantly  fly about  christian had almost therewith been choked then said  interpreter   damsel  stood by bring hither  water  sprinkle  room  which when she had done   swept  cleansed  pleasure  chr then said christian what means this inter the interpreter answered this parlour   heart   man   never sanctified   sweet grace   gospel  dust  his original sin  inward corruptions  have defiled  whole man he  began  sweep  first   law but she  brought water  did sprinkle it   gospel now whereas thou sawest  so soon   first began  sweep  dust did so fly about   room  him could not  cleansed but  thou wast almost choked therewith this   shew thee   law instead  cleansing  heart by  working  sin doth revive put strength into  increase    soul even   doth discover  forbid it   doth not give power  subdue rom   cor  rom   again  thou sawest  damsel sprinkle  room  water upon which   cleansed  pleasure this   show thee  when  gospel comes   sweet  precious influences thereof   heart then i say even  thou sawest  damsel lay  dust  sprinkling  floor  water so  sin vanquished  subdued   soul made clean through  faith  it  consequently fit   king  glory  inhabit john  eph  acts  rom  john   i saw moreover  my dream   interpreter took him   hand  had him into  little room where sat two little children each one  his chair the name   eldest  passion   name   other patience passion seemed   much discontented but patience  very quiet then christian asked what   reason   discontent  passion the interpreter answered the governor  them would have him stay  his best things till  beginning   next year but   have all now but patience  willing  wait then i saw  one came  passion  brought him  bag  treasure  poured  down  his feet  which  took up  rejoiced therein  withal laughed patience  scorn but i beheld but  while   had lavished all away  had nothing left him but rags  chr then said christian   interpreter expound this matter more fully  me inter so  said these two lads  figures passion   men  this world  patience   men   which   come   here thou seest passion  have all now this year    say  this world so   men  this world they must have all their good things now they cannot stay till next year   until  next world  their portion  good that proverb a bird   hand  worth two   bush   more authority  them than  all  divine testimonies   good   world  come but  thou sawest   had quickly lavished all away  had presently left him nothing but rags so     all such men   end  this world chr then said christian now i see  patience   best wisdom   upon many accounts first because  stays   best things second  also because   have  glory  his when  other  nothing but rags  inter nay you may add another  wit  glory   next world  never wear out but these  suddenly gone therefore passion had not so much reason  laugh  patience because  had his good things first  patience  have  laugh  passion because  had his best things last  first must give place  last because last must have his time  come but last gives place  nothing  there  not another  succeed he therefore  hath his portion first must needs have  time  spend it but   hath his portion last must have  lastingly therefore   said  dives thou  thy lifetime receivedst thy good things  likewise lazarus evil things but now   comforted  thou art tormented luke  chr then i perceive   not best  covet things   now but  wait  things  come inter you say  truth for  things which  seen  temporal but  things which  not seen  eternal  cor  but though this  so yet since things present  our fleshly appetite  such near neighbours one  another  again because things  come  carnal sense  such strangers one  another therefore  is   first  these so suddenly fall into amity   distance  so continued between  second  then i saw  my dream   interpreter took christian   hand  led him into  place where   fire burning against  wall  one standing  it always casting much water upon it  quench it yet did  fire burn higher  hotter then said christian what means this  the interpreter answered this fire   work  grace   wrought   heart   casts water upon it  extinguish  put  out   devil but   thou seest  fire notwithstanding burn higher  hotter thou shalt also see  reason  that so  had him about   backside   wall where  saw  man   vessel  oil  his hand   which  did also continually cast but secretly into  fire then said christian what means this  the interpreter answered this  christ who continually   oil  his grace maintains  work already begun   heart   means  which notwithstanding what  devil can do  souls  his people prove gracious still  cor  and   thou sawest   man stood behind  wall  maintain  fire    teach thee    hard   tempted  see how this work  grace  maintained   soul i saw also   interpreter took him again   hand  led him into  pleasant place where  builded  stately palace beautiful  behold   sight  which christian  greatly delighted he saw also upon  top thereof certain persons walking who  clothed all  gold then said christian may we go  thither  then  interpreter took him  led him up towards  door   palace  behold   door stood  great company  men  desirous  go in but durst not there also sat  man   little distance   door   tableside   book  his inkhorn before him  take  name  him  should enter therein  saw also    doorway stood many men  armour  keep it being resolved  do  men  would enter what hurt  mischief they could now  christian somewhat  amaze at last when every man started back  fear   armed men christian saw  man   very stout countenance come up   man  sat there  write saying set down my name sir  which when  had done  saw  man draw his sword  put  helmet upon his head  rush toward  door upon  armed men who laid upon him  deadly force but  man not  all discouraged fell  cutting  hacking most fiercely so after  had received  given many wounds  those  attempted  keep him out  cut his way through them all acts   pressed forward into  palace  which there   pleasant voice heard  those   within even  those  walked upon  top   palace saying come in come in eternal glory thou shalt win so  went in   clothed  such garments  they then christian smiled  said i think verily i know  meaning  this  now said christian let me go hence nay stay said  interpreter till i have shewed thee  little more  after  thou shalt go  thy way so  took him   hand again  led him into  very dark room where there sat  man   iron cage now  man  look on seemed very sad  sat  his eyes looking down   ground his hands folded together   sighed  if  would break his heart then said christian what means this at which  interpreter bid him talk   man then said christian   man what art thou the man answered i am what i  not once  chr what wast thou once man the man said i  once  fair  flourishing professor both  mine own eyes  also   eyes  others i once was  i thought fair   celestial city  had then even joy   thoughts  i should get thither luke  chr well but what art thou now man i am now  man  despair  am shut up  it   this iron cage i cannot get out oh now i cannot chr but how camest thou  this condition man i left off  watch   sober i laid  reins upon  neck  my lusts i sinned against  light   word   goodness  god i have grieved  spirit    gone i tempted  devil    come  me i have provoked god  anger    left me i have so hardened my heart  i cannot repent  then said christian   interpreter but  there no hope  such  man  this ask him said  interpreter nay said christian pray sir do you inter then said  interpreter is there no hope but you must  kept   iron cage  despair man no none  all inter why  son   blessed  very pitiful man i have crucified him  myself afresh heb  i have despised his person luke  i have despised his righteousness i have counted his blood  unholy thing i have done despite   spirit  grace heb  therefore i have shut myself out  all  promises  there now remains  me nothing but threatenings dreadful threatenings fearful threatenings  certain judgement  fiery indignation which shall devour me   adversary  inter for what did you bring yourself into this condition man for  lusts pleasures  profits  this world   enjoyment  which i did then promise myself much delight but now every one  those things also bite me  gnaw me like  burning worm inter but canst thou not now repent  turn  man god hath denied me repentance his word gives me no encouragement  believe yea himself hath shut me up  this iron cage nor can all  men   world let me out o eternity eternity how shall i grapple   misery  i must meet   eternity inter then said  interpreter  christian let this mans misery  remembered  thee    everlasting caution  thee chr well said christian this  fearful god help me  watch   sober   pray  i may shun  cause  this mans misery sir   not time  me  go  my way now inter tarry till i shall show thee one thing more  then thou shalt go  thy way  so  took christian   hand again  led him into  chamber where there  one rising out  bed    put  his raiment  shook  trembled then said christian why doth this man thus tremble the interpreter then bid him tell  christian  reason  his so doing so  began  said this night  i   my sleep i dreamed  behold  heavens grew exceeding black also  thundered  lightened  most fearful wise   put me into  agony so i looked up  my dream  saw  clouds rack   unusual rate upon which i heard  great sound   trumpet  saw also  man sit upon  cloud attended   thousands  heaven they  all  flaming fire also  heavens    burning flame i heard then  voice saying arise ye dead  come  judgement     rocks rent  graves opened   dead   therein came forth some  them  exceeding glad  looked upward  some sought  hide themselves under  mountains  cor   thes  jude  john   thes  rev  isa  micah  ps  dan  then i saw  man  sat upon  cloud open  book  bid  world draw near yet there was  reason   fierce flame which issued out  came  before him  convenient distance betwixt him  them  betwixt  judge   prisoners   bar mal  dan  i heard  also proclaimed  them  attended   man  sat   cloud gather together  tares  chaff  stubble  cast them into  burning lake matt   mal  and  that  bottomless pit opened just whereabout i stood out   mouth  which there came   abundant manner smoke  coals  fire  hideous noises it  also said   same persons gather my wheat into  garner luke  and   i saw many catched up  carried away into  clouds but i  left behind  thes  i also sought  hide myself but i could not   man  sat upon  cloud still kept his eye upon me my sins also came into my mind  my conscience did accuse me  every side rom  upon this i awaked  my sleep  chr but what    made you so afraid  this sight man why i thought   day  judgement  come   i  not ready  it but this frighted me most   angels gathered up several  left me behind also  pit  hell opened her mouth just where i stood my conscience too afflicted me and  i thought  judge had always his eye upon me shewing indignation  his countenance  then said  interpreter  christian hast thou considered all these things chr yes  they put me  hope  fear inter well keep all things so  thy mind  they may    goad  thy sides  prick thee forward   way thou must go then christian began  gird up his loins   address himself  his journey then said  interpreter the comforter  always  thee good christian  guide thee   way  leads   city so christian went  his way saying here i have seen things rare  profitable things pleasant dreadful things  make me stable in what i have begun  take  hand then let me think  them  understand wherefore they showed me were  let me  thankful o good interpreter  thee  now i saw  my dream   highway up which christian   go  fenced  either side   wall   wall  called salvation isa  up this way therefore did burdened christian run but not without great difficulty because   load  his back  he ran thus till  came   place somewhat ascending  upon  place stood  cross   little below   bottom  sepulchre so i saw  my dream  just  christian came up   cross his burden loosed  off his shoulders  fell  off his back  began  tumble  so continued  do till  came   mouth   sepulchre where  fell in  i saw  no more  then  christian glad  lightsome  said   merry heart he hath given me rest  his sorrow  life  his death then  stood still awhile  look  wonder    very surprising  him   sight   cross should thus ease him  his burden he looked therefore  looked again even till  springs    his head sent  waters down his cheeks zech  now   stood looking  weeping behold three shining ones came  him  saluted him  peace  unto thee so  first said  him thy sins  forgiven thee mark   second stripped him  his rags  clothed him  change  raiment zech   third also set  mark  his forehead  gave him  roll   seal upon it which  bade him look    ran    should give     celestial gate eph  so they went their way whos this  pilgrim how tis very true old things  past away alls become new strange hes another man upon my word they  fine feathers  make  fine bird then christian gave three leaps  joy  went  singing thus far i did come laden  my sin nor could aught ease  grief  i   till i came hither what  place  this must here   beginning  my bliss must here  burden fall  off my back must here  strings  bound   me crack blest cross blest sepulchre blest rather  the man  there  put  shame  me  i saw then  my dream   went  thus even until  came   bottom where  saw  little out   way three men fast asleep  fetters upon their heels the name   one  simple another sloth   third presumption  christian then seeing them lie  this case went  them if peradventure  might awake them  cried you  like them  sleep   top   mast   dead sea  under youa gulf  hath no bottom prov  awake therefore  come away  willing also  i  help you off  your irons he also told them if   goeth about like  roaring lion comes by you  certainly become  prey  his teeth  pet  with  they looked upon him  began  reply  this sort simple said i see no danger sloth said yet  little more sleep  presumption said every fat must stand upon  own bottom what   answer else  i should give thee and so they lay down  sleep again  christian went  his way  yet   troubled  think  men   danger should so little esteem  kindness  him  so freely offered  help them both  awakening  them counselling  them  proffering  help them off  their irons and    troubled thereabout  espied two men come tumbling over  wall   left hand   narrow way  they made up apace  him the name   one  formalist   name   other hypocrisy so  i said they drew up unto him who thus entered  them into discourse  chr gentlemen whence came you  whither go you form  hyp we  born   land  vainglory   going  praise  mount zion chr why came you not    gate which standeth   beginning   way know you not    written    cometh not    door but climbeth up some other way  same   thief   robber john  form  hyp they said that  go   gate  entrance was  all their countrymen counted too far about  that therefore their usual way   make  short cut  it   climb over  wall  they had done chr but   not  counted  trespass against  lord   city whither we  bound thus  violate his revealed will  form  hyp they told him that   that  needed not  trouble his head thereabout  what they did they had custom for  could produce if need were testimony  would witness   more than  thousand years chr but said christian  your practice stand  trial  law form  hyp they told him that custom  being  so long  standing  above  thousand years would doubtless now  admitted   thing legal  any impartial judge  besides said they if we get into  way whats matter which way we get in if we  in we  in thou art but   way who  we perceive came    gate  we  also   way  came tumbling over  wall wherein now  thy condition better than ours chr i walk   rule  my master you walk   rude working  your fancies you  counted thieves already   lord   way therefore i doubt you  not  found true men   end   way you come   yourselves without his direction  shall go out  yourselves without his mercy  to this they made him but little answer only they bid him look  himself then i saw  they went  every man  his way without much conference one  another save  these two men told christian    laws  ordinances they doubted not but they should  conscientiously do them  he therefore said they we see not wherein thou differest  us but   coat    thy back which was  we trow given thee  some  thy neighbours  hide  shame  thy nakedness  chr by laws  ordinances you  not  saved since you came not    door gal  and   this coat    my back   given me   lord   place whither i go  that  you say  cover my nakedness with and i take    token  his kindness  me  i had nothing but rags before and besides thus i comfort myself  i go surely think i when i come   gate   city  lord thereof  know me  good since i have this coat  my backa coat   gave me freely   day   stripped me  my rags i have moreover  mark  my forehead  which perhaps you have taken no notice which one  my lords most intimate associates fixed there   day  my burden fell off my shoulders i  tell you moreover  i had then given me  roll sealed  comfort me  reading  i go   way i  also bid  give     celestial gate  token  my certain going  after it all which things i doubt you want  want them because you came not    gate  to these things they gave him no answer only they looked upon each other  laughed then i saw  they went  all save  christian kept before who had no more talk but  himself   sometimes sighingly  sometimes comfortably also  would  often reading   roll  one   shining ones gave him  which   refreshed  i beheld then  they all went  till they came   foot   hill difficulty   bottom  which   spring there  also   same place two other ways besides  which came straight   gate one turned   left hand   other   right   bottom   hill but  narrow way lay right up  hill   name   going up  side   hill  called difficulty christian now went   spring  drank thereof  refresh himself isa   then began  go up  hill saying the hill though high i covet  ascend the difficulty  not me offend for i perceive  way  life lies here come pluck up heart lets neither faint nor fear better though difficult  right way  go than wrong though easy where  end  woe  the other two also came   foot   hill but when they saw   hill  steep  high   there  two other ways  go  supposing also  these two ways might meet again   up which christian went   other side   hill therefore they  resolved  go  those ways now  name  one  these ways  danger   name   other destruction so  one took  way which  called danger which led him into  great wood   other took directly up  way  destruction which led him into  wide field full  dark mountains where  stumbled  fell  rose no more shall they who wrong begin yet rightly end shall they  all have safety  their friend no no  headstrong manner they set out and headlong  they fall  last no doubt  i looked then after christian  see him go up  hill where i perceived  fell  running  going   going  clambering upon his hands  his knees because   steepness   place now about  midway   top   hill   pleasant arbour made   lord   hill   refreshing  weary travellers thither therefore christian got where also  sat down  rest him then  pulled his roll out  his bosom  read therein  his comfort  also now began afresh  take  review   coat or garment   given him   stood   cross thus pleasing himself awhile   last fell into  slumber  thence into  fast sleep which detained him   place until   almost night   his sleep his roll fell out  his hand now    sleeping there came one  him  awaked him saying go   ant thou sluggard consider her ways   wise prov  and   christian started up  sped him  his way  went apace till  came   top   hill  now when   got up   top   hill there came two men running  meet him amain  name   one  timorous    other mistrust  whom christian said sirs whats  matter you run  wrong way timorous answered  they  going   city  zion  had got up  difficult place but said he  further we go  more danger we meet with wherefore we turned   going back again yes said mistrust  just before us lie  couple  lions   way whether sleeping or waking we know not  we could not think if we came within reach but they would presently pull us  pieces  chr then said christian you make me afraid but whither shall i fly   safe if i go back  mine own country   prepared  fire  brimstone  i shall certainly perish there if i can get   celestial city i am sure    safety there i must venture to go back  nothing but death  go forward  fear  death  lifeeverlasting beyond it i  yet go forward so mistrust  timorous ran down  hill  christian went  his way but thinking again  what  had heard   men  felt  his bosom  his roll   might read therein   comforted but  felt  found  not then  christian  great distress  knew not what  do   wanted  which used  relieve him   which should have been his pass into  celestial city here therefore  begun   much perplexed  knew not what  do at last  bethought himself   had slept   arbour     side   hill and falling down upon his knees  asked gods forgiveness   his foolish act  then went back  look  his roll but all  way  went back who can sufficiently set forth  sorrow  christians heart sometimes  sighed sometimes  wept  oftentimes  chid himself  being so foolish  fall asleep   place which  erected only   little refreshment  his weariness thus therefore  went back carefully looking  this side   that all  way   went if happily  might find his roll  had been his comfort so many times  his journey he went thus till  came again within sight   arbour where  sat  slept but  sight renewed his sorrow  more  bringing again even afresh his evil  sleeping into his mind rev   thes  thus therefore  now went  bewailing his sinful sleep saying o wretched man  i am  i should sleep   daytime  i should sleep   midst  difficulty  i should so indulge  flesh   use  rest  ease  my flesh which  lord   hill hath erected only   relief   spirits  pilgrims  how many steps have i took  vain thus  happened  israel  their sin they  sent back again   way   red sea  i am made  tread those steps  sorrow which i might have trod  delight had  not been  this sinful sleep how far might i have been  my way  this time i am made  tread those steps thrice over which i needed not  have trod but once yea now also i am like   benighted   day  almost spent o  i had not slept  now  this time   come   arbour again where   while  sat down  wept but  last  christian would have it looking sorrowfully down under  settle there  espied his roll  which he  trembling  haste catched up  put  into his bosom but who can tell how joyful this man  when  had gotten his roll again  this roll   assurance  his life  acceptance   desired haven therefore  laid  up  his bosom gave thanks  god  directing his eye   place where  lay   joy  tears betook himself again  his journey but oh how nimbly now did  go up  rest   hill yet before  got up  sun went down upon christian  this made him again recall  vanity  his sleeping  his remembrance  thus  again began  condole  himself o thou sinful sleep how  thy sake am i like   benighted  my journey i must walk without  sun darkness must cover  path  my feet  i must hear  noise   doleful creatures because  my sinful sleep  thes  now also  remembered  story  mistrust  timorous told him of how they  frighted   sight   lions then said christian  himself again these beasts range   night  their prey  if they should meet  me   dark how should i shift them how should i escape being  them torn  pieces thus  went  his way but while   thus bewailing his unhappy miscarriage  lift up his eyes  behold there   very stately palace before him  name  which  beautiful   stood just   highway side  so i saw  my dream   made haste  went forward  if possible  might get lodging there now before  had gone far  entered into  very narrow passage which  about  furlong off  porters lodge  looking very narrowly before him   went  espied two lions   way now thought he i see  dangers  mistrust  timorous  driven back by the lions  chained but  saw not  chains then   afraid  thought also himself  go back after them   thought nothing but death  before him but  porter   lodge whose name  watchful perceiving  christian made  halt  if  would go back cried unto him saying is thy strength so small mark  fear not  lions  they  chained   placed

discourse  christian   best improvement  time  they appointed piety  prudence  charity  discourse  him  thus they began  piety come good christian since we have been so loving  you  receive you  our

moved you  first  betake yourself   pilgrims life chr i  driven out  my native country   dreadful sound    mine ears  wit  unavoidable destruction did attend me if i abode   place where i was piety but how did  happen  you came out  your country this way chr it   god would have it  when i  under  fears  destruction i did not know whither  go but  chance there came  man even  me  i  trembling  weeping whose name  evangelist   directed me   wicketgate which else i should never have found  so set me into  way  hath led me directly  this house  piety but did you not come   house   interpreter chr yes  did see such things there  remembrance  which  stick  me  long  i live especially three things  wit how christ  despite  satan maintains his work  grace   heart how  man had sinned himself quite out  hopes  gods mercy  also  dream  him  thought  his sleep  day  judgement  come piety why did you hear him tell his dream chr yes   dreadful one  was i thought  made my heart ache    telling  it but yet i am glad i heard it  piety was  all  you saw   house   interpreter chr no  took me  had me where  shewed me  stately palace  how  people  clad  gold    it  how there came  venturous man  cut his way through  armed men  stood   door  keep him out  how   bid  come in  win eternal glory methought those things did ravish my heart i would have stayed   good mans house  twelvemonth but  i knew i had further  go  piety and what saw you else   way chr saw why i went but  little further  i saw one  i thought  my mind hang bleeding upon  tree   very sight  him made my burden fall off my back for i groaned under  very heavy burden but then  fell down  off me it   strange thing  me  i never saw such  thing before yea  while i stood looking up  then i could not forbear looking three shining ones came  me one  them testified  my sins  forgiven me another stripped me  my rags  gave me this broidered coat which you see   third set  mark which you see  my forehead  gave me this sealed roll and    plucked  out  his bosom  piety but you saw more than this did you not chr the things  i have told you   best yet some other matters i saw as namelyi saw three men simple sloth  presumption lie asleep  little out   way  i came  irons upon their heels but do you think i could awake them i also saw formality  hypocrisy come tumbling over  wall  go  they pretended  zion but they  quickly lost even  i myself did tell them but they would not believe but above all i found  hard work  get up this hill   hard  come   lions mouths  truly if  had not been   good man  porter  stands   gate i do not know but  after all i might have gone back again but now i thank god i am here  i thank you  receiving  me  then prudence thought good  ask him  few questions  desired his answer  them prud do you not think sometimes   country  whence you came christians thoughts  his native country chr yes but  much shame  detestation truly if i had been mindful   country  whence i came out i might have had opportunity  have returned but now i desire  better country  is  heavenly heb  prud do you not yet bear away  you some   things  then you  conversant withal chr yes but greatly against my will especially my inward  carnal cogitations  which all my countrymen  well  myself  delighted but now all those things  my grief  might i but choose mine own things christians choice i would choose never  think  those things more but when i would  doing   which  best  which  worst   me rom   prud do you not find sometimes  if those things  vanquished which  other times  your perplexity christians golden hours chr yes but   seldom but they   me golden hours  which such things happen  me prud can you remember  what means you find your annoyances  times  if they  vanquished chr yes when i think what i saw   cross   do it  when i look upon my broidered coat   do it also when i look into  roll  i carry  my bosom   do it  when my thoughts wax warm about whither i am going   do it  prud and what    makes you so desirous  go  mount zion chr why there i hope  see him alive  did hang dead   cross  there i hope   rid  all those things   this day   me  annoyance  me there they say there  no death  there i shall dwell  such company  i like best isa  rev  for  tell you truth i love him because i   him eased  my burden  i am weary  my inward sickness i would fain  where i shall die no more    company  shall continually cry holy holy holy  then said charity  christian have you  family are you  married man chr i have  wife  four small children char and why did you not bring them along  you christians love  his wife  children chr then christian wept  said oh how willingly would i have done it but they  all  them utterly averse  my going  pilgrimage char but you should have talked  them  have endeavoured  have shown them  danger  being behind chr so i did  told them also  what god had shown  me   destruction  our city but i seemed  them  one  mocked  they believed me not gen  char and did you pray  god   would bless your counsel  them chr yes    much affection  you must think  my wife  poor children  very dear unto me char but did you tell them  your own sorrow  fear  destruction  i suppose  destruction  visible enough  you christians fears  perishing might  read  his very countenance chr yes over  over  over they might also see my fears  my countenance  my tears  also  my trembling under  apprehension   judgement  did hang over our heads but all  not sufficient  prevail  them  come  me char but what could they say  themselves why they came not  chr why my wife  afraid  losing this world  my children  given   foolish delights  youth so what  one thing  what  another they left me  wander  this manner alone char but did you not  your vain life damp all  you  words used  way  persuasion  bring them away  you  christians good conversation before his wife  children chr indeed i cannot commend my life  i am conscious  myself  many failings therein i know also   man  his conversation may soon overthrow what  argument or persuasion  doth labour  fasten upon others  their good yet this i can say i  very wary  giving them occasion  any unseemly action  make them averse  going  pilgrimage yea  this very thing they would tell me i  too precise   i denied myself  things  their sakes  which they saw no evil nay i think i may say  if what they saw  me did hinder them   my great tenderness  sinning against god or  doing any wrong  my neighbour char indeed cain hated his brother because his own works  evil  his brothers righteous  john   if thy wife  children have been offended  thee  this they thereby show themselves   implacable  good  thou hast delivered thy soul  their blood ezek   now i saw  my dream  thus they sat talking together until supper  ready so when they had made ready they sat down  meat now  table  furnished with fat things   wine   well refined  all their talk   table  about  lord   hill as namely about what  had done  wherefore  did what  did  why  had builded  house and  what they said i perceived   had been  great warrior  had fought   slain him  had  power  death but not without great danger  himself which made me love him  more heb   for  they said   i believe said christian  did    loss  much blood but  which put glory  grace into all  did was   did  out  pure love  his country and besides there  some  them   household  said they had been  spoke  him since  did die   cross  they have attested  they had   his own lips    such  lover  poor pilgrims   like  not   found   east   west  they moreover gave  instance  what they affirmed   was  had stripped himself  his glory   might do this   poor   they heard him say  affirm that  would not dwell   mountain  zion alone they said moreover   had made many pilgrims princes though  nature they  beggars born  their original had been  dunghill  sam  ps   christians bedchamber thus they discoursed together till late  night  after they had committed themselves  their lord  protection they betook themselves  rest  pilgrim they laid   large upper chamber whose window opened towards  sunrising  name   chamber  peace where  slept till break  day  then  awoke  sang where am i now is this  love  care of jesus   men  pilgrims are thus  provide  i should  forgiven and dwell already  next door  heaven  so   morning they all got up and after some more discourse they told him   should not depart till they had shown him  rarities   place and first they had him into  study where they showed him records   greatest antiquity  which  i remember my dream they showed him first  pedigree   lord   hill     son   ancient  days  came   eternal generation here also  more fully recorded  acts   had done   names  many hundreds   had taken into his service  how  had placed them  such habitations  could neither  length  days nor decays  nature  dissolved  then they read  him some   worthy acts  some  his servants had done as how they had subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped  mouths  lions quenched  violence  fire escaped  edge   sword out  weakness  made strong waxed valiant  fight  turned  flight  armies   aliens heb   they then read again  another part   records   house where   shewed how willing their lord   receive into his favour any even any though they  time past had offered great affronts  his person  proceedings here also  several other histories  many other famous things  all which christian had  view   things both ancient  modern together  prophecies  predictions  things  have their certain accomplishment both   dread  amazement  enemies   comfort  solace  pilgrims  the next day they took him  had him into  armoury where they showed him all manner  furniture which their lord had provided  pilgrims  sword shield helmet breastplate allprayer  shoes  would not wear out and there  here enough  this  harness out  many men   service  their lord  there  stars   heaven  multitude  they also showed him some   engines  which some  his servants had done wonderful things they shewed him moses rod  hammer  nail  which jael slew sisera  pitchers trumpets  lamps too  which gideon put  flight  armies  midian then they showed him  oxs goad wherewith shamgar slew six hundred men they showed him also  jawbone  which samson did such mighty feats they showed him moreover  sling  stone  which david slew goliath  gath   sword also  which their lord  kill  man  sin   day   shall rise up   prey they showed him besides many excellent things  which christian  much delighted this done they went  their rest again  then i saw  my dream    morrow  got up  go forward but they desired him  stay till  next day also  then said they we will if  day  clear show you  delectable mountains which they said would yet further add  his comfort because they  nearer  desired haven than  place where  present  was so  consented  stayed when  morning  up they had him   top   house  bid him look south so  did  behold   great distance  saw  most pleasant mountainous country beautified  woods vineyards fruits  all sorts flowers also  springs  fountains very delectable  behold isa  then  asked  name   country they said   immanuels land     common said they  this hill is    all  pilgrims and when thou comest there  thence said they thou mayest see   gate   celestial city   shepherds  live there  make appear  now  bethought himself  setting forward  they  willing  should but first said they let us go again into  armoury so they did  when they came there they harnessed him  head  foot  what   proof lest perhaps  should meet  assaults   way he being therefore thus accoutred walketh out  his friends   gate  there  asked  porter if  saw any pilgrims pass by then  porter answered yes  chr pray did you know him said he por i asked him his name   told me   faithful chr oh said christian i know him   my townsman my near neighbour  comes   place where i  born how far do you think  may  before por he  got  this time below  hill chr well said christian good porter  lord   thee  add  all thy blessings much increase   kindness  thou hast showed  me  then  began  go forward but discretion piety charity  prudence would accompany him down   foot   hill so they went  together reiterating their former discourses till they came  go down  hill then said christian as   difficult coming up so so far  i can see   dangerous going down yes said prudence so  is     hard matter   man  go down into  valley  humiliation  thou art now   catch no slip   way therefore said they  we come out  accompany thee down  hill so  began  go down but very warily yet  caught  slip or two  then i saw  my dream  these good companions when christian  gone   bottom   hill gave him  loaf  bread  bottle  wine   cluster  raisins  then  went  his way but now  this valley  humiliation poor christian  hard put  it   had gone but  little way before  espied  foul fiend coming over  field  meet him his name  apollyon then did christian begin   afraid   cast  his mind whether  go back or  stand his ground but  considered again   had no armour  his back  therefore thought   turn  back  him might give him  greater advantage  ease  pierce him  his darts christians resolution   approach  apollyon therefore  resolved  venture  stand his ground for thought he had i no more  mine eye than  saving  my life  would   best way  stand  so  went on  apollyon met him now  monster  hideous  behold   clothed  scales like  fish and they  his pride  had wings like  dragon feet like  bear  out  his belly came fire  smoke  his mouth    mouth   lion when   come up  christian  beheld him   disdainful countenance  thus began  question  him  apol whence come you  whither  you bound chr i am come   city  destruction which   place  all evil  am going   city  zion apol by this i perceive thou art one  my subjects  all  country  mine  i am  prince  god  it how  it then  thou hast run away  thy king were  not  i hope thou mayest do me more service i would strike thee now  one blow   ground  chr i  born indeed  your dominions but your service  hard  your wages such   man could not live on for  wages  sin  death rom  therefore when i  come  years i did  other considerate persons do look out if perhaps i might mend myself apollyons flattery apol there  no prince   thus lightly lose his subjects neither  i  yet lose thee but since thou complainest  thy service  wages  content  go back what our country  afford i do here promise  give thee chr but i have let myself  another even   king  princes  how can i  fairness go back  thee  apol thou hast done  this according   proverb changed  bad   worse but   ordinary  those  have professed themselves his servants after  while  give him  slip  return again  me do thou so too  all shall  well chr i have given him my faith  sworn my allegiance  him how then can i go back  this  not  hanged   traitor apol thou didst  same  me  yet i am willing  pass  all if now thou wilt yet turn again  go back  chr what i promised thee   my nonage and besides i count  prince under whose banner now i stand  able  absolve me yea   pardon also what i did   my compliance  thee  besides o thou destroying apollyon  speak truth i like his service his wages his servants his government his company  country better than thine and therefore leave off  persuade me further i am his servant  i  follow him  apol consider again when thou art  cool blood what thou art like  meet    way  thou goest thou knowest that   most part his servants come   ill end because they  transgressors against me  my ways how many  them have been put  shameful deaths and besides thou countest his service better than mine whereas  never came yet   place where    deliver any  served him out  their hands but   me how many times  all  world very well knows have i delivered either  power or fraud those  have faithfully served me  him  his though taken  them  so i  deliver thee chr his forbearing  present  deliver them   purpose  try their love whether they  cleave  him   end     ill end thou sayest they come to   most glorious  their account for  present deliverance they do not much expect it  they stay  their glory  then they shall have  when their prince comes  his   glory   angels apol thou hast already been unfaithful  thy service  him  how dost thou think  receive wages  him chr wherein o apollyon have i been unfaithful  him  apol thou didst faint  first setting out when thou wast almost choked   gulf  despond thou didst attempt wrong ways   rid  thy burden whereas thou shouldst have stayed till thy prince had taken  off thou didst sinfully sleep  lose thy choice thing thou wast also almost persuaded  go back   sight   lions  when thou talkest  thy journey   what thou hast heard  seen thou art inwardly desirous  vainglory  all  thou sayest or doest chr all this  true  much more which thou hast left out but  prince whom i serve  honour  merciful  ready  forgive but besides these infirmities possessed me  thy country  there i sucked them in  i have groaned under them been sorry  them  have obtained pardon  my prince  apol then apollyon broke out into  grievous rage saying i am  enemy  this prince i hate his person his laws  people i am come out  purpose  withstand thee chr apollyon beware what you do  i am   kings highway  way  holiness therefore take heed  yourself apol then apollyon straddled quite over  whole breadth   way  said i am void  fear  this matter prepare thyself  die  i swear  my infernal den  thou shalt go no further here  i spill thy soul  and    threw  flaming dart  his breast but christian had  shield  his hand  which  caught it  so prevented  danger  that then did christian draw   saw   time  bestir him  apollyon  fast made  him throwing darts  thick  hail   which notwithstanding all  christian could do  avoid it apollyon wounded him  his head his hand  foot this made christian give  little back apollyon therefore followed his work amain  christian again took courage  resisted  manfully   could this sore combat lasted  above half  day even till christian  almost quite spent  you must know  christian  reason  his wounds must needs grow weaker  weaker  then apollyon espying his opportunity began  gather up close  christian  wrestling  him gave him  dreadful fall    christians sword flew out  his hand then said apollyon i am sure  thee now and    had almost pressed him  death so  christian began  despair  life but  god would have it while apollyon  fetching  his last blow thereby  make  full end  this good man christian nimbly stretched out his hand  his sword  caught it saying rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i shall arise micah  christians victory over apollyon    gave him  deadly thrust which made him give back  one  had received his mortal wound christian perceiving that made  him again saying nay  all these things we  more than conquerors through him  loved us rom  and   apollyon spread forth his dragons wings  sped him away  christian   season saw him no more james   in this combat no man can imagine unless  had seen  heard  i did what yelling  hideous roaring apollyon made all  time   fighthe spake like  dragon and   other side what sighs  groans burst  christians heart i never saw him all  while give so much  one pleasant look till  perceived  had wounded apollyon  his twoedged sword then indeed  did smile  look upward but    dreadfullest sight  ever i saw a more unequal match can hardly bechristian must fight  angel but you see the valiant man  handling sword  shield doth make him tho  dragon quit  field  so when  battle  over christian said i  here give thanks  him  delivered me out   mouth   lion  him  did help me against apollyon and so  did saying great beelzebub  captain  this fiend designd my ruin therefore  this end he sent him harnessd out    rage that hellish was did fiercely me engage but blessed michael helped me  i by dint  sword did quickly make him fly therefore  him let me give lasting praise and thank  bless his holy name always  then there came  him  hand  some   leaves   tree  life  which christian took  applied   wounds   had received   battle   healed immediately he also sat down   place  eat bread   drink   bottle   given him  little before so being refreshed  addressed himself  his journey  his sword drawn  his hand   said i know not but some other enemy may   hand but  met  no other affront  apollyon quite through this valley  now   end  this valley  another called  valley   shadow  death  christian must needs go through it because  way   celestial city lay through  midst  it now this valley   very solitary place the prophet jeremiah thus describes it a wilderness  land  deserts   pits  land  drought    shadow  death  land  no man but  christian passed through  where no man dwelt jer  now here christian  worse put   than  his fight  apollyon    sequel you shall see  i saw then  my dream  when christian  got   borders   shadow  death there met him two men children  them  brought up  evil report   good land num  making haste  go back  whom christian spake  follows  chr whither  you going men they said back back  we would have you  do so too if either life or peace  prized  you chr why whats  matter said christian men matter said they we  going  way  you  going  went  far  we durst  indeed we  almost past coming back  had we gone  little further we had not been here  bring  news  thee chr but what have you met with said christian men why we  almost   valley   shadow  death but that  good hap we looked before us  saw  danger before we came  it ps   chr but what have you seen said christian  men seen why  valley itself which   dark  pitch we also saw there  hobgoblins satyrs  dragons   pit we heard also   valley  continual howling  yelling    people under unutterable misery who there sat bound  affliction  irons  over  valley hangs  discouraging clouds  confusion death also doth always spread his wings over it in  word   every whit dreadful being utterly without order job   chr then said christian i perceive not yet  what you have said but  this  my way   desired haven jer  men be  thy way we  not choose   ours so they parted  christian went  his way but still  his sword drawn  his hand  fear lest  should  assaulted  i saw then  my dream so far  this valley reached there    right hand  very deep ditch  ditch   into which  blind have led  blind  all ages  have both there miserably perished ps  again behold   left hand there   very dangerous quag into which if even  good man falls  can find no bottom  his foot  stand on into  quag king david once did fall  had no doubt therein been smothered had not he   able plucked him out  the pathway  here also exceeding narrow  therefore good christian   more put  it  when  sought   dark  shun  ditch   one hand   ready  tip over into  mire   other also when  sought  escape  mire without great carefulness  would  ready  fall into  ditch thus  went on  i heard him here sigh bitterly for besides  dangers mentioned above  pathway  here so dark  ofttimes when  lift up his foot  set forward  knew not where or upon what  should set  next poor man where art thou now thy day  night good man  not cast down thou yet art right thy way  heaven lies   gates  hell cheer up hold out  thee  shall go well  about  midst  this valley i perceived  mouth  hell  be   stood also hard   wayside now thought christian what shall i do and ever  anon  flame  smoke would come out  such abundance  sparks  hideous noises things  cared not  christians sword  did apollyon before    forced  put up his sword  betake himself  another weapon called allprayer eph  so  cried  my hearing o lord i beseech thee deliver my soul ps  thus  went   great while yet still  flames would  reaching towards him also  heard doleful voices  rushings   fro so  sometimes  thought  should  torn  pieces or trodden down like mire   streets this frightful sight  seen  these dreadful noises  heard  him  several miles together and coming   place where  thought  heard  company  fiends coming forward  meet him  stopped  began  muse what  had best  do sometimes  had half  thought  go back then again  thought  might  half way through  valley  remembered also how  had already vanquished many  danger    danger  going back might  much more than   go forward so  resolved  go on yet  fiends seemed  come nearer  nearer but when they  come even almost  him  cried out   most vehement voice i  walk   strength   lord god so they gave back  came no further  one thing i would not let slip i took notice  now poor christian  so confounded   did not know his own voice  thus i perceived it just when   come over against  mouth   burning pit one   wicked ones got behind him  stepped up softly  him  whisperingly suggested many grievous blasphemies  him which  verily thought had proceeded  his own mind this put christian more   than anything   met  before even  think   should now blaspheme him   loved so much before yet if  could have helped it  would not have done it but  had not  discretion either  stop his ears or  know  whence these blasphemies came  when christian had travelled  this disconsolate condition some considerable time  thought  heard  voice   man  going before him saying though i walk through  valley   shadow  death i  fear no evil  thou art  me ps   then   glad    these reasons first because  gathered  thence  some who feared god   this valley  well  himself secondly for   perceived god   them though   dark  dismal state  why not thought he  me though  reason   impediment  attends this place i cannot perceive it job  thirdly for   hoped could  overtake them  have company   by so  went on  called  him   before but  knew not what  answer    also thought   alone and     day broke then said christian he hath turned the shadow  death into  morning amos   now morning being come  looked back not out  desire  return but  see   light   day what hazards  had gone through   dark so  saw more perfectly  ditch     one hand   mire     other also how narrow  way  which led betwixt them both also now  saw  hobgoblins  satyrs  dragons   pit but all afar off for after break  day they came not nigh yet they  discovered  him according   which  written he discovereth deep things out  darkness  bringeth out  light  shadow  death job   now  christian much affected  his deliverance  all  dangers  his solitary way which dangers though  feared them more before yet  saw them more clearly now because  light   day made them conspicuous  him and about this time  sun  rising  this  another mercy  christian  you must note  though  first part   valley   shadow  death  dangerous yet this second part which   yet  go was if possible far more dangerous    place where  now stood even   end   valley  way  all along set so full  snares traps gins  nets here  so full  pits pitfalls deep holes  shelvings down there that had  now been dark    when  came  first part   way had  had  thousand souls they had  reason been cast away but  i said just now  sun  rising then said he his candle shineth upon my head   his light i walk through darkness job   in this light therefore  came   end   valley now i saw  my dream    end  this valley lay blood bones ashes  mangled bodies  men even  pilgrims  had gone this way formerly  while i  musing what should   reason i espied  little before me  cave where two giants pope  pagan dwelt  old time  whose power  tyranny  men whose bones blood  ashes c lay there  cruelly put  death but  this place christian went without much danger whereat i somewhat wondered but i have learnt since  pagan  been dead many  day     other though   yet alive  is  reason  age  also   many shrewd brushes   met   his younger days grown so crazy  stiff  his joints   can now do little more than sit  his caves mouth grinning  pilgrims  they go by  biting his nails because  cannot come  them  so i saw  christian went  his way yet   sight   old man  sat   mouth   cave  could not tell what  think especially because  spake  him though  could not go after him saying you  never mend till more  you  burned but  held his peace  set  good face  it  so went   catched no hurt then sang christian o world  wonders i can say no less that i should  preserved   distress that i have met  here o blessed  that hand    hath deliverd me dangers  darkness devils hell  sin did compass me while i this vale  in yea snares  pits  traps  nets did lie my path about  worthless silly i might have been catchd entangled  cast down but since i live let jesus wear  crown  now  christian went  his way  came   little ascent which  cast up  purpose  pilgrims might see before them up there therefore christian went  looking forward  saw faithful before him upon his journey then said christian aloud ho ho soho stay  i   your companion at that faithful looked behind him  whom christian cried again stay stay till i come up  you but faithful answered no i am upon my life   avenger  blood  behind me  at this christian  somewhat moved  putting  all his strength  quickly got up  faithful  did also overrun him so  last  first then did christian vaingloriously smile because  had gotten  start  his brother but not taking good heed  his feet  suddenly stumbled  fell  could not rise again until faithful came up  help him christians fall makes faithful   go lovingly together then i saw  my dream they went very lovingly  together  had sweet discourse  all things  had happened  them  their pilgrimage  thus christian began  chr my honoured  wellbeloved brother faithful i am glad  i have overtaken you   god  so tempered our spirits  we can walk  companions  this so pleasant  path faith i had thought dear friend  have had your company quite  our town but you did get  start  me wherefore i  forced  come thus much   way alone chr how long did you stay   city  destruction before you set out after me  your pilgrimage faith till i could stay no longer  there  great talk presently after you  gone out  our city would  short time  fire  heaven  burned down   ground chr what did your neighbours talk so faith yes     while  everybodys mouth chr what  did no more  them but you come out  escape  danger faith though there was  i said  great talk thereabout yet i do not think they did firmly believe it for   heat   discourse i heard some  them deridingly speak  you   your desperate journey for so they called this your pilgrimage but i did believe  do still   end  our city    fire  brimstone  above  therefore i have made my escape  chr did you hear no talk  neighbour pliable faith yes christian i heard   followed you till  came   slough  despond where  some said  fell in but  would not  known  have so done but i am sure   soundly bedabbled   kind  dirt chr and what said  neighbours  him faith he hath since his going back been had greatly  derision   among all sorts  people some do mock  despise him  scarce  any set him  work he  now seven times worse than if  had never gone out   city chr but why should they  so set against him since they also despise  way   forsook faith oh they say hang him    turncoat   not true  his profession i think god  stirred up even his enemies  hiss  him  make him  proverb because  hath forsaken  way jer  chr had you no talk  him before you came out faith i met him once   streets but  leered away   other side  one ashamed  what  had done so i spake not  him  chr well  my first setting out i had hopes   man but now i fear   perish   overthrow   city    happened  him according   true proverb the dog  turned  his own vomit again   sow   washed  her wallowing   mire  pet  faith these  my fears  him too but who can hinder  which  be chr well neighbour faithful said christian let us leave him  talk  things  more immediately concern ourselves tell me now what you have met    way  you came  i know you have met  some things or else  may  writ   wonder  faith i escaped  slough  i perceived you fell into  got up   gate without  danger only i met  one whose name  wanton who had like  have done me  mischief chr it  well you escaped her net joseph  hard put    her   escaped her  you did but  had like  have cost him his life gen  but what did she do  you faith you cannot think but  you know something what  flattering tongue she had she lay  me hard  turn aside  her promising me all manner  content chr nay she did not promise you  content   good conscience faith you know what i mean all carnal  fleshly content chr thank god you have escaped her the abhorred   lord shall fall into her ditch ps  faith nay i know not whether i did wholly escape her or no chr why i trow you did not consent  her desires faith no not  defile myself  i remembered  old writing  i had seen which said her steps take hold  hell prov  so i shut mine eyes because i would not  bewitched  her looks job  then she railed  me  i went my way chr did you meet  no other assault  you came  faith when i came   foot   hill called difficulty i met   very aged man who asked me what i was  whither bound i told him  i am  pilgrim going   celestial city then said  old man thou lookest like  honest fellow wilt thou  content  dwell  me   wages  i shall give thee then i asked him his name  where  dwelt he said his name  adam  first    dwelt   town  deceit eph  i asked him then what  his work  what  wages  would give he told me  his work  many delights  his wages  i should  his heir  last i further asked him what house  kept  what other servants  had so  told me  his house  maintained  all  dainties   world   his servants  those  his own begetting then i asked if  had any children he said   had but three daughters the lust   flesh the lust   eyes  the pride  life   i should marry them all if i would  john  then i asked how long time  would have me live  him and  told me as long   lived himself chr well  what conclusion came  old man  you   last faith why  first i found myself somewhat inclinable  go   man  i thought  spake very fair but looking  his forehead  i talked  him i saw there written put off  old man  his deeds chr and how then  faith then  came burning hot into my mind whatever  said  however  flattered when  got me home  his house  would sell me   slave so i bid him forbear  talk  i would not come near  door  his house then  reviled me  told me   would send such  one after me  should make my way bitter  my soul so i turned  go away  him but just  i turned myself  go thence i felt him take hold  my flesh  give me such  deadly twitch back  i thought  had pulled part  me after himself this made me cry o wretched man rom  so i went  my way up  hill now when i had got about halfway up i looked behind  saw one coming after me swift   wind so  overtook me just about  place where  settle stands chr just there said christian did i sit down  rest me but being overcome  sleep i there lost this roll out  my bosom  faith but good brother hear me out so soon   man overtook me   but  word   blow  down  knocked me  laid me  dead but when i   little come  myself again i asked him wherefore  served me so he said because  my secret inclining  adam  first     struck me another deadly blow   breast  beat me down backward so i lay  his foot  dead  before so when i came  myself again i cried him mercy but  said i know not how  show mercy     knocked me down again he had doubtless made  end  me but  one came by  bid him forbear chr who    bid him forbear faith i did not know him  first but   went by i perceived  holes  his hands   his side then i concluded    our lord so i went up  hill  chr that man  overtook you  moses he spareth none neither knoweth  how  show mercy  those  transgress his law faith i know  very well   not  first time    met  me it    came  me when i dwelt securely  home   told me  would burn my house over my head if i stayed there chr but did you not see  house  stood there   top   hill   side  which moses met you faith yes   lions too before i came  it but   lions i think they  asleep    about noon  because i had so much   day before me i passed   porter  came down  hill chr he told me indeed   saw you go by but i wish you had called   house  they would have showed you so many rarities  you would scarce have forgot them   day  your death but pray tell me did you meet nobody   valley  humility  faith yes i met  one discontent who would willingly have persuaded me  go back again  him his reason was    valley  altogether without honour he told me moreover  there  go   way  disobey all my friends  pride arrogancy selfconceit worldlyglory  others who  knew   said would  very much offended if i made such  fool  myself   wade through this valley chr well  how did you answer him  faithfuls answer  discontent faith i told him  although all these   named might claim kindred  me   rightly  indeed they  my relations according   flesh yet since i became  pilgrim they have disowned me  i also have rejected them  therefore they   me now no more than if they had never been  my lineage i told him moreover    this valley  had quite misrepresented  thing  before honour  humility   haughty spirit before  fall therefore said i i had rather go through this valley   honour   so accounted   wisest than choose  which  esteemed most worthy our affections chr met you  nothing else   valley  faith yes i met  shame but  all  men  i met   my pilgrimage he i think bears  wrong name the others would  said nay after  little argumentation  somewhat else but this boldfaced shame would never have done chr why what did  say  you faith what why  objected against religion itself  said    pitiful low sneaking business   man  mind religion  said   tender conscience   unmanly thing     man  watch over his words  ways so   tie up himself   hectoring liberty   brave spirits   times accustom themselves unto would make him  ridicule   times he objected also  but few   mighty rich or wise  ever  my opinion  cor   phil  nor any  them neither john  before they  persuaded   fools      voluntary fondness  venture  loss  all  nobody knows what he moreover objected  base  low estate  condition  those   chiefly  pilgrims   times  which they lived also their ignorance  want  understanding  all natural science yea  did hold me     rate also about  great many more things than here i relate as     shame  sit whining  mourning under  sermon   shame  come sighing  groaning home     shame  ask my neighbour forgiveness  petty faults or  make restitution where i have taken  any he said also  religion made  man grow strange   great because   few vices which  called  finer names  made him own  respect  base because   same religious fraternity and  not this said he  shame  chr and what did you say  him faith say i could not tell what  say   first yea  put me so  it  my blood came up  my face even this shame fetched  up  had almost beat me quite off but  last i began  consider  that which  highly esteemed among men  had  abomination  god luke  and i thought again this shame tells me what men are but  tells me nothing what god or  word  god is and i thought moreover    day  doom we shall not  doomed  death or life according   hectoring spirits   world but according   wisdom  law   highest therefore thought i what god says  best indeed  best though all  men   world  against it seeing then  god prefers his religion seeing god prefers  tender conscience seeing they  make themselves fools   kingdom  heaven  wisest    poor man  loveth christ  richer than  greatest man   world  hates him shame depart thou art  enemy  my salvation shall i entertain thee against my sovereign lord how then shall i look him   face  his coming should i now  ashamed  his ways  servants how can i expect  blessing mark  but indeed this shame   bold villain i could scarce shake him out  my company yea  would  haunting  me  continually whispering me   ear  some one or other   infirmities  attend religion but  last i told him   but  vain  attempt further  this business  those things   disdained  those did i see most glory  so  last i got past this importunate one and when i had shaken him off then i began  sing the trials  those men do meet withal that  obedient   heavenly call are manifold  suited   flesh and come  come  come again afresh that now or sometime else we  them may be taken overcome  cast away oh let  pilgrims let  pilgrims then be vigilant  quit themselves like men  chr i am glad my brother  thou didst withstand this villain so bravely   all  thou sayest i think    wrong name    so bold   follow us   streets   attempt  put us  shame before all men  is  make us ashamed   which  good but if   not himself audacious  would never attempt  do   does but let us still resist him  notwithstanding all his bravadoes  promoteth  fool  none else the wise shall inherit glory said solomon but shame shall   promotion  fools prov  faith i think we must cry  him  help against shame who would have us   valiant   truth upon  earth chr you say true but did you meet nobody else   valley faith no not i  i had sunshine all  rest   way through that  also through  valley   shadow  death  chr it  well  you i am sure  fared far otherwise  me i had   long season  soon almost  i entered into  valley  dreadful combat   foul fiend apollyon yea i thought verily  would have killed me especially when  got me down  crushed me under him  if  would have crushed me  pieces    threw me my sword flew out  my hand nay  told me   sure  me but i cried  god   heard me  delivered me out  all my troubles then i entered into  valley   shadow  death  had no light  almost half  way through it i thought i should have been killed there over  over but  last day broke   sun rose  i went through  which  behind  far more ease  quiet  moreover i saw  my dream   they went on faithful   chanced  look  one side saw  man whose name  talkative walking   distance beside them   this place there  room enough  them all  walk he   tall man  something more comely   distance than  hand to this man faithful addressed himself  this manner faith friend whither away are you going   heavenly country talk i am going   same place faith that  well then i hope we may have your good company talk with  very good   i  your companion  faith come on then  let us go together  let us spend our time  discoursing  things   profitable talkatives dislike  bad discourse talk to talk  things   good  me  very acceptable  you or  any other  i am glad  i have met  those  incline  so good  work for  speak  truth there  but few  care thus  spend their time as they   their travels but choose much rather   speaking  things  no profit  this hath been  trouble  me faith that  indeed  thing   lamented  what things so worthy   use   tongue  mouth  men  earth    things   god  heaven talk i like you wonderful well  your sayings  full  conviction  i  add what thing  so pleasant  what so profitable   talk   things  god what things so pleasant that is if  man hath any delight  things   wonderful for instance if  man doth delight  talk   history or  mystery  things or if  man doth love  talk  miracles wonders or signs where shall  find things recorded so delightful  so sweetly penned    holy scripture  faith that  true but   profited  such things  our talk should   which we design talkatives fine discourse talk that    i said   talk  such things  most profitable   so doing  man may get knowledge  many things    vanity  earthly things   benefit  things above thus  general but more particularly  this  man may learn  necessity   new birth  insufficiency  our works  need  christs righteousness c besides  this  man may learn  talk what    repent  believe  pray  suffer or  like  this also  man may learn what   great promises  consolations   gospel  his own comfort further  this  man may learn  refute false opinions  vindicate  truth  also  instruct  ignorant faith all this  true  glad am i  hear these things  you talk alas  want  this   cause why so few understand  need  faith   necessity   work  grace  their soul  order  eternal life but ignorantly live   works   law  which  man can  no means obtain  kingdom  heaven  faith but  your leave heavenly knowledge  these   gift  god no man attaineth  them  human industry or only   talk  them talk all this i know very well   man can receive nothing except   given him  heaven all   grace not  works i could give you  hundred scriptures   confirmation  this faith well then said faithful what   one thing  we shall  this time found our discourse upon talk what you will i  talk  things heavenly or things earthly things moral or things evangelical things sacred or things profane things past or things  come things foreign or things  home things more essential or things circumstantial provided  all  done  our profit  faith now did faithful begin  wonder  stepping  christian for  walked all this while  himself  said  him but softly what  brave companion have we got surely this man  make  very excellent pilgrim chr at this christian modestly smiled  said this man  whom you  so taken  beguile   tongue  his twenty  them  know him not faith do you know him then  chr know him yes better than  knows himself faith pray what  he chr his name  talkative  dwelleth  our town i wonder  you should   stranger  him only i consider  our town  large faith whose son  he and whereabout does  dwell chr he   son  one saywell  dwelt  prating row   known  all   acquainted  him   name  talkative  prating row  notwithstanding his fine tongue   but  sorry fellow  faith well  seems    very pretty man chr that is  them who have not thorough acquaintance  him    best abroad near home   ugly enough your saying     pretty man brings  my mind what i have observed   work   painter whose pictures show best   distance but very near more unpleasing  faith but i am ready  think you do but jest because you smiled chr god forbid  i should jest although i smiled  this matter or  i should accuse any falsely i  give you  further discovery  him this man   any company   any talk   talketh now  you so   talk when     alebench   more drink  hath  his crown  more  these things  hath  his mouth religion hath no place  his heart or house or conversation all  hath lieth  his tongue  his religion is  make  noise therewith  faith say you so then am i  this man greatly deceived chr deceived you may  sure  it remember  proverb they say  do not matt  but  kingdom  god  not  word but  power  cor  he talketh  prayer  repentance  faith    new birth but  knows but only  talk  them i have been  his family  have observed him both  home  abroad  i know what i say  him   truth his house   empty  religion   white   egg   savour there  there neither prayer nor sign  repentance  sin yea  brute  his kind serves god far better than he he   very stain reproach  shame  religion  all  know him  can hardly have  good word  all  end   town where  dwells through him rom  thus say  common people  know him a saint abroad   devil  home his poor family finds  so   such  churl such  railer   so unreasonable  his servants  they neither know how  do  or speak  him men  have any dealings  him say   better  deal   turk than  him  fairer dealing they shall have  their hands this talkative if   possible  go beyond them defraud beguile  overreach them besides  brings up his sons  follow his steps  if  findeth  any  them  foolish timorousness for so  calls  first appearance   tender conscience  calls them fools  blockheads   no means  employ them  much or speak  their commendations before others for my part i am  opinion   has  his wicked life caused many  stumble  fall   be if god prevent not  ruin  many more  faith well my brother i am bound  believe you not only because you say you know him but also because like  christian you make your reports  men for i cannot think  you speak these things  illwill but because   even so  you say chr had i known him no more than you i might perhaps have thought  him as   first you did yea had  received this report  their hands only   enemies  religion i should have thought  had been  slandera lot  often falls  bad mens mouths upon good mens names  professions but all these things yea   great many more  bad  my own knowledge i can prove him guilty of besides good men  ashamed  him they can neither call him brother nor friend  very naming  him among them makes them blush if they know him  faith well i see  saying  doing  two things  hereafter i shall better observe this distinction chr they  two things indeed    diverse    soul   body    body without  soul  but  dead carcass so saying if   alone  but  dead carcass also the soul  religion   practical part pure religion  undefiled before god   father  this to visit  fatherless  widows  their affliction   keep himself unspotted   world james  see vv  this talkative  not aware of  thinks  hearing  saying  make  good christian  thus  deceiveth his own soul hearing  but   sowing   seed talking  not sufficient  prove  fruit  indeed   heart  life  let us assure ourselves    day  doom men shall  judged according  their fruits matt   it  not  said then did you believe but were you doers or talkers only  accordingly shall they  judged the end   world  compared  our harvest  you know men  harvest regard nothing but fruit not  anything can  accepted   not  faith but i speak this  show you how insignificant  profession  talkative     day  faith this brings  my mind   moses  which  describeth  beast   clean lev  deut  he  such  one  parteth  hoof  cheweth  cud not  parteth  hoof only or  cheweth  cud only the hare cheweth  cud but yet  unclean because  parteth not  hoof and this truly resembleth talkative  cheweth  cud  seeketh knowledge  cheweth upon  word but  divideth not  hoof  parteth not   way  sinners but   hare  retaineth  foot   dog or bear  therefore   unclean chr you have spoken  aught i know  true gospel sense  those texts and i  add another thing paul calleth some men yea  those great talkers too sounding brass  tinkling cymbals  is   expounds them  another place things without life giving sound  cor   things without life  is without  true faith  grace   gospel  consequently things  shall never  placed   kingdom  heaven among those    children  life though their sound  their talk   if    tongue or voice   angel faith well i  not so fond  his company  first but i am  sick   now what shall we do   rid  him chr take my advice  do  i bid you  you shall find    soon  sick  your company too except god shall touch his heart  turn it faith what would you have me  do chr why go  him  enter into some serious discourse about  power  religion  ask him plainly when   approved  it    will whether this thing  set up  his heart house or conversation  faith then faithful stepped forward again  said  talkative come what cheer how   now talk thank you well i thought we should have had  great deal  talk  this time  faith well if you will we  fall   now  since you left   me  state  question let   this how doth  saving grace  god discover itself when     heart  man talkatives false discovery   work  grace talk i perceive then  our talk must  about  power  things well    very good question  i shall  willing  answer you and take my answer  brief thus first where  grace  god    heart  causeth there  great outcry against sin secondly faith nay hold let us consider  one  once i think you should rather say it shows itself  inclining  soul  abhor  sin talk why what difference  there between crying out against  abhorring  sin  faith oh  great deal a man may cry out against sin  policy but  cannot abhor it but  virtue   godly antipathy against it i have heard many cry out against sin   pulpit who yet can abide  well enough   heart house  conversation josephs mistress cried out   loud voice  if she had been very holy but she would willingly notwithstanding that have committed uncleanness  him some cry out against sin even   mother cries out against her child  her lap when she calleth  slut  naughty girl  then falls  hugging  kissing it talk you lie   catch i perceive  faith no not i i am only  setting things right but what   second thing whereby you would prove  discovery   work  grace   heart talk great knowledge  gospel mysteries faith this sign should have been first but first or last   also false  knowledge great knowledge may  obtained   mysteries   gospel  yet no work  grace   soul  cor  yea if  man have all knowledge  may yet  nothing  so consequently  no child  god when christ said do you know all these things   disciples had answered yes  addeth blessed  ye if ye do them he doth not lay  blessing   knowing  them but   doing  them for there   knowledge   not attended  doing he  knoweth his masters will  doeth  not a man may know like  angel  yet  no christian therefore your sign    not true indeed  know   thing  pleaseth talkers  boasters but  do   which pleaseth god not   heart can  good without knowledge  without that  heart  naught there is therefore knowledge  knowledge knowledge  resteth   bare speculation  things  knowledge   accompanied   grace  faith  love which puts  man upon doing even    god   heart  first  these  serve  talker but without  other  true christian  not content give me understanding  i shall keep thy law yea i shall observe   my whole heart ps  talk you lie   catch again this  not  edification faith well if you please propound another sign how this work  grace discovereth itself where  is talk not i  i see we shall not agree faith well if you  not  you give me leave  do it talk you may use your liberty  faith a work  grace   soul discovereth itself either  him  hath it or  standers by to him  hath  thus it gives him conviction  sin especially   defilement  his nature   sin  unbelief for  sake  which   sure   damned if  findeth not mercy  gods hand  faith  jesus christ john  rom  john  mark  this sight  sense  things worketh  him sorrow  shame  sin  findeth moreover revealed  him  saviour   world   absolute necessity  closing  him  life   which

now  his abused reason make his mind  misjudge  this matter therefore  him  hath this work there  required  very sound judgement before  can  steadiness conclude  this   work  grace  to others   thus

practical subjection  faith  love   power   word john  ps  job  eze  and now sir   this brief description   work  grace  also  discovery  it if you have aught  object object if not then give me leave  propound  you  second question  talk nay my part  not now  object but  hear let me therefore have your second question faith it  this do you experience this first part  this description  it  doth your life  conversation testify  same or standeth your religion  word or  tongue  not  deed  truth pray if you incline  answer me  this say no more than you know  god above  say amen to  also nothing but what your conscience can justify you in  not   commendeth himself  approved but whom  lord commendeth besides  say i am thus  thus when my conversation  all my neighbours tell me i lie  great wickedness  talk then talkative  first began  blush but recovering himself thus  replied you come now  experience  conscience  god   appeal  him  justification  what  spoken this kind  discourse i did not expect nor am i disposed  give  answer  such questions because i count not myself bound thereto unless you take upon you    catechiser and though you should so do yet i may refuse  make you my judge but i pray  you tell me why you ask me such questions  faith because i saw you forward  talk  because i knew not  you had aught else but notion besides  tell you all  truth i have heard  you  you   man whose religion lies  talk   your conversation gives this your mouthprofession  lie faithfuls plain dealing  talkative they say you   spot among christians   religion fareth  worse  your ungodly conversation  some have already stumbled  your wicked ways   more   danger  being destroyed thereby your religion   alehouse  covetousness  uncleanness  swearing  lying  vaincompany keeping c  stand together the proverb  true  you which  said   whore  wit  she   shame  all women so  you  shame  all professors talk since you  ready  take up reports   judge so rashly  you do i cannot but conclude you  some peevish or melancholy man not fit   discoursed with  so adieu  chr then came up christian  said  his brother i told you how  would happen your words  his lusts could not agree  had rather leave your company than reform his life but   gone  i said let him go  loss  no mans but his own   saved us  trouble  going  him   continuing as i suppose   do   is  would have been but  blot  our company besides  apostle says from such withdraw thyself faith but i am glad we had this little discourse  him  may happen    think   again however i have dealt plainly  him  so am clear  his blood if  perisheth  chr you did well  talk so plainly  him  you did there  but little  this faithful dealing  men nowadays   makes religion  stink so   nostrils  many   doth  they  these talkative fools whose religion  only  word   debauched  vain  their conversation  being so much admitted into  fellowship   godly do puzzle  world blemish christianity  grieve  sincere i wish  all men would deal  such  you have done then should they either  made more conformable  religion or  company  saints would  too hot  them then did faithful say how talkative  first lifts up his plumes how bravely doth  speak how  presumes to drive down all before him but so soon as faithful talks  heartwork like  moon thats past  full into  wane  goes and so  all but   heartwork knows  thus they went  talking  what they had seen   way  so made  way easy which would otherwise no doubt have been tedious  them  now they went through  wilderness  now when they  got almost quite out  this wilderness faithful chanced  cast his eye back  espied one coming after them   knew him oh said faithful  his brother who comes yonder then christian looked  said it  my good friend evangelist ay  my good friend too said faithful      set me   way   gate now  evangelist come up  them  thus saluted them  evan peace   you dearly beloved  peace   your helpers chr welcome welcome my good evangelist  sight  thy countenance brings  my remembrance thy ancient kindness  unwearied labouring  my eternal good faith and  thousand times welcome said good faithful thy company o sweet evangelist how desirable    us poor pilgrims evan then said evangelist how hath  fared  you my friends since  time  our last parting what have you met with  how have you behaved yourselves  then christian  faithful told him  all things  had happened  them   way  how   what difficulty they had arrived   place  evan right glad am i said evangelist not  you have met  trials but  you have been victors    you have notwithstanding many weaknesses continued   way  this very day i say right glad am i  this thing    mine own sake  yours i have sowed  you have reaped   day  coming when both   sowed  they  reaped shall rejoice together  is if you hold out for  due season ye shall reap if ye faint not john  gal  the crown  before you     incorruptible one so run  you may obtain it  cor  some there   set out  this crown and after they have gone far  it another comes in  takes   them hold fast therefore  you have let no man take your crown rev  you  not yet out   gunshot   devil you have not resisted unto blood striving against sin let  kingdom  always before you  believe steadfastly concerning things   invisible let nothing    this side  other world get within you and above all look well  your own hearts    lusts thereof for they  deceitful above all things  desperately wicked set your faces like  flint you have all power  heaven  earth  your side  chr then christian thanked him  his exhortation but told him withal  they would have him speak further  them  their help  rest   way   rather   they well knew     prophet  could tell them  things  might happen unto them  also how they might resist  overcome them to which request faithful also consented so evangelist began  followeth evan my sons you have heard   words   truth   gospel  you must through many tribulations enter into  kingdom  heaven and again   every city bonds  afflictions abide  you  therefore you cannot expect  you should go long  your pilgrimage without them  some sort or other you have found something   truth  these testimonies upon you already  more  immediately follow  now  you see you  almost out  this wilderness  therefore you  soon come into  town  you     see before you    town you   hardly beset  enemies who  strain hard but they  kill you   you sure  one or both  you must seal  testimony which you hold  blood but  you faithful unto death   king  give you  crown  life  he  shall die there although his death   unnatural  his pain perhaps great   yet have  better  his fellow not only because    arrived   celestial city soonest but because   escape many miseries   other  meet    rest  his journey but when you  come   town  shall find fulfilled what i have here related then remember your friend  quit yourselves like men  commit  keeping  your souls  your god  welldoing  unto  faithful creator  then i saw  my dream  when they  got out   wilderness they presently saw  town before them   name   town  vanity    town there   fair kept called vanity fair   kept all  year long it beareth  name  vanity fair because  town where   kept  lighter than vanity and also because all   there sold or  cometh thither  vanity as   saying   wise all  cometh  vanity eccl    isa   this fair  no newerected business but  thing  ancient standing i  show you  original  it almost five thousand years agone there  pilgrims walking   celestial city  these two honest persons are  beelzebub apollyon  legion  their companions perceiving   path   pilgrims made  their way   city lay through this town  vanity they contrived here  set up  fair  fair wherein should  sold all sorts  vanity    should last all  year long therefore  this fair  all such merchandise sold  houses lands trades places honours preferments titles countries kingdoms lusts pleasures  delights  all sorts  whores bawds wives husbands children masters servants lives blood bodies souls silver gold pearls precious stones  what not and moreover  this fair there   all times   seen juggling cheats games plays fools apes knaves  rogues    every kind here    seen too    nothing thefts murders adulteries false swearers     bloodred colour  and   other fairs  less moment there   several rows  streets under their proper names where such  such wares  vended so here likewise you have  proper places rows streets viz countries  kingdoms where  wares  this fair  soonest   found here   britain row  french row  italian row  spanish row  german row where several sorts  vanities    sold but   other fairs some one commodity    chief  all  fair so  ware  rome  her merchandise  greatly promoted  this fair only our english nation  some others have taken  dislike thereat  now  i said  way   celestial city lies just through this town where this lusty fair  kept     go   city  yet not go through this town must needs go out   world  cor  the prince  princes himself when here went through this town  his own country   upon  fair day too yea   i think   beelzebub  chief lord  this fair  invited him  buy  his vanities yea would have made him lord   fair would  but have done him reverence   went through  town matt  luke  yea because   such  person  honour beelzebub had him  street  street  showed him all  kingdoms   world   little time   might if possible allure  blessed one  cheapen  buy some  his vanities but  had no mind   merchandise  therefore left  town without laying out so much  one farthing upon these vanities this fair therefore   ancient thing  long standing   very great fair  now these pilgrims  i said must needs go through this fair well so they did but behold even  they entered into  fair all  people   fair  moved   town itself      hubbub about them    several reasons for  first the pilgrims  clothed  such kind  raiment   diverse   raiment  any  traded   fair the people therefore   fair made  great gazing upon them some said they  fools some they  bedlams  some they  outlandish men  cor   secondly and  they wondered  their apparel so they did likewise  their speech  few could understand what they said they naturally spoke  language  canaan but they  kept  fair   men  this world so that  one end   fair   other they seemed barbarians each   other  thirdly but  which did not  little amuse  merchandisers was  these pilgrims set very light  all their wares they cared not so much   look upon them  if they called upon them  buy they would put their fingers  their ears  cry turn away mine eyes  beholding vanity  look upwards signifying  their trade  traffic   heaven ps  phil   one chanced mockingly beholding  carriage   men  say unto them what  ye buy but they looking gravely upon him answered we buy  truth prov  at  there   occasion taken  despise  men  more some mocking some taunting some speaking reproachfully  some calling upon others  smite them at last things came   hubbub  great stir   fair insomuch  all order  confounded now  word presently brought   great one   fair who quickly came down  deputed some  his most trusty friends  take these men into examination about whom  fair  almost overturned so  men  brought  examination  they  sat upon them asked them whence they came whither they went  what they did there  such  unusual garb the men told them  they  pilgrims  strangers   world   they  going  their own country which   heavenly jerusalem heb    they had given no occasion   men   town nor yet   merchandisers thus  abuse them   let them  their journey except    that when one asked them what they would buy they said they would buy  truth but they   appointed  examine them did not believe them   any other than bedlams  mad or else such  came  put all things into  confusion   fair therefore they took them  beat them  besmeared them  dirt  then put them into  cage  they might  made  spectacle  all  men   fair behold vanity fair  pilgrims there are chaind  stand beside even so   our lord passd here and  mount calvary died  there therefore they lay  some time   made  objects  any mans sport or malice or revenge  great one   fair laughing still  all  befell them but  men being patient  not rendering railing  railing but contrariwise blessing  good words  bad  kindness  injuries done some men   fair   more observing  less prejudiced than  rest began  check  blame  baser sort  their continual abuses done  them   men they therefore  angry manner let fly  them again counting them  bad   men   cage  telling them  they seemed confederates  should  made partakers  their misfortunes the other replied that  aught they could see  men  quiet  sober  intended nobody any harm   there  many  traded  their fair   more worthy   put into  cage yea  pillory too than   men they had abused thus after divers words had passed  both sides  men behaving themselves all  while very wisely  soberly before them they fell  some blows among themselves  did harm one  another then  these two poor men brought before their examiners again  there charged  being guilty   late hubbub  had been   fair so they beat them pitifully  hanged irons upon them  led them  chains up  down  fair   example   terror  others lest any should speak  their behalf or join themselves unto them but christian  faithful behaved themselves yet more wisely  received  ignominy  shame   cast upon them  so much meekness  patience   won  their side though but few  comparison   rest several   men   fair this put  other party yet into greater rage insomuch  they concluded  death  these two men wherefore they threatened   cage nor irons should serve their turn but  they should die   abuse they had done   deluding  men   fair then  they remanded   cage again until further order should  taken  them so they put them in  made their feet fast   stocks  here therefore they called again  mind what they had heard  their faithful friend evangelist    more confirmed  their way  sufferings  what  told them would happen  them they also now comforted each other  whose lot    suffer even  should have  best  it therefore each man secretly wished   might have  preferment but committing themselves   allwise disposal  him  ruleth all things  much content they abode   condition  which they were until they should  otherwise disposed of  then  convenient time being appointed they brought them forth  their trial  order  their condemnation when  time  come they  brought before their enemies  arraigned the judges name  lord hategood their indictment  one   same  substance though somewhat varying  form  contents whereof  this  that they  enemies   disturbers  their trade  they had made commotions  divisions   town  had won  party  their own most dangerous opinions  contempt   law  their prince now faithful play  man speak  thy god fear not  wickeds malice nor their rod speak boldly man  truth   thy side die  it   life  triumph ride  faithfuls answer  himself then faithful began  answer   had only set himself against  which hath set itself against him   higher than  highest and said he   disturbance i make none being myself  man  peace  parties   won  us  won  beholding our truth  innocence  they  only turned   worse   better and    king you talk of since   beelzebub  enemy  our lord i defy him  all his angels  then proclamation  made  they  had aught  say  their lord  king against  prisoner   bar should forthwith appear  give  their evidence so there came  three witnesses  wit envy superstition  pickthank they  then asked if they knew  prisoner   bar  what they had  say  their lord  king against him  then stood forth envy  said  this effect my lord i have known this man  long time   attest upon my oath before this honourable bench   is judge hold give him his oath so they sware him then  said envy my lord this man notwithstanding his plausible name  one   vilest men  our country he neither regardeth prince nor people law nor custom but doth all   can  possess all men  certain  his disloyal notions which    general calls principles  faith  holiness and  particular i heard him once myself affirm  christianity   customs  our town  vanity  diametrically opposite  could not  reconciled by which saying my lord  doth  once not only condemn all our laudable doings but us   doing  them judge then did  judge say  him hast thou any more  say envy my lord i could say much more only i would not  tedious   court yet if need be when  other gentlemen have given  their evidence rather than anything shall  wanting   despatch him i  enlarge my testimony against him so   bid  stand by then they called superstition  bid him look upon  prisoner they also asked what  could say  their lord  king against him then they sware him so  began  super my lord i have no great acquaintance  this man nor do i desire  have further knowledge  him however this i know     very pestilent fellow  some discourse that  other day i had  him  this town  then talking  him i heard him say  our religion  naught  such  which  man could  no means please god which sayings  his my lord your lordship very well knows what necessarily thence  follow  wit  we do still worship  vain  yet  our sins  finally shall  damned  this   which i have  say  then  pickthank sworn  bid say what  knew  behalf  their lord  king against  prisoner   bar pickthanks testimony pick my lord  you gentlemen all this fellow i have known   long time  have heard him speak things  ought not   spoke   hath railed  our noble prince beelzebub  hath spoken contemptibly  his honourable friends whose names   lord old man  lord carnal delight  lord luxurious  lord desire  vain glory my old lord lechery sir having greedy  all  rest  our nobility   hath said moreover that if all men   his mind if possible there  not one  these noblemen should have any longer  being  this town besides  hath not been afraid  rail  you my lord who  now appointed   his judge calling you  ungodly villain  many other such like vilifying terms  which  hath bespattered most   gentry  our town  when this pickthank had told his tale  judge directed his speech   prisoner   bar saying thou runagate heretic  traitor hast thou heard what these honest gentlemen have witnessed against thee faith may i speak  few words  my own defence judge sirrah sirrah thou deservest  live no longer but   slain immediately upon  place yet  all men may see our gentleness towards thee let us hear what thou vile runagate hast  say  faithfuls defence  himself faith  i say then  answer  what mr envy hath spoken i never said aught but this that what rule or laws or customs or people  flat against  word  god  diametrically opposite  christianity if i have said amiss  this convince me  my error  i am ready here before you  make my recantation   as   second  wit mr superstition  his charge against me i said only this that   worship  god there  required  divine faith but there can  no divine faith without  divine revelation     god therefore whatever  thrust into  worship  god   not agreeable  divine revelation cannot  done but   human faith which faith  not  profitable  eternal life   as  what mr pickthank hath said i say avoiding terms   i am said  rail   like   prince  this town  all  rabblement his attendants  this gentleman named  more fit   being  hell than  this town  country  so  lord have mercy upon me  then  judge called   jury who all this while stood by  hear  observe gentlemen   jury you see this man about whom so great  uproar hath been made  this town you have also heard what these worthy gentlemen have witnessed against him also you have heard his reply  confession it lieth now  your breasts  hang him or save his life but yet i think meet  instruct you into our law  there   act made   days  pharaoh  great servant  our prince  lest those   contrary religion should multiply  grow too strong  him their males should  thrown into  river exo  there  also  act made   days  nebuchadnezzar  great another  his servants  whosoever would not fall down  worship his golden image should  thrown into  fiery furnace dan  there  also  act made   days  darius  whoso  some time called upon any god but him should  cast into  lions den dan  now  substance  these laws this rebel  broken not only  thought which  not   borne but also  word  deed which must therefore needs  intolerable  for   pharaoh his law  made upon  supposition  prevent mischief no crime being yet apparent but here   crime apparent for  second  third you see  disputeth against our religion    treason  hath confessed  deserveth  die  death  then went  jury out whose names were mr blindman mr nogood mr malice mr lovelust mr liveloose mr heady mr highmind mr enmity mr liar mr cruelty mr hatelight  mr implacable who every one gave  his private verdict against him among themselves  afterwards unanimously concluded  bring him  guilty before  judge and first among themselves mr blindman  foreman said i see clearly  this man   heretic then said mr nogood away  such  fellow   earth ay said mr malice  i hate  very looks  him then said mr lovelust i could never endure him nor i said mr liveloose   would always  condemning my way hang him hang him said mr heady a sorry scrub said mr highmind my heart riseth against him said mr enmity he   rogue said mr liar hanging  too good  him said mr cruelty let us despatch him out   way said mr hatelight then said mr implacable might i have all  world given me i could not  reconciled  him therefore let us forthwith bring him  guilty  death and so they did therefore   presently condemned   had   place where  was   place  whence  came  there   put   most cruel death  could  invented  they therefore brought him out  do  him according  their law and first they scourged him then they buffeted him then they lanced his flesh  knives after that they stoned him  stones then pricked him  their swords and last  all they burned him  ashes   stake thus came faithful  his end  now i saw  there stood behind  multitude  chariot   couple  horses waiting  faithful who so soon  his adversaries had despatched him  taken up into it  straightway  carried up through  clouds  sound  trumpet  nearest way   celestial gate brave faithful bravely done  word  deed judge witnesses  jury have instead of overcoming thee but shown their rage when they  dead thoult live  age  age in  new heaven  new earth footnote  one edition  but   christian  had some respite   remanded back  prison so  there remained   space but he  overrules all things having  power  their rage  his own hand so wrought  about  christian   time escaped them  went his way and   went  sang saying well faithful thou hast faithfully profest unto thy lord  whom thou shalt  blest when faithless ones  all their vain delights are crying out under their hellish plights sing faithful sing  let thy name survive for though they killd thee thou art yet alive  now i saw  my dream  christian went not forth alone  there  one whose name  hopeful being made so   beholding  christian  faithful  their words  behaviour  their sufferings   fair who joined himself unto him and entering into  brotherly covenant told him   would  his companion thus one died  bear testimony   truth  another rises out  his ashes    companion  christian  his pilgrimage this hopeful also told christian  there  many more   men   fair  would take their time  follow after  so i saw  quickly after they  got out   fair they overtook one   going before them whose name  byends so they said  him what countryman sir  how far go you this way he told them   came   town  fairspeech    going   celestial city but told them not his name from fairspeech said christian is there any good  lives there prov  byends yes said byends i hope chr pray sir what may i call you said christian byends i am  stranger  you  you  me if you  going this way i shall  glad  your company if not i must  content chr this town  fairspeech said christian i have heard of and  i remember they say    wealthy place byends yes i  assure you   is  i have very many rich kindred there  chr pray who  your kindred there if  man may  so bold byends almost  whole town   particular my lord turnabout my lord timeserver my lord fairspeech from whose ancestors  town first took  name also mr smoothman mr facingbothways mr anything   parson  our parish mr twotongues  my mothers own brother  fathers side   tell you  truth i am become  gentleman  good quality yet my greatgrandfather  but  waterman looking one way  rowing another  i got most  my estate   same occupation chr are you  married man byends yes  my wife   very virtuous woman  daughter   virtuous woman she  my lady feignings daughter therefore she came   very honourable family   arrived  such  pitch  breeding  she knows how  carry   all even  prince  peasant it  true we somewhat differ  religion  those   stricter sort yet but  two small points first we never strive against wind  tide secondly we  always most zealous when religion goes  his silver slippers we love much  walk  him   street if  sun shines   people applaud him  then christian stepped  little aside  his fellow hopeful saying it runs  my mind  this  one byends  fairspeech  if   he we have  very  knave  our company  dwelleth  all these parts then said hopeful ask him methinks  should not  ashamed  his name so christian came up  him again  said sir you talk  if you knew something more than all  world doth  if i take not my mark amiss i deem i have half  guess  you is not your name mr byends  fairspeech byends this  not my name but indeed    nickname   given me  some  cannot abide me  i must  content  bear    reproach  other good men have borne theirs before me  chr but did you never give  occasion  men  call you  this name byends never never the worst  ever i did  give them  occasion  give me this name was  i had always  luck  jump  my judgment   present way   times whatever  was  my chance   get thereby but if things  thus cast upon me let me count them  blessing but let not  malicious load me therefore  reproach  chr i thought indeed  you   man  i heard of   tell you what i think i fear this name belongs  you more properly than you  willing we should think  doth byends well if you  thus imagine i cannot help it you shall find me  fair companykeeper if you  still admit me your associate chr if you  go  us you must go against wind  tide  which i perceive  against your opinion you must also own religion  his rags  well  when  his silver slippers  stand  him too when bound  irons  well  when  walketh  streets  applause byends you must not impose nor lord  over my faith leave me  my liberty  let me go  you chr not  step further unless you  do  what i propound  we then said byends i shall never desert my old principles since they  harmless  profitable if i may not go  you i must do  i did before you overtook me even go  myself until some overtake me    glad  my company  now i saw  my dream  christian  hopeful forsook him  kept their distance before him but one  them looking back saw three men following mr byends  behold  they came up  him  made them  very low conge conge  they also gave him  compliment the mens names  mr holdtheworld mr moneylove  mr saveall men  mr byends had formerly been acquainted with   their minority they  schoolfellows   taught  one mr gripeman  schoolmaster  lovegain which   market town   county  coveting   north this schoolmaster taught them  art  getting either  violence cozenage flattery lying or  putting   guise  religion  these four gentlemen had attained much   art  their master so  they could each  them have kept such  school themselves  well when they had  i said thus saluted each other mr moneylove said  mr byends who  they upon  road before us for christian  hopeful  yet within view byends character   pilgrims byends they   couple  far countrymen that after their mode  going  pilgrimage moneylove alas why did they not stay  we might have had their good company  they  we  you sir i hope  all going  pilgrimage byends we  so indeed but  men before us  so rigid  love so much their own notions  do also so lightly esteem  opinions  others  let  man  never so godly yet if  jumps not  them  all things they thrust him quite out  their company  saveall that  bad but we read  some   righteous overmuch  such mens rigidness prevails  them  judge  condemn all but themselves but i pray what  how many   things wherein you differed byends why they after their headstrong manner conclude    duty  rush  their journey all weathers  i am  waiting  wind  tide they   hazarding all  god   clap  i am  taking all advantages  secure my life  estate they   holding their notions though all other men  against them but i am  religion  what  so far   times  my safety  bear it they   religion when  rags  contempt but i am  him when  walks  his golden slippers   sunshine   applause  holdtheworld ay  hold you there still good mr byends for  my part i can count him but  fool that having  liberty  keep what  has shall  so unwise   lose it let us  wise  serpents   best  make hay when  sun shines you see how  bee lieth still all winter  bestirs her only when she can have profit  pleasure god sends sometimes rain  sometimes sunshine if they  such fools  go through  first yet let us  content  take fair weather along  us for my part i like  religion best   stand   security  gods good blessings unto us  who can imagine   ruled  his reason since god  bestowed upon us  good things  this life but   would have us keep them  his sake abraham  solomon grew rich  religion and job says   good man shall lay up gold  dust but  must not  such   men before us if they   you have described them saveall i think  we  all agreed  this matter  therefore there needs no more words about it moneylove no there needs no more words about this matter indeed    believes neither scripture nor reason and you see we have both  our side neither knows his own liberty nor seeks his own safety  byends my brethren we are  you see going all  pilgrimage and  our better diversion  things   bad give me leave  propound unto you this question suppose  man  minister or  tradesman c should have  advantage lie before him  get  good blessings  this life yet so    can  no means come  them except  appearance  least  becomes extraordinarily zealous  some points  religion   meddled not  before may  not use these means  attain his end  yet   right honest man  moneylove i see  bottom  your question and  these gentlemens good leave i  endeavour  shape you  answer and first  speak  your question   concerns  minister himself suppose  minister  worthy man possessed but   very small benefice    his eye  greater more fat  plump  far   also now  opportunity  getting  it yet so   being more studious  preaching more frequently  zealously and because  temper   people requires it  altering  some  his principles  my part i see no reason but  man may do this provided    call ay  more  great deal besides  yet   honest man for why   his desire   greater benefice  lawful this cannot  contradicted since   set before him  providence so then  may get it if  can making no question  conscience sake   besides his desire after  benefice makes him more studious  more zealous preacher c  so makes him  better man yea makes him better improve his parts which  according   mind  god   now   his complying   temper  his people  dissenting  serve them some  his principles this argueth  that     selfdenying temper  of  sweet  winning deportment  so  more fit   ministerial function   i conclude then   minister  changes  small   great should not  so doing  judged  covetous but rather since   improved  his parts  industry thereby  counted  one  pursues his call   opportunity put into his hands  do good  and now   second part   question which concerns  tradesman you mentioned suppose such  one  have but  poor employ   world but  becoming religious  may mend his market perhaps get  rich wife or more  far better customers  his shop  my part i see no reason but  this may  lawfully done for why  to become religious   virtue  what means soever  man becomes so  nor   unlawful  get  rich wife or more custom  my shop  besides  man  gets these  becoming religious gets  which  good  them   good  becoming good himself so then here   good wife  good customers  good gain  all these  becoming religious which  good therefore  become religious  get all these   good  profitable design  this answer thus made  this mr moneylove  mr byendss question  highly applauded  them all wherefore they concluded upon  whole    most wholesome  advantageous and because  they thought no man  able  contradict it  because christian  hopeful  yet within call they jointly agreed  assault them   question  soon  they overtook them   rather because they had opposed mr byends before so they called after them  they stopped  stood still till they came up  them but they concluded  they went  not mr byends but old mr holdtheworld should propound  question  them because  they supposed their answer  him would  without  remainder   heat   kindled betwixt mr byends  them  their parting  little before  so they came up  each other  after  short salutation mr holdtheworld propounded  question  christian  his fellow  bid them  answer  if they could chr then said christian even  babe  religion may answer ten thousand such questions for if   unlawful  follow christ  loaves as     sixth  john how much more abominable    make  him  religion  stalkinghorse  get  enjoy  world nor do we find any other than heathens hypocrites devils  witches    this opinion   heathens  when hamor  shechem had  mind   daughter  cattle  jacob  saw  there  no way  them  come  them but  becoming circumcised they say  their companions if every male  us  circumcised  they  circumcised shall not their cattle  their substance  every beast  theirs  ours their daughter  their cattle   which they sought  obtain  their religion  stalkinghorse they made use   come  them read  whole story gen    the hypocritical pharisees  also  this religion long prayers  their pretence but  get widows houses  their intent  greater damnation   god their judgment luke    judas  devil  also  this religion   religious   bag   might  possessed  what  therein but   lost cast away   very son  perdition   simon  witch   this religion too   would have had  holy ghost   might have got money therewith  his sentence  peters mouth  according acts    neither   out  my mind but   man  takes up religion   world  throw away religion   world  so surely  judas resigned  world  becoming religious so surely did  also sell religion  his master   same to answer  question therefore affirmatively  i perceive you have done   accept of  authentic such answer  both heathenish hypocritical  devilish  your reward   according  your works then they stood staring one upon another but had not wherewith  answer christian hopeful also approved   soundness  christians answer so there   great silence among them mr byends  his company also staggered  kept behind  christian  hopeful might outgo them then said christian  his fellow if these men cannot stand before  sentence  men what  they do   sentence  god and if they  mute when dealt   vessels  clay what  they do when they shall  rebuked   flames   devouring fire  then christian  hopeful outwent them again  went till they came   delicate plain called ease where they went  much content but  plain  but narrow so they  quickly got over it now   further side   plain   little hill called lucre    hill  silver mine which some  them  had formerly gone  way because   rarity  it had turned aside  see but going too near  brink   pit  ground being deceitful under them broke  they  slain some also had been maimed there  could not  their dying day  their own men again  then i saw  my dream   little off  road over against  silver mine stood demas gentlemanlike  call  passengers  come  see who said  christian  his fellow ho turn aside hither  i  show you  thing chr what thing so deserving   turn us out   way  see it demas here   silver mine  some digging    treasure if you  come   little pains you may richly provide  yourselves  hope then said hopeful let us go see chr not i said christian i have heard  this place before now  how many have there been slain  besides that treasure   snare  those  seek it   hindereth them  their pilgrimage then christian called  demas saying is not  place dangerous hath  not hindered many  their pilgrimage hos  demas not very dangerous except  those   careless but withal  blushed   spake chr then said christian  hopeful let us not stir  step but still keep  our way hope i  warrant you when byends comes up if  hath  same invitation  we   turn  thither  see chr no doubt thereof  his principles lead him  way   hundred  one but  dies there demas then demas called again saying but  you not come over  see  chr then christian roundly answered saying demas thou art  enemy   right ways   lord  this way  hast been already condemned  thine own turning aside  one  his majestys judges  tim   why seekest thou  bring us into  like condemnation besides if we  all turn aside our lord  king  certainly hear thereof   there put us  shame where we would stand  boldness before him demas cried again   also  one  their fraternity   if they would tarry  little  also himself would walk  them  chr then said christian what  thy name is  not  same   which i have called thee demas yes my name  demas i am  son  abraham chr i know you gehazi  your greatgrandfather  judas your father  you have trod  their steps  kings  matt   it  but  devilish prank  thou usest thy father  hanged   traitor  thou deservest no better reward assure thyself  when we come   king we  do him word  this thy behaviour thus they went their way  by this time byends  his companions  come again within sight  they   first beck went over  demas now whether they fell into  pit  looking over  brink thereof or whether they went down  dig or whether they  smothered   bottom   damps  commonly arise  these things i am not certain but this i observed  they never  seen again   way then sang christian byends  silver demas both agree one calls  other runs   may  a sharer  his lucre so these do take up  this world  no further go  now i saw that just   other side  this plain  pilgrims came   place where stood  old monument hard   highway side   sight  which they  both concerned because   strangeness   form thereof   seemed  them  if  had been  woman transformed into  shape   pillar here therefore they stood looking  looking upon it but could not   time tell what they should make thereof at last hopeful espied written above  head thereof  writing   unusual hand but  being no scholar called  christian for   learned  see if  could pick out  meaning so  came  after  little laying  letters together  found  same   this remember lots wife so  read   his fellow after which they both concluded     pillar  salt into which lots wife  turned  her looking back   covetous heart when she  going  sodom  safety gen  which sudden  amazing sight gave them occasion  this discourse  chr ah my brother this   seasonable sight  came opportunely  us after  invitation which demas gave us  come over  view  hill lucre  had we gone over   desired us   thou wast inclining  do my brother we had  aught i know been made ourselves like this woman  spectacle  those  shall come after  behold hope i am sorry  i  so foolish  am made  wonder  i am not now  lots wife  wherein   difference betwixt her sin  mine she only looked back  i had  desire  go see let grace  adored  let me  ashamed  ever such  thing should   mine heart  chr let us take notice  what we see here  our help  time  come this woman escaped one judgment  she fell not   destruction  sodom yet she  destroyed  another  we see she  turned into  pillar  salt hope true  she may   us both caution  example caution  we should shun her sin or  sign  what judgment  overtake such  shall not  prevented  this caution so korah dathan  abiram   two hundred  fifty men  perished  their sin did also become  sign or example  others  beware num  but above all i muse  one thing  wit how demas  his fellows can stand so confidently yonder  look   treasure which this woman but  looking behind her after for we read not  she stepped one foot out   way  turned into  pillar  salt especially since  judgment which overtook her did make her  example within sight  where they are  they cannot choose but see her did they but lift up their eyes  chr it   thing   wondered at   argueth  their hearts  grown desperate   case  i cannot tell who  compare them  so fitly   them  pick pockets   presence   judge or   cut purses under  gallows it  said   men  sodom  they  sinners exceedingly because they  sinners before  lord  is  his eyesight  notwithstanding  kindnesses   had showed them gen    land  sodom  now like  garden  eden heretofore gen  this therefore provoked him  more  jealousy  made their plague  hot   fire   lord out  heaven could make it and   most rationally   concluded  such even such  these are  shall sin   sight yea   too  despite  such examples   set continually before them  caution them   contrary must  partakers  severest judgments hope doubtless thou hast said  truth but what  mercy  it  neither thou but especially i am not made myself this example this ministereth occasion  us  thank god  fear before him  always  remember lots wife  i saw then  they went  their way   pleasant river which david  king called the river  god but john the river   water  life ps  rev  ezek  now their way lay just upon  bank   river here therefore christian  his companion walked  great delight they drank also   water   river which  pleasant  enlivening  their weary spirits besides   banks  this river  either side  green trees  bore all manner  fruit   leaves   trees  good  medicine   fruit  these trees they  also much delighted   leaves they eat  prevent surfeits  other diseases   incident  those  heat their blood  travels on either side   river  also  meadow curiously beautified  lilies    green all  year long in this meadow they lay down  slept  here they might lie down safely when they awoke they gathered again   fruit   trees  drank again   water   river  then lay down again  sleep ps  isa  thus they did several days  nights then they sang behold ye how these crystal streams do glide to comfort pilgrims   highway side the meadows green beside their fragrant smell yield dainties  them    can tell what pleasant fruit yea leaves these trees do yield will soon sell all   may buy this field so when they  disposed  go on for they  not  yet  their journeys end they ate  drank  departed  now i beheld  my dream  they had not journeyed far but  river   way   time parted  which they  not  little sorry yet they durst not go out   way now  way   river  rough  their feet tender  reason  their travels so  souls   pilgrims  much discouraged because   way num  wherefore still  they went on they wished  better way now  little before them there    left hand   road  meadow   stile  go over into it   meadow  called bypath meadow then said christian  his fellow if this meadow lieth along  our wayside let us go over into it then  went   stile  see  behold  path lay along   way   other side   fence it  according  my wish said christian here   easiest going come good hopeful  let us go over  hope but how if this path should lead us out   way chr that  not like said  other look doth  not go along   wayside so hopeful being persuaded  his fellow went after him over  stile when they  gone over   got into  path they found  very easy  their feet  withal they looking before them espied  man walking  they did and his name  vainconfidence so they called after him  asked him whither  way led he said to  celestial gate look said christian did not i tell you so by this you may see we  right so they followed   went before them but behold  night came on   grew very dark so  they   behind lost  sight  him  went before  he therefore  went before vainconfidence  name not seeing  way before him fell into  deep pit isa  which   purpose there made   prince  those grounds  catch vainglorious fools withal   dashed  pieces  his fall  now christian  his fellow heard him fall so they called  know  matter but there  none  answer only they heard  groaning then said hopeful where  we now then  his fellow silent  mistrusting   had led him out   way  now  began  rain  thunder  lighten   very dreadful manner   water rose amain then hopeful groaned  himself saying oh  i had kept  my way  chr who could have thought  this path should have led us out   way hope i  afraid     very first  therefore gave you  gentle caution i would have spoken plainer but  you  older than i christians repentance  leading  his brother out   way chr good brother  not offended i am sorry i have brought thee out   way   i have put thee into such imminent danger pray my brother forgive me i did not do    evil intent hope be comforted my brother  i forgive thee  believe too  this shall   our good chr i am glad i have  me  merciful brother but we must not stand thus let us try  go back again hope but good brother let me go before chr no if you please let me go first  if there  any danger i may  first therein because  my means we  both gone out   way  hope no said hopeful you shall not go first  your mind being troubled may lead you out   way again then  their encouragement they heard  voice  one saying set thine heart toward  highway even  way which thou wentest turn again jer  but  this time  waters  greatly risen  reason  which  way  going back  very dangerous then i thought    easier going out   way when we  in than going  when we  out yet they adventured  go back but   so dark   flood  so high   their going back they had like  have been drowned nine or ten times  neither could they  all  skill they had get again   stile  night wherefore  last lighting under  little shelter they sat down there until  daybreak but being weary they fell asleep now there was not far   place where they lay  castle called doubting castle  owner whereof  giant despair     his grounds they now  sleeping wherefore he getting up   morning early  walking up  down  his fields caught christian  hopeful asleep  his grounds then   grim  surly voice  bid them awake  asked them whence they were  what they did  his grounds they told him they  pilgrims   they had lost their way then said  giant you have this night trespassed  me  trampling   lying  my grounds  therefore you must go along  me so they  forced  go because   stronger than they they also had but little  say  they knew themselves   fault the giant therefore drove them before him  put them into his castle into  very dark dungeon nasty  stinking   spirits  these two men ps  here then they lay  wednesday morning till saturday night without one bit  bread or drop  drink or light or any  ask how they did they were therefore here  evil case   far  friends  acquaintance now  this place christian had double sorrow because   through his unadvised counsel  they  brought into this distress the pilgrims now  gratify  flesh will seek  ease but oh how they afresh do thereby plunge themselves new griefs into who seek  please  flesh themselves undo  now giant despair had  wife  her name  diffidence so when   gone  bed  told his wife what  had done  wit   had taken  couple  prisoners  cast them into his dungeon  trespassing  his grounds then  asked her also what  had best  do further  them so she asked him what they were whence they came  whither they  bound   told her then she counselled him  when  arose   morning  should beat them without any mercy so when  arose  getteth him  grievous crabtree cudgel  goes down into  dungeon  them  there first falls  rating  them  if they  dogs although they never gave him  word  distaste then  falls upon them  beats them fearfully  such sort  they  not able  help themselves or  turn them upon  floor this done  withdraws  leaves them there  condole their misery   mourn under their distress so all  day they spent  time  nothing but sighs  bitter lamentations the next night she talking  her husband about them further  understanding they  yet alive did advise him  counsel them  make away themselves so when morning  come  goes  them   surly manner  before  perceiving them   very sore   stripes   had given them  day before  told them  since they  never like  come out   place their only way would  forthwith  make  end  themselves either  knife halter or poison  why said he should you choose life seeing   attended  so much bitterness but they desired him  let them go with   looked ugly upon them and rushing  them had doubtless made  end  them himself but   fell into one  his fits for  sometimes  sunshiny weather fell into fits  lost   time  use  his hand wherefore  withdrew  left them  before  consider what  do then did  prisoners consult between themselves whether   best  take his counsel or no  thus they began  discourse  chr brother said christian what shall we do the life  we now live  miserable for my part i know not whether  best  live thus or  die out  hand my soul chooseth strangling rather than life   grave  more easy  me than this dungeon job  shall we  ruled   giant  hope indeed our present condition  dreadful  death would  far more welcome  me than thus  ever  abide but yet let us consider  lord   country  which we  going hath said thou shalt do no murder no not  another mans person much more then  we forbidden  take his counsel  kill ourselves besides   kills another can but commit murder upon his body but  one  kill himself   kill body  soul  once and moreover my brother thou talkest  ease   grave but hast thou forgotten  hell  certain  murderers go for no murderer hath eternal life c and let us consider again  all  law  not   hand  giant despair others so far  i can understand have been taken  him  well  we  yet have escaped out  his hand who knows but  god  made  world may cause  giant despair may die or that  some time or other  may forget  lock us in or   may   short time have another  his fits before us  may lose  use  his limbs  if ever  should come  pass again  my part i am resolved  pluck up  heart   man   try my utmost  get  under his hand i   fool  i did not try  do  before but however my brother let us  patient  endure  while the time may come  may give us  happy release but let us not  our own murderers with these words hopeful  present did moderate  mind  his brother so they continued together in  dark  day  their sad  doleful condition  well towards evening  giant goes down into  dungeon again  see if his prisoners had taken his counsel but when  came there  found them alive  truly alive  all  now what  want  bread  water   reason   wounds they received when  beat them they could do little but breathe but i say  found them alive  which  fell into  grievous rage  told them that seeing they had disobeyed his counsel  should  worse  them than if they had never been born  at this they trembled greatly  i think  christian fell into  swoon but coming  little  himself again they renewed their discourse about  giants counsel  whether yet they had best  take  or no now christian again seemed    doing it but hopeful made his second reply  followeth  hope my brother said he rememberest thou not how valiant thou hast been heretofore apollyon could not crush thee nor could all  thou didst hear or see or feel   valley   shadow  death what hardship terror  amazement hast thou already gone through and art thou now nothing but fear thou seest  i am   dungeon  thee  far weaker man  nature than thou art also this giant  wounded me  well  thee  hath also cut off  bread  water  my mouth   thee i mourn without  light but let us exercise  little more patience remember how thou playedst  man  vanity fair  wast neither afraid   chain nor cage nor yet  bloody death wherefore let us at least  avoid  shame  becomes not  christian   found in bear up  patience  well  we can  now night being come again   giant  his wife being  bed she asked him concerning  prisoners  if they had taken his counsel to which  replied they  sturdy rogues they choose rather  bear all hardship than  make away themselves then said she take them into  castleyard tomorrow  show them  bones  skulls  those  thou hast already despatched  make them believe ere  week comes   end thou also wilt tear them  pieces  thou hast done their fellows before them  so when  morning  come  giant goes  them again  takes them into  castleyard  shows them  his wife had bidden him these said he  pilgrims  you are once  they trespassed  my grounds  you have done  when i thought fit i tore them  pieces  so within ten days i  do you go get you down  your den again     beat them all  way thither they lay therefore all day  saturday   lamentable case  before now when night  come  when mrs diffidence  her husband  giant  got  bed they began  renew their discourse  their prisoners  withal  old giant wondered   could neither  his blows nor his counsel bring them   end and   his wife replied i fear said she  they live  hope  some  come  relieve them or  they have picklocks about them   means  which they hope  escape and sayest thou so my dear said  giant i will therefore search them   morning  well  saturday about midnight they began  pray  continued  prayer till almost break  day now  little before   day good christian  one half amazed brake out  passionate speech what  fool quoth he am i thus  lie   stinking dungeon when i may  well walk  liberty i have  key  my bosom called promise  will i am persuaded open any lock  doubting castle then said hopeful thats good news good brother pluck  out  thy bosom  try a key  christians bosom called promise opens any lock  doubting castle then christian pulled  out  his bosom  began  try   dungeon door whose bolt as  turned  key gave back   door flew open  ease  christian  hopeful both came out then  went   outward door  leads into  castleyard   his key opened  door also after  went   iron gate   must  opened too but  lock went damnable hard yet  key did open it then they thrust open  gate  make their escape  speed but  gate   opened made such  creaking   waked giant despair who hastily rising  pursue his prisoners felt his limbs  fail  his fits took him again so   could  no means go after them then they went on  came   kings highway again  so  safe because they  out  his jurisdiction  now when they  over  stile they began  contrive  themselves what they should do   stile  prevent those  should come after  falling into  hands  giant despair so they consented  erect there  pillar   engrave upon  side thereof this sentenceover this stile   way  doubting castle which  kept  giant despair who despiseth  king   celestial country  seeks  destroy his holy pilgrims many therefore  followed after read what  written  escaped  danger this done they sang  follows out   way we went  then we found what twas  tread upon forbidden ground and let them  come after have  care lest heedlessness makes them  we  fare lest they  trespassing his prisoners are whose castles doubting  whose names despair  they went then till they came   delectable mountains which mountains belong   lord   hill  which we have spoken before so they went up   mountains  behold  gardens  orchards  vineyards  fountains  water where also they drank  washed themselves  did freely eat   vineyards now there    tops  these mountains shepherds feeding their flocks  they stood   highway side the pilgrims therefore went  them  leaning upon their staves as  common  weary pilgrims when they stand  talk  any   way they asked whose delectable mountains  these and whose   sheep  feed upon them mountains delectable they now ascend where shepherds be which  them do commend alluring things  things  cautious are pilgrims  steady kept  faith  fear  shep these mountains  immanuels land  they  within sight  his city   sheep also  his   laid down his life  them john  chr is this  way   celestial city shep you  just  your way chr how far   thither shep too far  any but those  shall get thither indeed chr is  way safe or dangerous shep safe  those  whom     safe but  transgressors shall fall therein hos  chr is there  this place any relief  pilgrims   weary  faint   way shep the lord  these mountains hath given us  charge not   forgetful  entertain strangers therefore  good   place  before you heb   i saw also  my dream  when  shepherds perceived  they  wayfaring men they also put questions  them  which they made answer   other places as whence came you and how got you into  way and by what means have you so persevered therein for but few  them  begin  come hither do show their face  these mountains but when  shepherds heard their answers being pleased therewith they looked very lovingly upon them  said welcome   delectable mountains  the shepherds i say whose names  knowledge experience watchful  sincere took them   hand  had them  their tents  made them partake   which  ready  present they said moreover we would  ye should stay here awhile   acquainted  us  yet more  solace yourselves   good  these delectable mountains they then told them  they  content  stay so they went  their rest  night because   very late  then i saw  my dream    morning  shepherds called up  christian  hopeful  walk  them upon  mountains so they went forth  them  walked  while having  pleasant prospect  every side then said  shepherds one  another shall we show these pilgrims some wonders so when they had concluded  do it they had them first   top   hill called error which  very steep   furthest side  bid them look down   bottom so christian  hopeful looked down  saw   bottom several men dashed all  pieces   fall  they had   top then said christian what meaneth this the shepherds answered have you not heard  them   made  err  hearkening  hymeneus  philetus  concerning  faith   resurrection   body  tim  they answered yes then said  shepherds those  you see lie dashed  pieces   bottom  this mountain  they  they have continued  this day unburied  you see   example  others  take heed how they clamber too high or how they come too near  brink  this mountain  then i saw  they had them   top  another mountain   name    caution  bid them look afar off which when they did they perceived  they thought several men walking up  down among  tombs   there  they perceived   men  blind because they stumbled sometimes upon  tombs  because they could not get out  among them then said christian what means this  the shepherds then answered did you not see  little below these mountains  stile  led into  meadow   left hand  this way they answered yes then said  shepherds from  stile there goes  path  leads directly  doubting castle which  kept  giant despair  these pointing  them among  tombs came once  pilgrimage  you do now even till they came   same stile  because  right way  rough   place they chose  go out   into  meadow  there  taken  giant despair  cast into doubting castle where after they had been  while kept   dungeon   last did put out their eyes  led them among those tombs where   left them  wander  this very day   saying   wise man might  fulfilled he  wandereth out   way  understanding shall remain   congregation   dead pro  then christian  hopeful looked upon one another  tears gushing out but yet said nothing   shepherds  then i saw  my dream   shepherds had them  another place   bottom where   door   side   hill  they opened  door  bid them look in they looked in therefore  saw  within   very dark  smoky they also thought  they heard there  rumbling noise   fire   cry  some tormented   they smelt  scent  brimstone then said christian what means this the shepherds told them this   byway  hell  way  hypocrites go  at namely such  sell their birthright  esau such  sell their master  judas such  blaspheme  gospel  alexander   lie  dissemble  ananias  sapphira his wife then said hopeful   shepherds i perceive  these had  them even every one  show  pilgrimage  we have now had they not  shep yes  held   long time too hope how far might they go   pilgrimage  their day since they notwithstanding  thus miserably cast away shep some further  some not so far  these mountains then said  pilgrims one  another we have need  cry   strong  strength shep ay  you  have need  use it when you have it too  by this time  pilgrims had  desire  go forward   shepherds  desire they should so they walked together towards  end   mountains then said  shepherds one  another let us here show   pilgrims  gates   celestial city if they have skill  look through our perspective glass the pilgrims then lovingly accepted  motion so they had them   top   high hill called clear  gave them their glass  look  then they essayed  look but  remembrance   last thing   shepherds had shown them made their hands shake  means  which impediment they could not look steadily through  glass yet they thought they saw something like  gate  also some   glory   place then they went away  sang this song thus   shepherds secrets  reveald which  all other men  kept conceald come   shepherds then if you would see things deep things hid   mysterious be  when they  about  depart one   shepherds gave them  note   way another  them bid them beware   flatterer the third bid them take heed  they sleep not upon  enchanted ground and  fourth bid them godspeed so i awoke  my dream  and i slept  dreamed again  saw  same two pilgrims going down  mountains along  highway towards  city now  little below these mountains   left hand lieth  country  conceit  which country there comes into  way  which  pilgrims walked  little crooked lane here therefore they met   very brisk lad  came out   country  his name  ignorance so christian asked him  what parts  came  whither   going  ignor sir i  born   country  lieth off there  little   left hand  i am going   celestial city chr but how do you think  get    gate  you may find some difficulty there ignor as other people do said he chr but what have you  show   gate  may cause   gate should  opened  you ignor i know my lords will  i have been  good liver i pay every man his own i pray fast pay tithes  give alms  have left my country  whither i am going  chr but thou camest not    wicketgate     head  this way thou camest  hither through  same crooked lane  therefore i fear however thou mayest think  thyself when  reckoning day shall come thou wilt have laid  thy charge  thou art  thief   robber instead  getting admittance into  city ignor gentlemen ye  utter strangers  me i know you not  content  follow  religion  your country  i  follow  religion  mine i hope all   well and    gate  you talk of all  world knows     great way off  our country i cannot think  any man  all our parts doth so much  know  way  it nor need they matter whether they do or no since we have  you see  fine pleasant green lane  comes down  our country  next way into  way  when christian saw   man  wise  his own conceit  said  hopeful whisperingly there  more hope   fool than  him prov  and said moreover when     fool walketh   way his wisdom faileth him   saith  every one     fool eccl  what shall we talk further  him or outgo him  present  so leave him  think  what  hath heard already  then stop again  him afterwards  see if  degrees we can do any good  him then said hopeful let ignorance  little while now muse on what  said  let him not refuse good counsel  embrace lest  remain still ignorant  whats  chiefest gain god saith those  no understanding have although  made them them   not save hope he further added it  not good i think  say all  him  once let us pass him by if you will  talk  him anon even    able  bear it  so they both went on  ignorance  came after now when they had passed him  little way they entered into  very dark lane where they met  man whom seven devils had bound  seven strong cords   carrying  him back   door  they saw   side   hill matt  prov  now good christian began  tremble  so did hopeful his companion yet   devils led away  man christian looked  see if  knew him   thought  might  one turnaway  dwelt   town  apostasy but  did not perfectly see his face   did hang his head like  thief   found but being once past hopeful looked after him  espied  his back  paper  this inscription wanton professor  damnable apostate then said christian  his fellow now i call  remembrance  which  told me   thing  happened   good man hereabout the name   man  littlefaith but  good man   dwelt   town  sincere the thing  thisat  entering   this passage there comes down  broadway gate  lane

scrabble  his way this   story  hope but did they take  him all  ever  had chr no  place where his jewels  they never ransacked so those  kept still but  i  told  good man  much afflicted  his loss   thieves got most  his spendingmoney that which they got not as i said  jewels also  had  little odd money left but scarce enough  bring him  his journeys end  peter  nay if i  not misinformed   forced  beg   went  keep himself alive  his jewels  might not sell but beg  do what  could  went as we say  many  hungry belly  most part   rest   way  hope but   not  wonder they got not  him his certificate  which    receive his admittance   celestial gate chr it   wonder but they got not that though they missed  not through any good cunning  his  he being dismayed  their coming upon him had neither power nor skill  hide anything so   more  good providence than  his endeavour  they missed   good thing  hope but  must needs   comfort  him  they got not his jewels  him chr it might have been great comfort  him had  used    should but they  told me  story said   made but little use   all  rest   way   because   dismay   had   taking away his money indeed  forgot   great part   rest  his journey  besides when  any time  came into his mind   began   comforted therewith then would fresh thoughts  his loss come again upon him  those thoughts would swallow up all  peter   hope alas poor man this could not but   great grief  him chr grief ay  grief indeed would  not have been so  any  us had we been used  he   robbed  wounded too     strange place   was it   wonder  did not die

what  lost how   wounded    hardly escaped  his life  hope but    wonder  his necessity did not put him upon selling or pawning some  his jewels   might have wherewith  relieve himself  his journey chr thou talkest like one upon whose head   shell  this very day  what should  pawn them or  whom should  sell them in all  country where   robbed his jewels  not accounted of nor did  want  relief which could  thence  administered  him besides had his jewels been missing   gate   celestial city  had and   knew well enough been excluded   inheritance there   would have been worse  him than  appearance  villainy  ten thousand thieves  hope why art thou so tart my brother esau sold his birthright     mess  pottage   birthright  his greatest jewel  if he why might not littlefaith do so too heb  chr esau did sell his birthright indeed  so do many besides   so doing exclude themselves   chief blessing  also  caitiff did but you must put  difference betwixt esau  littlefaith  also betwixt their estates esaus birthright  typical but littlefaiths jewels  not so esaus belly  his god but littlefaiths belly  not so esaus want lay  his fleshly appetite littlefaiths did not so besides esau could see no further than   fulfilling  his lusts behold i am   point  die said he  what profit shall this birthright do me gen  but littlefaith though   his lot  have but  little faith   his little faith kept  such extravagances  made  see  prize his jewels more than  sell them  esau did his birthright you read not anywhere  esau had faith no not so much   little therefore no marvel if where  flesh only bears sway as     man where no faith   resist if  sells his birthright  his soul  all     devil  hell     such      ass who  her occasions cannot  turned away jer  when their minds  set upon their lusts they  have them whatever they cost but littlefaith   another temper his mind   things divine his livelihood  upon things   spiritual   above therefore  what end should     such  temper sell his jewels had there been any  would have bought them  fill his mind  empty things will  man give  penny  fill his belly  hay or can you persuade  turtledove  live upon carrion like  crow though faithless ones can  carnal lusts pawn or mortgage or sell what they have  themselves outright  boot yet they  have faith saving faith though but  little  it cannot do so here therefore my brother  thy mistake  hope i acknowledge it but yet your severe reflection had almost made me angry chr why i did but compare thee  some   birds     brisker sort who  run   fro  untrodden paths   shell upon their heads but pass  that  consider  matter under debate  all shall  well betwixt thee  me hope but christian these three fellows i am persuaded  my heart  but  company  cowards would they have run else think you  they did   noise  one   coming   road why did not littlefaith pluck up  greater heart he might methinks have stood one brush  them  have yielded when there had been no remedy chr that they  cowards many have said but few have found  so   time  trial as   great heart littlefaith had none  i perceive  thee my brother hadst thou been  man concerned thou art but   brush  then  yield and verily since this   height  thy stomach now they    distance  us should they appear  thee  they did  him they might put thee  second thoughts  but consider again they  but journeymen thieves they serve under  king   bottomless pit who if need be  come into their aid himself  his voice    roaring   lion  pet  i myself have been engaged  this littlefaith was  i found   terrible thing these three villains set upon me  i beginning like  christian  resist they gave but  call   came their master i would   saying is have given my life   penny but that  god would have it i  clothed  armour  proof ay  yet though i  so harnessed i found  hard work  quit myself like  man no man can tell what   combat attends us but   hath been   battle himself  hope well but they ran you see when they did but suppose  one greatgrace    way chr true they have often fled both they  their master when greatgrace hath but appeared  no marvel     kings champion but i trow you  put some difference betwixt littlefaith   kings champion all  kings subjects  not his champions nor can they when tried do such feats  war  he is  meet  think   little child should handle goliath  david did or  there should   strength   ox   wren some  strong some  weak some have great faith some have little this man  one   weak  therefore  went   wall  hope i would  had been greatgrace  their sakes chr if  had been  might have had his hands full  i must tell you  though greatgrace  excellent good  his weapons  has  can so long   keeps them  swords point do well enough  them yet if they get within him even faintheart mistrust or  other  shall go hard but they  throw up his heels and when  man  down you know what can  do  whoso looks well upon greatgraces face shall see those scars  cuts there  shall easily give demonstration  what i say yea once i heard   should say and  when     combat we despaired even  life how did these sturdy rogues  their fellows make david groan mourn  roar yea heman  hezekiah too though champions  their day  forced  bestir them when  these assaulted  yet notwithstanding they had their coats soundly brushed  them peter upon  time would go try what  could do but though some do say  him     prince   apostles they handled him so  they made him  last afraid   sorry girl  leviathans sturdiness besides their king   their whistle he  never out  hearing  if  any time they  put

they have been foiled nor  tickled   thoughts  our own manhood  such commonly come   worst when tried witness peter  whom i made mention before he would swagger ay  would  would  his vain mind

christian poor littlefaith hast been among  thieves wast robbd remember this whoso believes and gets more faith shall then  victor  over ten thousand else scarce over three  so they went   ignorance followed they went then till they came   place where they saw  way put itself into their way  seemed withal  lie  straight   way which they should go  here they knew not which   two  take  both seemed straight before them therefore here they stood still  consider and  they  thinking about  way behold  man black  flesh but covered   very light robe came  them  asked them why they stood there they answered they  going   celestial city but knew not which  these ways  take follow me said  man   thither  i am going so they followed him   way  but now came into  road which  degrees turned  turned them so   city  they desired  go to that  little time their faces  turned away  it yet they followed him but   by before they  aware  led them both within  compass   net  which they  both so entangled  they knew not what  do     white robe fell off  black mans back then they saw where they were wherefore there they lay crying some time  they could not get themselves out  chr then said christian  his fellow now do i see myself  error did not  shepherds bid us beware   flatterers as   saying   wise man so we have found  this day a man  flattereth his neighbour spreadeth  net  his feet prov  hope they also gave us  note  directions about  way  our more sure finding thereof but therein we have also forgotten  read  have not kept ourselves   paths   destroyer here david  wiser than we for saith he concerning  works  men   word  thy lips i have kept me   paths   destroyer ps  thus they lay bewailing themselves   net at last they espied  shining one coming towards them   whip  small cord  his hand when   come   place where they were  asked them whence they came  what they did there they told him  they  poor pilgrims going  zion but  led out  their way   black man clothed  white who bid us said they follow him    going thither too then said    whip it  flatterer  false apostle  hath transformed himself into  angel  light prov  dan   cor  so  rent  net  let  men out then said   them follow me  i may set you  your way again so  led them back   way which they had left  follow  flatterer then  asked them saying where did you lie  last night they said with  shepherds upon  delectable mountains he asked them then if they had not  those shepherds  note  direction   way they answered yes but did you said he when you    stand pluck out  read your note they answered no he asked them why they said they forgot he asked moreover if  shepherds did not bid them beware   flatterer they answered yes but we did not imagine said they  this finespoken man had been he rom   then i saw  my dream   commanded them  lie down which when they did  chastised them sore  teach them  good way wherein they should walk deut     chastised them  said as many  i love i rebuke  chasten  zealous therefore  repent  chron  rev  this done  bid them go  their way  take good heed   other directions   shepherds so they thanked him  all his kindness  went softly along  right way singing come hither you  walk along  way see how  pilgrims fare  go astray they catched    entangling net cause they good counsel lightly did forget tis true they rescued were but yet you see theyre scourged  boot let this your caution be  now after  while they perceived afar off one coming softly  alone all along  highway  meet them then said christian  his fellow yonder   man  his back towards zion    coming  meet us hope i see him let us take heed  ourselves now lest  should prove  flatterer also so  drew nearer  nearer   last came up unto them his name  atheist   asked them whither they  going chr we  going  mount zion then atheist fell into  very great laughter chr what   meaning  your laughter  atheist i laugh  see what ignorant persons you are  take upon you so tedious  journey  you  like  have nothing but your travel  your pains chr why man do you think we shall not  received atheist received there  no such place  you dream   all this world chr but there    world  come  atheist when i   home  mine own country i heard  you now affirm    hearing went out  see  have been seeking this city this twenty years but find no more   than i did  first day i set out jer  eccl  chr we have both heard  believe  there  such  place   found atheist had not i when  home believed i had not come thus far  seek but finding none and yet i should had there been such  place   found  i have gone  seek  further than you i am going back again   seek  refresh myself   things  i then cast away  hopes   which i now see  not  chr then said christian  hopeful his fellow is  true which this man hath said hopefuls gracious answer hope take heed   one   flatterers remember what  hath cost us once already  our hearkening  such kind  fellows what no mount zion did we not see   delectable mountains  gate   city also  we not now  walk  faith let us go on said hopeful lest  man   whip overtake us again  cor  you should have taught me  lesson which i  round you   ears withal cease my son  hear  instruction  causeth  err   words  knowledge prov  i say my brother cease  hear him  let us believe   saving   soul heb   chr my brother i did not put  question  thee   i doubted   truth  our belief myself but  prove thee   fetch  thee  fruit   honesty  thy heart as  this man i know    blinded   god  this world let thee  i go on knowing  we have belief   truth and no lie    truth  john  hope now do i rejoice  hope   glory  god so they turned away   man  he laughing  them went his way  i saw then  my dream  they went till they came into  certain country whose air naturally tended  make one drowsy if  came  stranger into it and here hopeful began   very dull  heavy  sleep wherefore  said unto christian i do now begin  grow so drowsy  i can scarcely hold up mine eyes let us lie down here  take one nap chr by no means said  other lest sleeping we never awake more hope why my brother sleep  sweet   labouring man we may  refreshed if we take  nap chr do you not remember  one   shepherds bid us beware   enchanted ground he meant    we should beware  sleeping therefore let us not sleep  do others but let us watch   sober  thess   hope i acknowledge myself   fault  had i been here alone i had  sleeping run  danger  death i see   true   wise man saith two  better than one hitherto hath thy company been my mercy  thou shalt have  good reward  thy labour eccl  chr now then said christian  prevent drowsiness  this place let us fall into good discourse hope with all my heart said  other chr where shall we begin hope where god began  us but do you begin if you please chr i  sing you first this song when saints do sleepy grow let them come hither and hear how these two pilgrims talk together yea let them learn  them  any wise thus  keep ope their drowsy slumbring eyes saints fellowship if   managed well keeps them awake    spite  hell  chr then christian began  said i  ask you  question how came you  think  first  so doing  you do now hope do you mean how came i  first  look after  good  my soul chr yes   my meaning hope i continued  great while   delight  those things which  seen  sold  our fair things which i believe now would have had i continued  them still drowned me  perdition  destruction chr what things  they hopefuls life before conversion hope all  treasures  riches   world also i delighted much  rioting revelling drinking swearing lying uncleanness sabbathbreaking  what not  tended  destroy  soul but i found  last  hearing  considering  things   divine which indeed i heard  you  also  beloved faithful   put  death  his faith  good living  vanity fair  the end  these things  death rom  and   these things sake cometh  wrath  god upon  children  disobedience eph  chr and did you presently fall under  power  this conviction  hope no i  not willing presently  know  evil  sin nor  damnation  follows upon  commission  it but endeavoured when my mind  first began   shaken   word  shut mine eyes against  light thereof chr but what   cause  your carrying   thus   first workings  gods blessed spirit upon you  hope the causes were  i  ignorant  this   work  god upon me i never thought that  awakenings  sin god  first begins  conversion   sinner  sin  yet very sweet  my flesh  i  loath  leave it  i could not tell how  part  mine old companions their presence  actions  so desirable unto me  the hours  which convictions  upon me  such troublesome  such heartaffrighting hours  i could not bear no not so much   remembrance  them upon my heart chr then   seems sometimes you got rid  your trouble hope yes verily but  would come into my mind again  then i should   bad nay worse than i  before chr why what    brought your sins  mind again  hope many things as  if i did but meet  good man   streets or  if i have heard any read   bible or  if mine head did begin  ache or  if i  told  some  my neighbours  sick or  if i heard  bell toll  some   dead or  if i thought  dying myself or  if i heard  sudden death happened  others  but especially when i thought  myself  i must quickly come  judgment  chr and could you  any time  ease get off  guilt  sin when  any  these ways  came upon you hope no not i  then they got faster hold  my conscience  then if i did but think  going back  sin though my mind  turned against it  would  double torment  me chr and how did you do then hope i thought i must endeavour  mend my life  else thought i i am sure   damned  chr and did you endeavour  mend hope yes  fled  not only my sins but sinful company too  betook me  religious duties  prayer reading weeping  sin speaking truth  my neighbours c these things did i  many others too much here  relate chr and did you think yourself well then hope yes   while but   last my trouble came tumbling upon me again   over  neck  all my reformations  chr how came  about since you  now reformed hope there  several things brought  upon me especially such sayings  these all our righteousnesses   filthy rags isa  by  works   law shall no flesh  justified gal  when ye shall have done all those things say we  unprofitable luke   many more such like from whence i began  reason  myself thus if all my righteousnesses  filthy rags if   deeds   law no man can  justified  if when we have done all we  yet unprofitable then   but  folly  think  heaven   law i further thought thus if  man runs  hundred pounds into  shopkeepers debt  after  shall pay  all   shall fetch yet if this old debt stands still   book uncrossed    shopkeeper may sue him  cast him into prison till  shall pay  debt chr well  how did you apply this  yourself hope why i thought thus  myself i have  my sins run  great way into gods book   my now reforming  not pay off  score therefore i should think still under all my present amendments but how shall i  freed   damnation  i have brought myself  danger   my former transgressions  chr a very good application but pray go on hope another thing  hath troubled me even since my late amendments is  if i look narrowly into  best  what i do now i still see sin new sin mixing itself   best   i do so  now i am forced  conclude  notwithstanding my former fond conceits  myself  duties i have committed sin enough  one duty  send me  hell though my former life had been faultless chr and what did you do then  hope do i could not tell what  do until i brake my mind  faithful    i  well acquainted and  told me  unless i could obtain  righteousness   man  never had sinned neither mine own nor all  righteousness   world could save me chr and did you think  spake true hope had  told me so when i  pleased  satisfied  mine own amendment i had called him fool  his pains but now since i see mine own infirmity   sin  cleaves  my best performance i have been forced    his opinion  chr but did you think when  first  suggested   you  there  such  man   found  whom  might justly  said   never committed sin hope i must confess  words  first sounded strangely but after  little more talk  company  him i had full conviction about it chr and did you ask him what man this was  how you must  justified  him hope yes   told me    lord jesus  dwelleth   right hand   most high and thus said he you must  justified  him even  trusting  what  hath done  himself   days  his flesh  suffered when  did hang   tree i asked him further how  mans righteousness could    efficacy  justify another before god and  told me    mighty god  did what  did  died  death also not  himself but  me  whom his doings   worthiness  them should  imputed if i believed  him heb  rom  col   pet   chr and what did you do then hope i made my objections against my believing   i thought   not willing  save me chr and what said faithful  you then hope he bid me go  him  see then i said   presumption but  said no  i  invited  come matt  then  gave me  book  jesus his inditing  encourage me  more freely  come   said concerning  book  every jot  tittle thereof stood firmer than heaven  earth matt  then i asked him what i must do when i came   told me i must entreat upon my knees  all my heart  soul  father  reveal him  me ps  dan  jer  then i asked him further how i must make my supplication  him and  said go  thou shalt find him upon  mercyseat where  sits all  year long  give pardon  forgiveness  them  come i told him  i knew not what  say when i came and  bid me say  this effect god  merciful  me  sinner  make me  know  believe  jesus christ  i see  if his righteousness had not been or i have not faith   righteousness i am utterly cast away lord i have heard  thou art  merciful god  hast ordained  thy son jesus christ should   saviour   world  moreover  thou art willing  bestow him upon such  poor sinner  i am and i am  sinner indeed lord take therefore this opportunity  magnify thy grace   salvation  my soul through thy son jesus christ amen exo  lev  num  heb   chr and did you do  you  bidden hope yes over  over  over chr and did  father reveal his son  you hope not   first nor second nor third nor fourth nor fifth no nor   sixth time neither chr what did you do then hope what why i could not tell what  do chr had you not thoughts  leaving off praying hope yes  hundred times twice told chr and what   reason you did not hope i believed    true which had been told me  wit  without  righteousness  this christ all  world could not save me  therefore thought i  myself if i leave off i die  i can but die   throne  grace and withal this came into my mind though  tarry wait  it because   surely come   not tarry heb  so i continued praying until  father showed me his son  chr and how   revealed unto you hope i did not see him  my bodily eyes but   eyes  my understanding eph   thus  was one day i  very sad i think sadder than  any one time  my life  this sadness  through  fresh sight   greatness  vileness  my sins and  i  then looking  nothing but hell   everlasting damnation  my soul suddenly  i thought i saw  lord jesus christ look down  heaven upon me  saying believe   lord jesus christ  thou shalt  saved acts   but i replied lord i am  great  very great sinner and  answered my grace  sufficient  thee  cor then i said but lord what  believing and then i saw   saying he  cometh  me shall never hunger    believeth  me shall never thirst  believing  coming  all one     came  is ran out  his heart  affections after salvation  christ  indeed believed  christ john  then  water stood  mine eyes  i asked further but lord may such  great sinner  i am  indeed accepted  thee   saved  thee and i heard him say and him  cometh  me i   no wise cast out john  then i said but how lord must i consider  thee  my coming  thee  my faith may  placed aright upon thee then  said christ jesus came into  world  save sinners  tim  he   end   law  righteousness  every one  believeth rom  he died  our sins  rose again  our justification rom  he loved us  washed us  our sins  his own blood rev  he  mediator betwixt god  us  tim  he ever liveth  make intercession  us heb  from all which i gathered  i must look  righteousness  his person   satisfaction  my sins  his blood  what  did  obedience  his fathers law   submitting   penalty thereof  not  himself but  him   accept   his salvation   thankful and now  my heart full  joy mine eyes full  tears  mine affections running over  love   name people  ways  jesus christ  chr this   revelation  christ  your soul indeed but tell me particularly what effect this had upon your spirit hope it made me see  all  world notwithstanding all  righteousness thereof    state  condemnation it made me see  god  father though   just can justly justify  coming sinner it made me greatly ashamed   vileness  my former life  confounded me   sense  mine own ignorance  there never came thought into my heart before now  showed me so  beauty  jesus christ it made me love  holy life  long  do something   honour  glory   name   lord jesus yea i thought  had i now  thousand gallons  blood  my body i could spill  all   sake   lord jesus  i saw then  my dream  hopeful looked back  saw ignorance whom they had left behind coming after look said   christian how far yonder youngster loitereth behind chr ay ay i see him  careth not  our company hope but i trow  would not have hurt him had  kept pace  us hitherto chr that  true but i warrant you  thinketh otherwise hope that i think  doth but however let us tarry  him so they did  then christian said  him come away man why do you stay so behind ignor i take my pleasure  walking alone even more  great deal than  company unless i like   better then said christian  hopeful but softly did i not tell you  cared not  our company but however said he come up  let us talk away  time  this solitary place then directing his speech  ignorance  said come how do you how stands  between god  your soul now  ignorances hope   ground   ignor i hope well  i am always full  good motions  come into my mind  comfort me  i walk chr what good motions pray tell us ignor why i think  god  heaven chr so do  devils  damned souls ignor but i think  them  desire them chr so do many   never like  come there the soul   sluggard desireth  hath nothing prov  ignor but i think  them  leave all  them chr that i doubt  leaving all   hard matter yea  harder matter than many  aware of but why or  what art thou persuaded  thou hast left all  god  heaven  ignor my heart tells me so chr the wise man says he  trusts his own heart   fool prov  ignor this  spoken   evil heart but mine   good one chr but how dost thou prove that ignor it comforts me  hopes  heaven chr that may  through  deceitfulness   mans heart may minister comfort  him   hopes   thing  which  yet  no ground  hope ignor but my heart  life agree together  therefore my hope  well grounded chr who told thee  thy heart  life agree together ignor my heart tells me so chr ask my fellow if i   thief thy heart tells thee so except  word  god beareth witness  this matter other testimony   no value  ignor but   not  good heart  hath good thoughts   not   good life   according  gods commandments chr yes    good heart  hath good thoughts     good life   according  gods commandments but   one thing indeed  have these  another thing only  think so ignor pray what count you good thoughts   life according  gods commandments chr there  good thoughts  divers kinds some respecting ourselves some god some christ  some other things ignor what  good thoughts respecting ourselves chr such  agree   word  god  ignor when do our thoughts  ourselves agree   word  god chr when we pass  same judgment upon ourselves which  word passes to explain myselfthe word  god saith  persons   natural condition there  none righteous there  none  doeth good rom  it saith also  every imagination   heart  man  only evil   continually gen  and again the imagination  mans heart  evil  his youth rom  now then when we think thus  ourselves having sense thereof then  our thoughts good ones because according   word  god ignor i  never believe  my heart  thus bad chr therefore thou never hadst one good thought concerning thyself  thy life but let me go on as  word passeth  judgment upon our heart so  passeth  judgment upon our ways  when our thoughts  our hearts  ways agree   judgment which  word giveth  both then  both good because agreeing thereto  ignor make out your meaning chr why  word  god saith  mans ways  crooked ways not good but perverse ps  prov  it saith they  naturally out   good way  they have not known it rom  now when  man thus thinketh  his waysi say when  doth sensibly   hearthumiliation thus think then hath  good thoughts  his own ways because his thoughts now agree   judgment   word  god  ignor what  good thoughts concerning god chr even  i have said concerning ourselves when our thoughts  god do agree  what  word saith  him   is when we think  his being  attributes   word hath taught  which i cannot now discourse  large but  speak  him  reference  us then we have right thoughts  god when we think   knows us better than we know ourselves  can see sin  us when  where we can see none  ourselves when we think  knows our inmost thoughts   our heart  all  depths  always open unto his eyes also when we think  all our righteousness stinks  his nostrils  that therefore  cannot abide  see us stand before him  any confidence even  all our best performances  ignor do you think  i am such  fool   think god can see no further than i or  i would come  god   best  my performances chr why how dost thou think  this matter ignor why   short i think i must believe  christ  justification chr how think thou must believe  christ when thou seest not thy need  him thou neither seest thy original nor actual infirmities but hast such  opinion  thyself   what thou dost  plainly renders thee   one  did never see  necessity  christs personal righteousness  justify thee before god how then dost thou say i believe  christ  ignor i believe well enough  all that chr how dost thou believe ignor i believe  christ died  sinners   i shall  justified before god   curse through his gracious acceptance  my obedience  his law or thus christ makes my duties   religious acceptable  his father  virtue  his merits  so shall i  justified  chr let me give  answer  this confession  thy faith  thou believest   fantastical faith  this faith  nowhere described   word  thou believest   false faith because  taketh justification   personal righteousness  christ  applies   thy own  this faith maketh not christ  justifier  thy person but  thy actions   thy person  thy actions sake which  false  therefore this faith  deceitful even such   leave thee under wrath   day  god almighty  true justifying faith puts  soul  sensible   condition   law upon flying  refuge unto christs righteousness which righteousness  his  not  act  grace  which  maketh  justification thy obedience accepted  god but his personal obedience   law  doing  suffering  us what  required  our hands this righteousness i say true faith accepteth under  skirt  which  soul being shrouded    presented  spotless before god   accepted  acquit  condemnation  ignor what would you have us trust  what christ  his own person  done without us this conceit would loosen  reins  our lust  tolerate us  live  we list  what matter how we live if we may  justified  christs personal righteousness  all when we believe it chr ignorance  thy name   thy name is so art thou even this thy answer demonstrateth what i say ignorant thou art  what justifying righteousness is   ignorant how  secure thy soul through  faith  it   heavy wrath  god yea thou also art ignorant   true effects  saving faith  this righteousness  christ which is  bow  win over  heart  god  christ  love his name his word ways  people  not  thou ignorantly imaginest hope ask him if ever  had christ revealed  him  heaven  ignor what you   man  revelations i believe  what both you  all  rest  you say about  matter  but  fruit  distracted brains hope why man christ  so hid  god   natural apprehensions   flesh   cannot  any man  savingly known unless god  father reveals him  them  ignor that  your faith but not mine yet mine i doubt not   good  yours though i have not  my head so many whimsies  you chr give me leave  put   word you ought not so slightly  speak  this matter  this i  boldly affirm even  my good companion hath done  no man can know jesus christ but   revelation   father matt  yea  faith too  which  soul layeth hold upon christ if   right must  wrought   exceeding greatness  his mighty power  working  which faith i perceive poor ignorance thou art ignorant of  cor  eph  be awakened then see thine own wretchedness  fly   lord jesus   his righteousness which   righteousness  god   himself  god thou shalt  delivered  condemnation  ignor you go so fast i cannot keep pace  you do you go  before i must stay  while behind then they said well ignorance wilt thou yet foolish be to slight good counsel ten times given thee and if thou yet refuse it thou shalt know ere long  evil  thy doing so remember man  time stoop do not fear good counsel taken well saves therefore hear but if thou yet shalt slight it thou wilt  the loser ignorance ill warrant thee then christian addressed thus himself  his fellow chr well come my good hopeful i perceive  thou  i must walk  ourselves again  so i saw  my dream  they went  apace before  ignorance  came hobbling after then said christian  his companion it pities me much  this poor man   certainly go ill  him  last hope alas there  abundance  our town  his condition whole families yea whole streets    pilgrims too  if there  so many  our parts how many think you must there    place where   born chr indeed  word saith he hath blinded their eyes lest they should see c but now we   ourselves what do you think  such men have they  no time think you convictions  sin  so consequently fears  their state  dangerous hope nay do you answer  question yourself  you   elder man chr then i say sometimes as i think they may but they being naturally ignorant understand not  such convictions tend  their good  therefore they do desperately seek  stifle them  presumptuously continue  flatter themselves   way  their own hearts  hope i do believe  you say  fear tends much  mens good   make them right  their beginning  go  pilgrimage chr without all doubt  doth if   right  so says  word the fear   lord   beginning  wisdom prov   job  ps   hope how  you describe right fear chr true or right fear  discovered  three things  by  rise   caused  saving convictions  sin  it driveth  soul  lay fast hold  christ  salvation  it begetteth  continueth   soul  great reverence  god his word  ways keeping  tender  making  afraid  turn  them   right hand or   left  anything  may dishonour god break  peace grieve  spirit or cause  enemy  speak reproachfully hope well said i believe you have said  truth are we now almost got past  enchanted ground chr why art thou weary  this discourse hope no verily but  i would know where we are  chr we have not now above two miles further  go thereon but let us return  our matter now  ignorant know not  such convictions  tend  put them  fear   their good  therefore they seek  stifle them hope how do they seek  stifle them  chr  they think  those fears  wrought   devil though indeed they  wrought  god and thinking so they resist them  things  directly tend  their overthrow  they also think  these fears tend   spoiling  their faith when alas  them poor men  they are they have none  all  therefore they harden their hearts against them  they presume they ought not  fear and therefore  despite  them wax presumptuously confident  they see  those fears tend  take away  them their pitiful old selfholiness  therefore they resist them  all their might  hope i know something  this myself for before i knew myself   so  me chr well we  leave  this time our neighbour ignorance  himself  fall upon another profitable question hope with all my heart but you shall still begin chr well then did you not know about ten years ago one temporary  your parts who   forward man  religion then hope know him yes  dwelt  graceless  town about two miles off  honesty   dwelt next door  one turnback  chr right  dwelt under  same roof  him well  man  much awakened once i believe  then  had some sight  his sins    wages   due thereto hope i am  your mind for my house not being above three miles  him  would ofttimes come  me    many tears truly i pitied  man   not altogether without hope  him but one may see   not every one  cries lord lord chr he told me once    resolved  go  pilgrimage  we do now but all   sudden  grew acquainted  one saveself  then  became  stranger  me  hope now since we  talking about him let us  little inquire into  reason   sudden backsliding  him  such others chr it may  very profitable but do you begin hope well then there   my judgment four reasons  it   though  consciences  such men  awakened yet their minds  not changed therefore when  power  guilt weareth away  which provoked them   religious ceaseth wherefore they naturally turn  their own course again even  we see  dog   sick  what   eaten so long  his sickness prevails  vomits  casts up all not   doth this   free mind if we may say  dog   mind but because  troubleth his stomach but now when his sickness  over  so his stomach eased his desire being not  all alienate  his vomit  turns him about  licks up all  so   true which  written the dog  turned  his own vomit again  pet  thus i say being hot  heaven  virtue only   sense  fear   torments  hell  their sense  hell   fears  damnation chills  cools so their desires  heaven  salvation cool also so then  comes  pass  when their guilt  fear  gone their desires  heaven  happiness die  they return  their course again   another reason is they have slavish fears  do overmaster them i speak now   fears  they have  men  the fear  man bringeth  snare prov  so then though they seem   hot  heaven so long   flames  hell  about their ears yet when  terror   little over they betake themselves  second thoughts namely    good   wise  not  run for they know not what  hazard  losing all or  least  bringing themselves into unavoidable  unnecessary troubles  so they fall    world again   the shame  attends religion lies also   block  their way they  proud  haughty  religion  their eye  low  contemptible therefore when they have lost their sense  hell  wrath  come they return again  their former course   guilt   meditate terror  grievous  them they like not  see their misery before they come into it though perhaps  sight   first if they loved  sight might make them fly whither  righteous fly   safe but because they do  i hinted before even shun  thoughts  guilt  terror therefore when once they  rid  their awakenings about  terrors  wrath  god they harden their hearts gladly  choose such ways   harden them more  more  chr you  pretty near  business   bottom  all   want   change  their mind  will and therefore they  but like  felon  standeth before  judge  quakes  trembles  seems  repent most heartily but  bottom  all   fear   halter not   hath any detestation   offence   evident because let but this man have his liberty      thief  so  rogue still whereas if his mind  changed  would  otherwise  hope now i have showed you  reasons  their going back do you show me  manner thereof chr so i  willingly  they draw off their thoughts all  they may   remembrance  god death  judgment  come  then they cast off  degrees private duties  closet prayer curbing their lusts watching sorrow  sin   like  then they shun  company  lively  warm christians  after  they grow cold  public duty  hearing reading godly conference   like  then they begin  pick holes  we say   coats  some   godly   devilishly  they may have  seeming colour  throw religion for  sake  some infirmity they have espied  them behind their backs  then they begin  adhere to  associate themselves with carnal loose  wanton men  then they give way  carnal  wanton discourses  secret  glad  they if they can see such things  any   counted honest  they may  more boldly do  through their example  after this they begin  play  little sins openly  and then being hardened they show themselves  they are thus being launched again into  gulf  misery unless  miracle  grace prevent it they everlastingly perish  their own deceivings  now i saw  my dream   this time  pilgrims  got over  enchanted ground  entering into  country  beulah whose air  very sweet  pleasant  way lying directly through it they solaced themselves there   season yea here they heard continually  singing  birds  saw every day  flowers appear   earth  heard  voice   turtle   land isa  song  solomon  in this country  sun shineth night  day wherefore this  beyond  valley   shadow  death  also out   reach  giant despair neither could they  this place so much  see doubting castle here they  within sight   city they  going to also here met them some   inhabitants thereof   this land  shining ones commonly walked because   upon  borders  heaven in this land also  contract between  bride   bridegroom  renewed yea here as  bridegroom rejoiceth over  bride so did their god rejoice over them isa  here they had no want  corn  wine   this place they met  abundance  what they had sought   all their pilgrimage isa  here they heard voices  out   city loud voices saying say ye   daughter  zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward   him here all  inhabitants   country called them the holy people the redeemed   lord sought out etc isa   now  they walked  this land they had more rejoicing than  parts more remote   kingdom  which they  bound  drawing near   city they had yet  more perfect view thereof it  builded  pearls  precious stones also  street thereof  paved  gold so   reason   natural glory   city   reflection   sunbeams upon it christian  desire fell sick hopeful also had  fit or two   same disease wherefore here they lay    while crying out because  their pangs if ye find my beloved tell him  i am sick  love  but being  little strengthened  better able  bear their sickness they walked  their way  came yet nearer  nearer where  orchards vineyards  gardens  their gates opened into  highway now  they came up  these places behold  gardener stood   way  whom  pilgrims said whose goodly vineyards  gardens  these he answered they   kings   planted here  his own delight  also   solace  pilgrims so  gardener had them into  vineyards  bid them refresh themselves   dainties deut  he also showed them there  kings walks   arbours where  delighted  be  here they tarried  slept  now i beheld  my dream  they talked more  their sleep  this time than ever they did  all their journey  being   muse thereabout  gardener said even  me wherefore musest thou   matter it   nature   fruit   grapes  these vineyards  go down so sweetly   cause  lips  them   asleep  speak  so i saw  when they awoke they addressed themselves  go up   city but  i said  reflection   sun upon  city for  city  pure gold  so extremely glorious  they could not  yet  open face behold it but through  instrument made   purpose so i saw   i went on there met them two men  raiment  shone like gold also their faces shone   light rev   cor   these men asked  pilgrims whence they came  they told them they also asked them where they had lodged what difficulties  dangers what comforts  pleasures they had met   way  they told them then said  men  met them you have but two difficulties more  meet with  then you    city  christian then  his companion asked  men  go along  them so they told them they would but said they you must obtain   your own faith so i saw  my dream  they went  together until they came  sight   gate  now i further saw  betwixt them   gate   river but there  no bridge  go over  river  very deep at  sight therefore  this river  pilgrims  much stunned but  men  went   them said you must go through or you cannot come   gate  the pilgrims then began  inquire if there  no other way   gate  which they answered yes but there hath not any save two  wit enoch  elijah been permitted  tread  path since  foundation   world nor shall until  last trumpet shall sound  cor  the pilgrims then especially christian began  despond  their minds  looked this way  that but no way could  found  them  which they might escape  river then they asked  men if  waters  all   depth they said no yet they could not help them   case for said they you shall find  deeper or shallower  you believe   king   place in  resurrection   righteous rev   they then addressed themselves   water and entering christian began  sink  crying out  his good friend hopeful  said i sink  deep waters  billows go over my head all his waves go over me selah  christians conflict   hour  death then said  other be  good cheer my brother i feel  bottom    good then said christian ah my friend  sorrows  death hath compassed me about i shall not see  land  flows  milk  honey     great darkness  horror fell upon christian so   could not see before him also here   great measure lost his senses so   could neither remember nor orderly talk  any  those sweet refreshments   had met    way  his pilgrimage but all  words   spake still tended  discover   had horror  mind  heart fears   should die   river  never obtain entrance    gate here also  they  stood  perceived   much   troublesome thoughts   sins   had committed both since  before  began    pilgrim it  also observed    troubled  apparitions  hobgoblins  evil spirits  ever  anon  would intimate so much  words hopeful therefore here had much ado  keep his brothers head above water yea sometimes  would  quite gone down  then ere  while  would rise up again half dead hopeful also would endeavour  comfort him saying brother i see  gate  men standing   receive us but christian would answer it  you   you they wait for you have been hopeful ever since i knew you and so have you said   christian ah brother said he surely if i  right  would now arise  help me but  my sins  hath brought me into  snare  hath left me then said hopeful my brother you have quite forgot  text where   said   wicked there  no bands  their death but their strength  firm they  not  trouble  other men neither  they plagued like other men ps  these troubles  distresses  you go through  these waters  no sign  god hath forsaken you but  sent  try you whether you  call  mind  which heretofore you have received  his goodness  live upon him  your distresses  then i saw  my dream  christian     muse  while to whom also hopeful added this word be  good cheer jesus christ maketh thee whole    christian brake out   loud voice oh i see him again   tells me when thou passest through  waters i    thee  through  rivers they shall not overflow thee isa  then they both took courage   enemy  after   still   stone until they  gone over christian therefore presently found ground  stand upon  so  followed   rest   river  but shallow thus they got over now upon  bank   river   other side they saw  two shining men again who there waited  them wherefore being come out   river they saluted them saying we  ministering spirits sent forth  minister  those  shall  heirs  salvation thus they went along towards  gate  now you must note   city stood upon  mighty hill but  pilgrims went up  hill  ease because they had these two men  lead them up   arms also they had left their mortal garments behind them   river  though they went   them they came out without them they therefore went up here  much agility  speed though  foundation upon which  city  framed  higher than  clouds they therefore went up through  regions   air sweetly talking  they went being comforted because they safely got over  river  had such glorious companions  attend them now now look how  holy pilgrims ride clouds  their chariots angels  their guide who would not here  him all hazards run that thus provides  his when this worlds done  the talk they had   shining ones  about  glory   place who told them   beauty  glory    inexpressible there said they   mount zion  heavenly jerusalem  innumerable company  angels   spirits  just men made perfect heb  you  going now said they   paradise  god wherein you shall see  tree  life  eat   neverfading fruits thereof  when you come there you shall have white robes given you  your walk  talk shall  every day   king even all  days  eternity rev    there you shall not see again such things  you saw when you    lower region upon  earth  wit sorrow sickness affliction  death   former things  passed away you  now going  abraham  isaac  jacob    prophetsmen  god hath taken away   evil  come    now resting upon their beds each one walking  his righteousness isa   the men then asked what must we do   holy place to whom   answered you must there receive  comforts  all your toil  have joy  all your sorrow you must reap what you have sown even  fruit  all your prayers  tears  sufferings   king   way gal  in  place you must wear crowns  gold  enjoy  perpetual sight  vision   holy one  there you shall see him   is  john  there also you shall serve him continually  praise  shouting  thanksgiving whom you desired  serve   world though  much difficulty because   infirmity  your flesh there your eyes shall  delighted  seeing  your ears  hearing  pleasant voice   mighty one there you shall enjoy your friends again   gone thither before you  there you shall  joy receive even every one  follows into  holy place after you there also shall you  clothed  glory  majesty  put into  equipage fit  ride out   king  glory when  shall come  sound  trumpet   clouds  upon  wings   wind you shall come  him  when  shall sit upon  throne  judgment you shall sit  him yea  when  shall pass sentence upon all  workers  iniquity let them  angels or men you also shall have  voice   judgment because they  his  your enemies  thes  jude  dan   cor  also when  shall again return   city you shall go too  sound  trumpet   ever  him  now while they  thus drawing towards  gate behold  company   heavenly host came out  meet them  whom   said   other two shining ones these   men  have loved our lord when they    world   have left all  his holy name   hath sent us  fetch them  we have brought them thus far  their desired journey  they may go   look their redeemer   face  joy then  heavenly host gave  great shout saying blessed  they which  called unto  marriage supper   lamb rev  there came out also  this time  meet them several   kings trumpeters clothed  white  shining raiment who  melodious noises  loud made even  heavens  echo  their sound these trumpeters saluted christian  his fellow  ten thousand welcomes   world  this they did  shouting  sound  trumpet  this done they compassed them round  every side some went before some behind  some   right hand some   left as    guard them through  upper regions continually sounding  they went  melodious noise  notes  high so   very sight was  them  could behold it  if heaven itself  come down  meet them thus therefore they walked  together   they walked ever  anon these trumpeters even  joyful sound would  mixing their music  looks  gestures still signify  christian  his brother how welcome they  into their company   what gladness they came  meet them  now  these two men   were  heaven before they came  it being swallowed up   sight  angels   hearing  their melodious notes here also they had  city itself  view  they thought they heard all  bells therein  ring  welcome them thereto but above all  warm  joyful thoughts  they had about their own dwelling there  such company    ever  ever oh  what tongue or pen can their glorious joy  expressed and thus they came up   gate  now when they  come up   gate there  written over   letters  gold blessed  they  do his commandments  they may have right   tree  life  may enter  through  gates into  city rev   then i saw  my dream   shining men bid them call   gate  which when they did some looked  above over  gate  wit enoch moses  elijah c  whom   said these pilgrims  come   city  destruction   love  they bear   king  this place  then  pilgrims gave  unto them each man his certificate which they had received   beginning those therefore  carried    king who when  had read them said where   men to whom   answered they  standing without  gate the king then commanded  open  gate that  righteous nation said he which keepeth  truth may enter in isa   now i saw  my dream  these two men went    gate  lo  they entered they  transfigured  they had raiment put   shone like gold there  also  met them  harps  crowns  gave them  themthe harps  praise withal   crowns  token  honour then i heard  my dream  all  bells   city rang again  joy     said unto them enter ye into the joy of your lord i also heard  men themselves  they sang   loud voice saying blessing and honour and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever rev   now just   gates  opened  let   men i looked  after them and behold  city shone like  sun  streets also  paved  gold   them walked many men  crowns  their heads palms  their hands  golden harps  sing praises withal  there  also  them  had wings  they answered one another without intermission saying holy holy holy   lord rev  and after  they shut up  gates which when i had seen i wished myself among them  now while i  gazing upon all these things i turned my head  look back  saw ignorance come up   river side but  soon got over   without half  difficulty which  other two men met with for  happened  there  then   place one vainhope  ferryman   his boat helped him over so he   other i saw did ascend  hill  come up   gate only  came alone neither did any man meet him   least encouragement when   come up   gate  looked up   writing   above  then began  knock supposing  entrance should have been quickly administered  him but   asked   men  looked over  top   gate whence came you  what would you have he answered i have eat  drank   presence   king    taught  our streets then they asked him  his certificate  they might go   show    king so  fumbled  his bosom  one  found none then said they have you none but  man answered never  word so they told  king but  would not come down  see him but commanded  two shining ones  conducted christian  hopeful   city  go out  take ignorance  bind him hand  foot  have him away then they took him up  carried him through  air   door  i saw   side   hill  put him  there then i saw  there   way  hell even   gates  heaven  well    city  destruction so i awoke  behold    dream  the conclusion now reader i have told my dream  thee see if thou canst interpret   me or  thyself or neighbour but take heed of misinterpreting  that instead of doing good  but thyself abuse by misinterpreting evil ensues take heed also  thou  not extreme in playing   outside  my dream nor let my figure or similitude put thee into  laughter or  feud leave this  boys  fools but   thee do thou  substance  my matter see put   curtains look within my veil turn up my metaphors  do not fail there if thou seekest them such things  find as   helpful   honest mind what  my dross thou findest there  bold to throw away but yet preserve  gold what if my gold  wrapped up  ore none throws away  apple   core but if thou shalt cast all away  vain i know not but twill make me dream again  end of the project gutenberg ebook the pilgrim’s progress  updated editions  replace
