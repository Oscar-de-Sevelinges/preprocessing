chapter i down  rabbithole alice  beginning  get very tired  sitting  her sister   bank   having nothing  do once or twice she had peeped into  book her sister  reading but  had no pictures or conversations  it “and what   use   book” thought alice “without pictures or conversations” so she  considering  her own mind as well  she could   hot day made her feel very sleepy  stupid whether  pleasure  making  daisychain would  worth  trouble  getting up  picking  daisies when suddenly  white rabbit  pink eyes ran close  her there  nothing so very remarkable  that nor did alice think  so very much out   way  hear  rabbit say  itself “oh dear oh dear i shall  late” when she thought  over afterwards  occurred  her  she ought  have wondered  this but   time  all seemed quite natural but when  rabbit actually took  watch out   waistcoatpocket  looked  it  then hurried on alice started  her feet   flashed across her mind  she had never before seen  rabbit  either  waistcoatpocket or  watch  take out  it  burning  curiosity she ran across  field after it  fortunately  just  time  see  pop down  large rabbithole under  hedge in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how   world she   get out again the rabbithole went straight  like  tunnel  some way  then dipped suddenly down so suddenly  alice had not  moment  think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down  very deep well either  well  very deep or she fell very slowly  she had plenty  time  she went down  look about her   wonder what  going  happen next first she tried  look down  make out what she  coming to but   too dark  see anything then she looked   sides   well  noticed  they  filled  cupboards  bookshelves here  there she saw maps  pictures hung upon pegs she took down  jar  one   shelves  she passed   labelled “orange marmalade” but  her great disappointment   empty she did not like  drop  jar  fear  killing somebody underneath so managed  put  into one   cupboards  she fell past it “well” thought alice  herself “after such  fall  this i shall think nothing  tumbling down stairs how brave they’ll all think me  home why i wouldn’t say anything about it even if i fell off  top   house” which  very likely true down down down would  fall never come   end “i wonder how many miles i’ve fallen  this time” she said aloud “i must  getting somewhere near  centre   earth let me see  would  four thousand miles down i think—” for you see alice had learnt several things  this sort  her lessons   schoolroom  though this  not  very good opportunity  showing off her knowledge  there  no one  listen  her still   good practice  say  over “—yes that’s about  right distance—but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i’ve got to” alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they  nice grand words  say presently she began again “i wonder if i shall fall right through  earth how funny it’ll seem  come out among  people  walk  their heads downward the antipathies i think—” she  rather glad there was no one listening this time   didn’t sound  all  right word “—but i shall have  ask them what  name   country is you know please ma’am  this new zealand or australia” and she tried  curtsey  she spoke—fancy curtseying  you’re falling through  air do you think you could manage it “and what  ignorant little girl she’ll think me  asking no it’ll never do  ask perhaps i shall see  written up somewhere” down down down there  nothing else  do so alice soon began talking again “dinah’ll miss me very much tonight i should think” dinah   cat “i hope they’ll remember her saucer  milk  teatime dinah my dear i wish you  down here  me there  no mice   air i’m afraid but you might catch  bat  that’s very like  mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder” and here alice began  get rather sleepy  went  saying  herself   dreamy sort  way “do cats eat bats do cats eat bats”  sometimes “do bats eat cats” for you see  she couldn’t answer either question  didn’t much matter which way she put it she felt  she  dozing off  had just begun  dream  she  walking hand  hand  dinah  saying  her very earnestly “now dinah tell me  truth did you ever eat  bat” when suddenly thump thump down she came upon  heap  sticks  dry leaves   fall  over alice  not  bit hurt  she jumped up   her feet   moment she looked up but   all dark overhead before her  another long passage   white rabbit  still  sight hurrying down it there  not  moment   lost away went alice like  wind   just  time  hear  say   turned  corner “oh my ears  whiskers how late it’s getting” she  close behind  when she turned  corner but  rabbit  no longer   seen she found herself   long low hall which  lit up   row  lamps hanging   roof there  doors all round  hall but they  all locked  when alice had been all  way down one side  up  other trying every door she walked sadly down  middle wondering how she  ever  get out again suddenly she came upon  little threelegged table all made  solid glass there  nothing   except  tiny golden key  alice’s first thought    might belong  one   doors   hall but alas either  locks  too large or  key  too small but  any rate  would not open any  them however   second time round she came upon  low curtain she had not noticed before  behind    little door about fifteen inches high she tried  little golden key   lock   her great delight  fitted alice opened  door  found   led into  small passage not much larger than  rathole she knelt down  looked along  passage into  loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed  get out   dark hall  wander about among those beds  bright flowers  those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through  doorway “and even if my head would go through” thought poor alice “it would   very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like  telescope i think i could if i only knew how  begin” for you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately  alice had begun  think  very few things indeed  really impossible there seemed   no use  waiting   little door so she went back   table half hoping she might find another key  it or  any rate  book  rules  shutting people up like telescopes this time she found  little bottle  it “which certainly  not here before” said alice  round  neck   bottle   paper label   words “drink me” beautifully printed    large letters it  all very well  say “drink me” but  wise little alice  not going  do that   hurry “no i’ll look first” she said “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”  she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt  eaten up  wild beasts  other unpleasant things all because they would not remember  simple rules their friends had taught them such as   redhot poker  burn you if you hold  too long   if you cut your finger very deeply   knife  usually bleeds  she had never forgotten that if you drink much   bottle marked “poison”   almost certain  disagree  you sooner or later however this bottle  not marked “poison” so alice ventured  taste it  finding  very nice it had  fact  sort  mixed flavour  cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee  hot buttered toast she very soon finished  off                     “what  curious feeling” said alice “i must  shutting up like  telescope” and so   indeed she  now only ten inches high  her face brightened up   thought  she  now  right size  going through  little door into  lovely garden first however she waited   few minutes  see if she  going  shrink any further she felt  little nervous about this “for  might end you know” said alice  herself “in my going out altogether like  candle i wonder what i should  like then” and she tried  fancy what  flame   candle  like after  candle  blown out  she could not remember ever having seen such  thing after  while finding  nothing more happened she decided  going into  garden  once but alas  poor alice when she got   door she found she had forgotten  little golden key  when she went back   table  it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see  quite plainly through  glass  she tried her best  climb up one   legs   table but   too slippery  when she had tired herself out  trying  poor little thing sat down  cried “come there’s no use  crying like that” said alice  herself rather sharply “i advise you  leave off this minute” she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it  sometimes she scolded herself so severely   bring tears into her eyes  once she remembered trying  box her own ears  having cheated herself   game  croquet she  playing against herself  this curious child  very fond  pretending   two people “but it’s no use now” thought poor alice “to pretend   two people why there’s hardly enough  me left  make one respectable person” soon her eye fell   little glass box   lying under  table she opened it  found    very small cake  which  words “eat me”  beautifully marked  currants “well i’ll eat it” said alice “and if  makes me grow larger i can reach  key  if  makes me grow smaller i can creep under  door so either way i’ll get into  garden  i don’t care which happens” she ate  little bit  said anxiously  herself “which way which way” holding her hand   top  her head  feel which way   growing  she  quite surprised  find  she remained  same size   sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into  way  expecting nothing but outoftheway things  happen   seemed quite dull  stupid  life  go    common way so she set  work  very soon finished off  cake                     chapter ii the pool  tears “curiouser  curiouser” cried alice she  so much surprised    moment she quite forgot how  speak good english “now i’m opening out like  largest telescope  ever was goodbye feet” for when she looked down  her feet they seemed   almost out  sight they  getting so far off “oh my poor little feet i wonder who  put  your shoes  stockings  you now dears i’m sure i shan’t  able i shall   great deal too far off  trouble myself about you you must manage  best way you can—but i must  kind  them” thought alice “or perhaps they won’t walk  way i want  go let me see i’ll give them  new pair  boots every christmas” and she went  planning  herself how she would manage it “they must go   carrier” she thought “and how funny it’ll seem sending presents  one’s own feet and how odd  directions  look alice’s right foot esq hearthrug near  fender with alice’s love oh dear what nonsense i’m talking” just then her head struck against  roof   hall  fact she  now more than nine feet high  she  once took up  little golden key  hurried off   garden door poor alice it   much  she could do lying down  one side  look through into  garden  one eye but  get through  more hopeless than ever she sat down  began  cry again “you ought   ashamed  yourself” said alice “a great girl like you” she might well say this “to go  crying  this way stop this moment i tell you” but she went  all  same shedding gallons  tears until there   large pool all round her about four inches deep  reaching half down  hall after  time she heard  little pattering  feet   distance  she hastily dried her eyes  see what  coming it   white rabbit returning splendidly dressed   pair  white kid gloves  one hand   large fan   other  came trotting along   great hurry muttering  himself   came “oh  duchess  duchess oh won’t she  savage if i’ve kept her waiting” alice felt so desperate  she  ready  ask help  any one so when  rabbit came near her she began   low timid voice “if you please sir—” the rabbit started violently dropped  white kid gloves   fan  skurried away into  darkness  hard   could go alice took up  fan  gloves and   hall  very hot she kept fanning herself all  time she went  talking “dear dear how queer everything  today and yesterday things went  just  usual i wonder if i’ve been changed   night let me think  i  same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling  little different but if i’m not  same  next question is who   world am i ah that’s  great puzzle” and she began thinking over all  children she knew     same age  herself  see if she could have been changed  any  them “i’m sure i’m not ada” she said “for her hair goes  such long ringlets  mine doesn’t go  ringlets  all  i’m sure i can’t  mabel  i know all sorts  things  she oh she knows such  very little besides she’s she  i’m i and—oh dear how puzzling  all is i’ll try if i know all  things i used  know let me see four times five  twelve  four times six  thirteen  four times seven is—oh dear i shall never get  twenty   rate however  multiplication table doesn’t signify let’s try geography london   capital  paris  paris   capital  rome  rome—no that’s all wrong i’m certain i must have been changed  mabel i’ll try  say ‘how doth  little—’”  she crossed her hands  her lap  if she  saying lessons  began  repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse  strange   words did not come  same  they used  do— “how doth  little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour  waters   nile on every golden scale “how cheerfully  seems  grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes  with gently smiling jaws” “i’m sure those  not  right words” said poor alice  her eyes filled  tears again  she went on “i must  mabel after all  i shall have  go  live   poky little house  have next  no toys  play with  oh ever so many lessons  learn no i’ve made up my mind about it if i’m mabel i’ll stay down here it’ll  no use their putting their heads down  saying ‘come up again dear’ i shall only look up  say ‘who am i then tell me  first  then if i like being  person i’ll come up if not i’ll stay down here till i’m somebody else’—but oh dear” cried alice   sudden burst  tears “i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired  being all alone here” as she said this she looked down  her hands   surprised  see  she had put  one   rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she  talking “how can i have done that” she thought “i must  growing small again” she got up  went   table  measure herself  it  found that  nearly  she could guess she  now about two feet high   going  shrinking rapidly she soon found out   cause  this   fan she  holding  she dropped  hastily just  time  avoid shrinking away altogether “that was  narrow escape” said alice  good deal frightened   sudden change but very glad  find herself still  existence “and now   garden”  she ran  all speed back   little door but alas  little door  shut again   little golden key  lying   glass table  before “and things  worse than ever” thought  poor child “for i never  so small  this before never and i declare it’s too bad   is” as she said these words her foot slipped   another moment splash she  up  her chin  salt water her first idea   she had somehow fallen into  sea “and   case i can go back  railway” she said  herself alice had been   seaside once  her life  had come   general conclusion  wherever you go    english coast you find  number  bathing machines   sea some children digging   sand  wooden spades then  row  lodging houses  behind them  railway station however she soon made out  she    pool  tears which she had wept when she  nine feet high “i wish i hadn’t cried so much” said alice  she swam about trying  find her way out “i shall  punished   now i suppose  being drowned  my own tears that will   queer thing   sure however everything  queer today” just then she heard something splashing about   pool  little way off  she swam nearer  make out what  was  first she thought  must   walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she  now  she soon made out    only  mouse  had slipped  like herself “would    any use now” thought alice “to speak  this mouse everything  so outoftheway down here  i should think very likely  can talk  any rate there’s no harm  trying” so she began “o mouse do you know  way out  this pool i am very tired  swimming about here o mouse” alice thought this must   right way  speaking   mouse she had never done such  thing before but she remembered having seen  her brother’s latin grammar “a mouse—of  mouse—to  mouse—a mouse—o mouse” the mouse looked  her rather inquisitively  seemed  her  wink  one   little eyes but  said nothing “perhaps  doesn’t understand english” thought alice “i daresay it’s  french mouse come over  william  conqueror” for  all her knowledge  history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she began again “où est ma chatte” which   first sentence  her french lessonbook the mouse gave  sudden leap out   water  seemed  quiver all over  fright “oh i beg your pardon” cried alice hastily afraid  she had hurt  poor animal’s feelings “i quite forgot you didn’t like cats” “not like cats” cried  mouse   shrill passionate voice “would you like cats if you  me” “well perhaps not” said alice   soothing tone “don’t  angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you’d take  fancy  cats if you could only see her she  such  dear quiet thing” alice went on half  herself  she swam lazily about   pool “and she sits purring so nicely   fire licking her paws  washing her face—and she  such  nice soft thing  nurse—and she’s such  capital one  catching mice—oh i beg your pardon” cried alice again  this time  mouse  bristling all over  she felt certain  must  really offended “we won’t talk about her any more if you’d rather not” “we indeed” cried  mouse who  trembling down   end  his tail “as if i would talk  such  subject our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things don’t let me hear  name again” “i won’t indeed” said alice   great hurry  change  subject  conversation “are you—are you fond—of—of dogs” the mouse did not answer so alice went  eagerly “there  such  nice little dog near our house i should like  show you a little brighteyed terrier you know  oh such long curly brown hair and it’ll fetch things when you throw them  it’ll sit up  beg   dinner  all sorts  things—i can’t remember half  them—and  belongs   farmer you know   says it’s so useful it’s worth  hundred pounds he says  kills all  rats and—oh dear” cried alice   sorrowful tone “i’m afraid i’ve offended  again” for  mouse  swimming away  her  hard   could go  making quite  commotion   pool   went so she called softly after it “mouse dear do come back again  we won’t talk about cats or dogs either if you don’t like them” when  mouse heard this  turned round  swam slowly back  her  face  quite pale with passion alice thought   said   low trembling voice “let us get   shore  then i’ll tell you my history  you’ll understand why   i hate cats  dogs” it  high time  go   pool  getting quite crowded   birds  animals  had fallen into it there   duck   dodo  lory   eaglet  several other curious creatures alice led  way   whole party swam   shore chapter iii a caucusrace   long tale they  indeed  queerlooking party  assembled   bank—the birds  draggled feathers  animals  their fur clinging close  them  all dripping wet cross  uncomfortable the first question  course was how  get dry again they had  consultation about this  after  few minutes  seemed quite natural  alice  find herself talking familiarly  them  if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite  long argument   lory who  last turned sulky  would only say “i am older than you  must know better”  this alice would not allow without knowing how old  was and   lory positively refused  tell  age there  no more   said at last  mouse who seemed    person  authority among them called out “sit down all  you  listen  me i’ll soon make you dry enough” they all sat down  once   large ring   mouse   middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed  it  she felt sure she would catch  bad cold if she did not get dry very soon “ahem” said  mouse   important air “are you all ready this   driest thing i know silence all round if you please ‘william  conqueror whose cause  favoured   pope  soon submitted    english who wanted leaders  had been  late much accustomed  usurpation  conquest edwin  morcar  earls  mercia  northumbria—’” “ugh” said  lory   shiver “i beg your pardon” said  mouse frowning but very politely “did you speak” “not i” said  lory hastily “i thought you did” said  mouse “—i proceed ‘edwin  morcar  earls  mercia  northumbria declared  him  even stigand  patriotic archbishop  canterbury found  advisable—’” “found what” said  duck “found it”  mouse replied rather crossly “of course you know what ‘it’ means” “i know what ‘it’ means well enough when i find  thing” said  duck “it’s generally  frog or  worm the question is what did  archbishop find” the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on “‘—found  advisable  go  edgar atheling  meet william  offer him  crown william’s conduct  first  moderate but  insolence  his normans—’ how  you getting  now my dear”  continued turning  alice   spoke “as wet  ever” said alice   melancholy tone “it doesn’t seem  dry me  all” “in  case” said  dodo solemnly rising   feet “i move   meeting adjourn   immediate adoption  more energetic remedies—” “speak english” said  eaglet “i don’t know  meaning  half those long words and what’s more i don’t believe you do either” and  eaglet bent down  head  hide  smile some   other birds tittered audibly “what i  going  say” said  dodo   offended tone “was   best thing  get us dry would   caucusrace” “what is  caucusrace” said alice not  she wanted much  know but  dodo had paused  if  thought  somebody ought  speak  no one else seemed inclined  say anything “why” said  dodo “the best way  explain    do it” and  you might like  try  thing yourself some winter day i  tell you how  dodo managed it first  marked out  racecourse   sort  circle “the exact shape doesn’t matter”  said  then all  party  placed along  course here  there there  no “one two three  away” but they began running when they liked  left off when they liked so    not easy  know when  race  over however when they had been running half  hour or so   quite dry again  dodo suddenly called out “the race  over”  they all crowded round it panting  asking “but who  won” this question  dodo could not answer without  great deal  thought   sat   long time  one finger pressed upon  forehead the position  which you usually see shakespeare   pictures  him while  rest waited  silence at last  dodo said “everybody  won  all must have prizes” “but who   give  prizes” quite  chorus  voices asked “why she  course” said  dodo pointing  alice  one finger   whole party  once crowded round her calling out   confused way “prizes prizes” alice had no idea what  do   despair she put her hand  her pocket  pulled out  box  comfits luckily  salt water had not got into it  handed them round  prizes there  exactly one apiece all round “but she must have  prize herself you know” said  mouse “of course”  dodo replied very gravely “what else have you got  your pocket”  went on turning  alice “only  thimble” said alice sadly “hand  over here” said  dodo then they all crowded round her once more while  dodo solemnly presented  thimble saying “we beg your acceptance  this elegant thimble” and when  had finished this short speech they all cheered alice thought  whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave  she did not dare  laugh and  she could not think  anything  say she simply bowed  took  thimble looking  solemn  she could the next thing   eat  comfits this caused some noise  confusion   large birds complained  they could not taste theirs   small ones choked  had   patted   back however   over  last  they sat down again   ring  begged  mouse  tell them something more “you promised  tell me your history you know” said alice “and why   you hate—c  d” she added   whisper half afraid   would  offended again “mine   long   sad tale” said  mouse turning  alice  sighing “it is  long tail certainly” said alice looking down  wonder   mouse’s tail “but why do you call  sad” and she kept  puzzling about  while  mouse  speaking so  her idea   tale  something like this— “fury said   mouse that  met   house ‘let us both go  law i  prosecute you—come i’ll take no denial we must have  trial for really this morning i’ve nothing  do’ said  mouse   cur ‘such  trial dear sir with no jury or judge would  wasting our breath’ ‘i’ll  judge i’ll  jury’ said cunning old fury ‘i’ll try  whole cause  condemn you  death’” “you  not attending” said  mouse  alice severely “what  you thinking of” “i beg your pardon” said alice very humbly “you had got   fifth bend i think” “i had not” cried  mouse sharply  very angrily “a knot” said alice always ready  make herself useful  looking anxiously about her “oh do let me help  undo it” “i shall do nothing   sort” said  mouse getting up  walking away “you insult me  talking such nonsense” “i didn’t mean it” pleaded poor alice “but you’re so easily offended you know” the mouse only growled  reply “please come back  finish your story” alice called after it   others all joined  chorus “yes please do” but  mouse only shook  head impatiently  walked  little quicker “what  pity  wouldn’t stay” sighed  lory  soon    quite out  sight   old crab took  opportunity  saying  her daughter “ah my dear let this   lesson  you never  lose your temper” “hold your tongue ma” said  young crab  little snappishly “you’re enough  try  patience   oyster” “i wish i had our dinah here i know i do” said alice aloud addressing nobody  particular “she’d soon fetch  back” “and who  dinah if i might venture  ask  question” said  lory alice replied eagerly  she  always ready  talk about her pet “dinah’s our cat and she’s such  capital one  catching mice you can’t think and oh i wish you could see her after  birds why she’ll eat  little bird  soon  look  it” this speech caused  remarkable sensation among  party some   birds hurried off  once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking “i really must  getting home  nightair doesn’t suit my throat”   canary called out   trembling voice   children “come away my dears it’s high time you  all  bed” on various pretexts they all moved off  alice  soon left alone “i wish i hadn’t mentioned dinah” she said  herself   melancholy tone “nobody seems  like her down here  i’m sure she’s  best cat   world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you any more” and here poor alice began  cry again  she felt very lonely  lowspirited in  little while however she again heard  little pattering  footsteps   distance  she looked up eagerly half hoping   mouse had changed his mind   coming back  finish his story chapter iv the rabbit sends   little bill it   white rabbit trotting slowly back again  looking anxiously about   went  if  had lost something  she heard  muttering  itself “the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur  whiskers she’ll get me executed  sure  ferrets  ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder” alice guessed   moment    looking   fan   pair  white kid gloves  she very goodnaturedly began hunting about  them but they  nowhere   seen—everything seemed  have changed since her swim   pool   great hall   glass table   little door had vanished completely very soon  rabbit noticed alice  she went hunting about  called out  her   angry tone “why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this moment  fetch me  pair  gloves   fan quick now” and alice  so much frightened  she ran off  once   direction  pointed to without trying  explain  mistake  had made “he took me  his housemaid” she said  herself  she ran “how surprised he’ll  when  finds out who i am but i’d better take him his fan  gloves—that is if i can find them” as she said this she came upon  neat little house   door  which   bright brass plate   name “w rabbit” engraved upon it she went  without knocking  hurried upstairs  great fear lest she should meet  real mary ann   turned out   house before she had found  fan  gloves “how queer  seems” alice said  herself “to  going messages   rabbit i suppose dinah’ll  sending me  messages next” and she began fancying  sort  thing  would happen “‘miss alice come here directly  get ready  your walk’ ‘coming   minute nurse but i’ve got  see   mouse doesn’t get out’ only i don’t think” alice went on “that they’d let dinah stop   house if  began ordering people about like that” by this time she had found her way into  tidy little room   table   window    as she had hoped  fan  two or three pairs  tiny white kid gloves she took up  fan   pair   gloves   just going  leave  room when her eye fell upon  little bottle  stood near  lookingglass there  no label this time   words “drink me” but nevertheless she uncorked   put   her lips “i know something interesting  sure  happen” she said  herself “whenever i eat or drink anything so i’ll just see what this bottle does i do hope it’ll make me grow large again  really i’m quite tired  being such  tiny little thing” it did so indeed  much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half  bottle she found her head pressing against  ceiling  had  stoop  save her neck  being broken she hastily put down  bottle saying  herself “that’s quite enough—i hope i shan’t grow any more—as  is i can’t get out   door—i do wish i hadn’t drunk quite so much” alas   too late  wish that she went  growing  growing  very soon had  kneel down   floor  another minute there  not even room  this  she tried  effect  lying down  one elbow against  door   other arm curled round her head still she went  growing and   last resource she put one arm out   window  one foot up  chimney  said  herself “now i can do no more whatever happens what will become  me” luckily  alice  little magic bottle had now had  full effect  she grew no larger still   very uncomfortable and  there seemed   no sort  chance  her ever getting out   room again no wonder she felt unhappy “it  much pleasanter  home” thought poor alice “when one wasn’t always growing larger  smaller  being ordered about  mice  rabbits i almost wish i hadn’t gone down  rabbithole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious you know this sort  life i do wonder what can have happened  me when i used  read fairytales i fancied  kind  thing never happened  now here i am   middle  one there ought    book written about me  there ought and when i grow up i’ll write one—but i’m grown up now” she added   sorrowful tone “at least there’s no room  grow up any more here” “but then” thought alice “shall i never get any older than i am now that’ll   comfort one way—never    old woman—but then—always  have lessons  learn oh i shouldn’t like that” “oh you foolish alice” she answered herself “how can you learn lessons  here why there’s hardly room  you  no room  all  any lessonbooks” and so she went on taking first one side  then  other  making quite  conversation   altogether but after  few minutes she heard  voice outside  stopped  listen “mary ann mary ann” said  voice “fetch me my gloves this moment” then came  little pattering  feet   stairs alice knew    rabbit coming  look  her  she trembled till she shook  house quite forgetting  she  now about  thousand times  large   rabbit  had no reason   afraid  it presently  rabbit came up   door  tried  open it but   door opened inwards  alice’s elbow  pressed hard against it  attempt proved  failure alice heard  say  itself “then i’ll go round  get    window” “that you won’t” thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard  rabbit just under  window she suddenly spread out her hand  made  snatch   air she did not get hold  anything but she heard  little shriek   fall   crash  broken glass  which she concluded    just possible  had fallen into  cucumberframe or something   sort next came  angry voice—the rabbit’s—“pat pat where  you” and then  voice she had never heard before “sure then i’m here digging  apples yer honour” “digging  apples indeed” said  rabbit angrily “here come  help me out  this” sounds  more broken glass “now tell me pat what’s    window” “sure it’s  arm yer honour” he pronounced  “arrum” “an arm you goose who ever saw one  size why  fills  whole window” “sure  does yer honour but it’s  arm  all that” “well it’s got no business there  any rate go  take  away” there   long silence after this  alice could only hear whispers now  then such as “sure i don’t like it yer honour  all  all” “do  i tell you you coward”   last she spread out her hand again  made another snatch   air this time there  two little shrieks  more sounds  broken glass “what  number  cucumberframes there must be” thought alice “i wonder what they’ll do next as  pulling me out   window i only wish they could i’m sure i don’t want  stay  here any longer” she waited  some time without hearing anything more  last came  rumbling  little cartwheels   sound   good many voices all talking together she made out  words “where’s  other ladder—why i hadn’t  bring but one bill’s got  other—bill fetch  here lad—here put ’em up  this corner—no tie ’em together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—oh they’ll do well enough don’t  particular—here bill catch hold  this rope—will  roof bear—mind  loose slate—oh it’s coming down heads below” a loud crash—“now who did that—it  bill i fancy—who’s  go down  chimney—nay i shan’t you do it—that i won’t then—bill’s  go down—here bill  master says you’re  go down  chimney” “oh so bill’s got  come down  chimney  he” said alice  herself “shy they seem  put everything upon bill i wouldn’t   bill’s place   good deal this fireplace  narrow   sure but i think i can kick  little” she drew her foot  far down  chimney  she could  waited till she heard  little animal she couldn’t guess  what sort  was scratching  scrambling about   chimney close above her then saying  herself “this  bill” she gave one sharp kick  waited  see what would happen next the first thing she heard   general chorus  “there goes bill” then  rabbit’s voice along—“catch him you   hedge” then silence  then another confusion  voices—“hold up his head—brandy now—don’t choke him—how  it old fellow what happened  you tell us all about it” last came  little feeble squeaking voice “that’s bill” thought alice “well i hardly know—no more thank ye i’m better now—but i’m  deal too flustered  tell you—all i know is something comes  me like  jackinthebox  up i goes like  skyrocket” “so you did old fellow” said  others “we must burn  house down” said  rabbit’s voice  alice called out  loud  she could “if you do i’ll set dinah  you” there   dead silence instantly  alice thought  herself “i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense they’d take  roof off” after  minute or two they began moving about again  alice heard  rabbit say “a barrowful  do  begin with” “a barrowful  what” thought alice but she had not long  doubt   next moment  shower  little pebbles came rattling    window  some  them hit her   face “i’ll put  stop  this” she said  herself  shouted out “you’d better not do  again” which produced another dead silence alice noticed  some surprise   pebbles  all turning into little cakes  they lay   floor   bright idea came into her head “if i eat one  these cakes” she thought “it’s sure  make some change  my size    can’t possibly make me larger  must make me smaller i suppose” so she swallowed one   cakes   delighted  find  she began shrinking directly as soon  she  small enough  get through  door she ran out   house  found quite  crowd  little animals  birds waiting outside the poor little lizard bill    middle being held up  two guineapigs who  giving  something out   bottle they all made  rush  alice  moment she appeared but she ran off  hard  she could  soon found herself safe   thick wood “the first thing i’ve got  do” said alice  herself  she wandered about   wood “is  grow  my right size again   second thing   find my way into  lovely garden i think     best plan” it sounded  excellent plan no doubt  very neatly  simply arranged  only difficulty was  she had not  smallest idea how  set about it  while she  peering about anxiously among  trees  little sharp bark just over her head made her look up   great hurry an enormous puppy  looking down  her  large round eyes  feebly stretching out one paw trying  touch her “poor little thing” said alice   coaxing tone  she tried hard  whistle  it but she  terribly frightened all  time   thought   might  hungry  which case  would  very likely  eat her up  spite  all her coaxing hardly knowing what she did she picked up  little bit  stick  held  out   puppy whereupon  puppy jumped into  air off all  feet  once   yelp  delight  rushed   stick  made believe  worry it then alice dodged behind  great thistle  keep herself  being run over   moment she appeared   other side  puppy made another rush   stick  tumbled head over heels   hurry  get hold  it then alice thinking   very like having  game  play   carthorse  expecting every moment   trampled under  feet ran round  thistle again then  puppy began  series  short charges   stick running  very little way forwards each time   long way back  barking hoarsely all  while till  last  sat down  good way off panting   tongue hanging out   mouth   great eyes half shut this seemed  alice  good opportunity  making her escape so she set off  once  ran till she  quite tired  out  breath  till  puppy’s bark sounded quite faint   distance “and yet what  dear little puppy  was” said alice  she leant against  buttercup  rest herself  fanned herself  one   leaves “i should have liked teaching  tricks very much if—if i’d only been  right size  do it oh dear i’d nearly forgotten  i’ve got  grow up again let me see—how is    managed i suppose i ought  eat or drink something or other but  great question is what” the great question certainly was what alice looked all round her   flowers   blades  grass but she did not see anything  looked like  right thing  eat or drink under  circumstances there   large mushroom growing near her about  same height  herself  when she had looked under it   both sides  it  behind it  occurred  her  she might  well look  see what    top  it she stretched herself up  tiptoe  peeped over  edge   mushroom  her eyes immediately met those   large blue caterpillar   sitting   top   arms folded quietly smoking  long hookah  taking not  smallest notice  her or  anything else chapter v advice   caterpillar the caterpillar  alice looked  each other  some time  silence  last  caterpillar took  hookah out   mouth  addressed her   languid sleepy voice “who  you” said  caterpillar this  not  encouraging opening   conversation alice replied rather shyly “i—i hardly know sir just  present—at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then” “what do you mean  that” said  caterpillar sternly “explain yourself” “i can’t explain myself i’m afraid sir” said alice “because i’m not myself you see” “i don’t see” said  caterpillar “i’m afraid i can’t put  more clearly” alice replied very politely “for i can’t understand  myself  begin with  being so many different sizes   day  very confusing” “it isn’t” said  caterpillar “well perhaps you haven’t found  so yet” said alice “but when you have  turn into  chrysalis—you  some day you know—and then after  into  butterfly i should think you’ll feel   little queer won’t you” “not  bit” said  caterpillar “well perhaps your feelings may  different” said alice “all i know is  would feel very queer  me” “you” said  caterpillar contemptuously “who  you” which brought them back again   beginning   conversation alice felt  little irritated   caterpillar’s making such very short remarks  she drew herself up  said very gravely “i think you ought  tell me who you are first” “why” said  caterpillar here  another puzzling question   alice could not think  any good reason    caterpillar seemed     very unpleasant state  mind she turned away “come back”  caterpillar called after her “i’ve something important  say” this sounded promising certainly alice turned  came back again “keep your temper” said  caterpillar “is  all” said alice swallowing down her anger  well  she could “no” said  caterpillar alice thought she might  well wait  she had nothing else  do  perhaps after all  might tell her something worth hearing for some minutes  puffed away without speaking but  last  unfolded  arms took  hookah out   mouth again  said “so you think you’re changed do you” “i’m afraid i am sir” said alice “i can’t remember things  i used—and i don’t keep  same size  ten minutes together” “can’t remember what things” said  caterpillar “well i’ve tried  say “how doth  little busy bee” but  all came different” alice replied   very melancholy voice “repeat “you  old father william’” said  caterpillar alice folded her hands  began— “you  old father william”  young man said “and your hair  become very white and yet you incessantly stand  your head— do you think  your age   right” “in my youth” father william replied  his son “i feared  might injure  brain but now  i’m perfectly sure i have none why i do  again  again” “you  old” said  youth “as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned  backsomersault    door— pray what   reason  that” “in my youth” said  sage   shook his grey locks “i kept all my limbs very supple by  use  this ointment—one shilling  box— allow me  sell you  couple” “you  old” said  youth “and your jaws  too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished  goose   bones   beak— pray how did you manage  do it” “in my youth” said his father “i took   law and argued each case  my wife and  muscular strength which  gave  my jaw has lasted  rest  my life” “you  old” said  youth “one would hardly suppose that your eye   steady  ever yet you balanced  eel   end  your nose— what made you so awfully clever” “i have answered three questions    enough” said his father “don’t give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day  such stuff be off or i’ll kick you down stairs” “that  not said right” said  caterpillar “not quite right i’m afraid” said alice timidly “some   words have got altered” “it  wrong  beginning  end” said  caterpillar decidedly  there  silence  some minutes the caterpillar   first  speak “what size do you want  be”  asked “oh i’m not particular   size” alice hastily replied “only one doesn’t like changing so often you know” “i don’t know” said  caterpillar alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted  her life before  she felt  she  losing her temper “are you content now” said  caterpillar “well i should like    little larger sir if you wouldn’t mind” said alice “three inches  such  wretched height  be” “it   very good height indeed” said  caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright   spoke it  exactly three inches high “but i’m not used  it” pleaded poor alice   piteous tone and she thought  herself “i wish  creatures wouldn’t  so easily offended” “you’ll get used    time” said  caterpillar   put  hookah into  mouth  began smoking again this time alice waited patiently until  chose  speak again in  minute or two  caterpillar took  hookah out   mouth  yawned once or twice  shook itself then  got down off  mushroom  crawled away   grass merely remarking   went “one side  make you grow taller   other side  make you grow shorter” “one side  what the other side  what” thought alice  herself “of  mushroom” said  caterpillar just  if she had asked  aloud   another moment   out  sight alice remained looking thoughtfully   mushroom   minute trying  make out which   two sides  it     perfectly round she found this  very difficult question however  last she stretched her arms round   far  they would go  broke off  bit   edge  each hand “and now which  which” she said  herself  nibbled  little   righthand bit  try  effect  next moment she felt  violent blow underneath her chin  had struck her foot she   good deal frightened  this very sudden change but she felt  there  no time   lost  she  shrinking rapidly so she set  work  once  eat some   other bit her chin  pressed so closely against her foot  there  hardly room  open her mouth but she did   last  managed  swallow  morsel   lefthand bit                     “come my head’s free  last” said alice   tone  delight which changed into alarm  another moment when she found  her shoulders  nowhere   found all she could see when she looked down   immense length  neck which seemed  rise like  stalk out   sea  green leaves  lay far below her “what can all  green stuff be” said alice “and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how   i can’t see you” she  moving them about  she spoke but no result seemed  follow except  little shaking among  distant green leaves as there seemed   no chance  getting her hands up  her head she tried  get her head down  them   delighted  find  her neck would bend about easily  any direction like  serpent she had just succeeded  curving  down into  graceful zigzag   going  dive  among  leaves which she found   nothing but  tops   trees under which she had been wandering when  sharp hiss made her draw back   hurry  large pigeon had flown into her face   beating her violently   wings “serpent” screamed  pigeon “i’m not  serpent” said alice indignantly “let me alone” “serpent i say again” repeated  pigeon but   more subdued tone  added   kind  sob “i’ve tried every way  nothing seems  suit them” “i haven’t  least idea what you’re talking about” said alice “i’ve tried  roots  trees  i’ve tried banks  i’ve tried hedges”  pigeon went on without attending  her “but those serpents there’s no pleasing them” alice  more  more puzzled but she thought there  no use  saying anything more till  pigeon had finished “as if  wasn’t trouble enough hatching  eggs” said  pigeon “but i must    lookout  serpents night  day why i haven’t had  wink  sleep these three weeks” “i’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed” said alice who  beginning  see  meaning “and just  i’d taken  highest tree   wood” continued  pigeon raising  voice   shriek “and just  i  thinking i should  free  them  last they must needs come wriggling down   sky ugh serpent” “but i’m not  serpent i tell you” said alice “i’m a—i’m a—” “well what  you” said  pigeon “i can see you’re trying  invent something” “i—i’m  little girl” said alice rather doubtfully  she remembered  number  changes she had gone through  day “a likely story indeed” said  pigeon   tone   deepest contempt “i’ve seen  good many little girls  my time but never one  such  neck  that no no you’re  serpent  there’s no use denying it i suppose you’ll  telling me next  you never tasted  egg” “i have tasted eggs certainly” said alice who   very truthful child “but little girls eat eggs quite  much  serpents do you know” “i don’t believe it” said  pigeon “but if they do why then they’re  kind  serpent that’s all i can say” this  such  new idea  alice  she  quite silent   minute or two which gave  pigeon  opportunity  adding “you’re looking  eggs i know that well enough  what does  matter  me whether you’re  little girl or  serpent” “it matters  good deal  me” said alice hastily “but i’m not looking  eggs   happens  if i was i shouldn’t want yours i don’t like them raw” “well  off then” said  pigeon   sulky tone   settled down again into  nest alice crouched down among  trees  well  she could  her neck kept getting entangled among  branches  every now  then she had  stop  untwist it after  while she remembered  she still held  pieces  mushroom  her hands  she set  work very carefully nibbling first  one  then   other  growing sometimes taller  sometimes shorter until she had succeeded  bringing herself down  her usual height it  so long since she had been anything near  right size   felt quite strange  first but she got used     few minutes  began talking  herself  usual “come there’s half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are i’m never sure what i’m going  be  one minute  another however i’ve got back  my right size  next thing is  get into  beautiful garden—how is    done i wonder” as she said this she came suddenly upon  open place   little house   about four feet high “whoever lives there” thought alice “it’ll never do  come upon them this size why i should frighten them out  their wits” so she began nibbling   righthand bit again  did not venture  go near  house till she had brought herself down  nine inches high chapter vi pig  pepper for  minute or two she stood looking   house  wondering what  do next when suddenly  footman  livery came running out   wood—she considered him    footman because    livery otherwise judging  his face only she would have called him  fish—and rapped loudly   door  his knuckles it  opened  another footman  livery   round face  large eyes like  frog  both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair  curled all over their heads she felt very curious  know what   all about  crept  little way out   wood  listen the fishfootman began  producing  under his arm  great letter nearly  large  himself  this  handed over   other saying   solemn tone “for  duchess an invitation   queen  play croquet” the frogfootman repeated   same solemn tone only changing  order   words  little “from  queen an invitation   duchess  play croquet” then they both bowed low  their curls got entangled together alice laughed so much  this  she had  run back into  wood  fear  their hearing her  when she next peeped out  fishfootman  gone   other  sitting   ground near  door staring stupidly up into  sky alice went timidly up   door  knocked “there’s no sort  use  knocking” said  footman “and   two reasons first because i’m   same side   door  you are secondly because they’re making such  noise inside no one could possibly hear you” and certainly there was  most extraordinary noise going  within—a constant howling  sneezing  every now  then  great crash  if  dish or kettle had been broken  pieces “please then” said alice “how am i  get in” “there might  some sense  your knocking”  footman went  without attending  her “if we had  door between us for instance if you  inside you might knock  i could let you out you know” he  looking up into  sky all  time   speaking  this alice thought decidedly uncivil “but perhaps  can’t help it” she said  herself “his eyes  so very nearly   top  his head but  any rate  might answer questions—how am i  get in” she repeated aloud “i shall sit here”  footman remarked “till tomorrow—” at this moment  door   house opened   large plate came skimming out straight   footman’s head  just grazed his nose  broke  pieces against one   trees behind him “—or next day maybe”  footman continued   same tone exactly  if nothing had happened “how am i  get in” asked alice again   louder tone “are you  get   all” said  footman “that’s  first question you know” it was no doubt only alice did not like   told so “it’s really dreadful” she muttered  herself “the way all  creatures argue it’s enough  drive one crazy” the footman seemed  think this  good opportunity  repeating his remark  variations “i shall sit here”  said “on  off  days  days” “but what am i  do” said alice “anything you like” said  footman  began whistling “oh there’s no use  talking  him” said alice desperately “he’s perfectly idiotic” and she opened  door  went in the door led right into  large kitchen which  full  smoke  one end   other  duchess  sitting   threelegged stool   middle nursing  baby  cook  leaning over  fire stirring  large cauldron which seemed   full  soup “there’s certainly too much pepper   soup” alice said  herself  well  she could  sneezing there  certainly too much     air even  duchess sneezed occasionally     baby   sneezing  howling alternately without  moment’s pause the only things   kitchen  did not sneeze   cook   large cat which  sitting   hearth  grinning  ear  ear “please would you tell me” said alice  little timidly  she  not quite sure whether   good manners  her  speak first “why your cat grins like that” “it’s  cheshire cat” said  duchess “and that’s why pig” she said  last word  such sudden violence  alice quite jumped but she saw  another moment    addressed   baby  not  her so she took courage  went  again— “i didn’t know  cheshire cats always grinned  fact i didn’t know  cats could grin” “they all can” said  duchess “and most  ’em do” “i don’t know  any  do” alice said very politely feeling quite pleased  have got into  conversation “you don’t know much” said  duchess “and that’s  fact” alice did not  all like  tone  this remark  thought  would   well  introduce some other subject  conversation while she  trying  fix  one  cook took  cauldron  soup off  fire   once set  work throwing everything within her reach   duchess   baby—the fireirons came first then followed  shower  saucepans plates  dishes the duchess took no notice  them even when they hit her   baby  howling so much already    quite impossible  say whether  blows hurt  or not “oh please mind what you’re doing” cried alice jumping up  down   agony  terror “oh there goes his precious nose”   unusually large saucepan flew close  it  very nearly carried  off “if everybody minded their own business”  duchess said   hoarse growl “the world would go round  deal faster than  does” “which would not   advantage” said alice who felt very glad  get  opportunity  showing off  little  her knowledge “just think  what work  would make   day  night you see  earth takes twentyfour hours  turn round   axis—” “talking  axes” said  duchess “chop off her head” alice glanced rather anxiously   cook  see if she meant  take  hint but  cook  busily stirring  soup  seemed not   listening so she went  again “twentyfour hours i think or   twelve i—” “oh don’t bother me” said  duchess “i never could abide figures” and   she began nursing her child again singing  sort  lullaby    she did so  giving   violent shake   end  every line “speak roughly  your little boy and beat him when  sneezes he only does   annoy because  knows  teases” chorus in which  cook   baby joined “wow wow wow” while  duchess sang  second verse   song she kept tossing  baby violently up  down   poor little thing howled so  alice could hardly hear  words— “i speak severely  my boy i beat him when  sneezes for  can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when  pleases” chorus “wow wow wow” “here you may nurse   bit if you like”  duchess said  alice flinging  baby  her  she spoke “i must go  get ready  play croquet   queen”  she hurried out   room the cook threw  fryingpan after her  she went out but  just missed her alice caught  baby  some difficulty     queershaped little creature  held out  arms  legs  all directions “just like  starfish” thought alice the poor little thing  snorting like  steamengine when she caught it  kept doubling itself up  straightening itself out again so  altogether   first minute or two    much  she could do  hold it as soon  she had made out  proper way  nursing it which   twist  up into  sort  knot  then keep tight hold   right ear  left foot so   prevent  undoing itself she carried  out into  open air “if i don’t take this child away  me” thought alice “they’re sure  kill    day or two wouldn’t   murder  leave  behind” she said  last words out loud   little thing grunted  reply it had left off sneezing  this time “don’t grunt” said alice “that’s not  all  proper way  expressing yourself” the baby grunted again  alice looked very anxiously into  face  see what   matter  it there could  no doubt   had  very turnup nose much more like  snout than  real nose also  eyes  getting extremely small   baby altogether alice did not like  look   thing  all “but perhaps   only sobbing” she thought  looked into  eyes again  see if there  any tears no there  no tears “if you’re going  turn into  pig my dear” said alice seriously “i’ll have nothing more  do  you mind now” the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted   impossible  say which  they went   some while  silence alice  just beginning  think  herself “now what am i  do  this creature when i get  home” when  grunted again so violently  she looked down into  face  some alarm this time there could  no mistake about it   neither more nor less than  pig  she felt   would  quite absurd  her  carry  further so she set  little creature down  felt quite relieved  see  trot away quietly into  wood “if  had grown up” she said  herself “it would have made  dreadfully ugly child but  makes rather  handsome pig i think” and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well  pigs   just saying  herself “if one only knew  right way  change them—” when she   little startled  seeing  cheshire cat sitting   bough   tree  few yards off the cat only grinned when  saw alice it looked goodnatured she thought still  had very long claws   great many teeth so she felt   ought   treated  respect “cheshire puss” she began rather timidly  she did not  all know whether  would like  name however  only grinned  little wider “come it’s pleased so far” thought alice  she went on “would you tell me please which way i ought  go  here” “that depends  good deal  where you want  get to” said  cat “i don’t much care where—” said alice “then  doesn’t matter which way you go” said  cat “—so long  i get somewhere” alice added   explanation “oh you’re sure  do that” said  cat “if you only walk long enough” alice felt  this could not  denied so she tried another question “what sort  people live about here” “in that direction”  cat said waving  right paw round “lives  hatter   that direction” waving  other paw “lives  march hare visit either you like they’re both mad” “but i don’t want  go among mad people” alice remarked “oh you can’t help that” said  cat “we’re all mad here i’m mad you’re mad” “how do you know i’m mad” said alice “you must be” said  cat “or you wouldn’t have come here” alice didn’t think  proved   all however she went  “and how do you know  you’re mad” “to begin with” said  cat “a dog’s not mad you grant that” “i suppose so” said alice “well then”  cat went on “you see  dog growls when it’s angry  wags  tail when it’s pleased now i growl when i’m pleased  wag my tail when i’m angry therefore i’m mad” “i call  purring not growling” said alice “call  what you like” said  cat “do you play croquet   queen today” “i should like  very much” said alice “but i haven’t been invited yet” “you’ll see me there” said  cat  vanished alice  not much surprised  this she  getting so used  queer things happening while she  looking   place where  had been  suddenly appeared again “bythebye what became   baby” said  cat “i’d nearly forgotten  ask” “it turned into  pig” alice quietly said just  if  had come back   natural way “i thought  would” said  cat  vanished again alice waited  little half expecting  see  again but  did not appear  after  minute or two she walked    direction  which  march hare  said  live “i’ve seen hatters before” she said  herself “the march hare   much  most interesting  perhaps  this  may  won’t  raving mad—at least not so mad     march” as she said this she looked up  there   cat again sitting   branch   tree “did you say pig or fig” said  cat “i said pig” replied alice “and i wish you wouldn’t keep appearing  vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy” “all right” said  cat  this time  vanished quite slowly beginning   end   tail  ending   grin which remained some time after  rest   had gone “well i’ve often seen  cat without  grin” thought alice “but  grin without  cat it’s  most curious thing i ever saw  my life” she had not gone much farther before she came  sight   house   march hare she thought  must   right house because  chimneys  shaped like ears   roof  thatched  fur it  so large  house  she did not like  go nearer till she had nibbled some more   lefthand bit  mushroom  raised herself  about two feet high even then she walked up towards  rather timidly saying  herself “suppose  should  raving mad after all i almost wish i’d gone  see  hatter instead” chapter vii a mad teaparty there   table set out under  tree  front   house   march hare   hatter  having tea  it  dormouse  sitting between them fast asleep   other two  using    cushion resting their elbows  it  talking over  head “very uncomfortable   dormouse” thought alice “only  it’s asleep i suppose  doesn’t mind” the table   large one but  three  all crowded together  one corner  it “no room no room” they cried out when they saw alice coming “there’s plenty  room” said alice indignantly  she sat down   large armchair  one end   table “have some wine”  march hare said   encouraging tone alice looked all round  table but there  nothing   but tea “i don’t see any wine” she remarked “there isn’t any” said  march hare “then  wasn’t very civil  you  offer it” said alice angrily “it wasn’t very civil  you  sit down without being invited” said  march hare “i didn’t know   your table” said alice “it’s laid   great many more than three” “your hair wants cutting” said  hatter he had been looking  alice  some time  great curiosity  this  his first speech “you should learn not  make personal remarks” alice said  some severity “it’s very rude” the hatter opened his eyes very wide  hearing this but all  said was “why   raven like  writingdesk” “come we shall have some fun now” thought alice “i’m glad they’ve begun asking riddles—i believe i can guess that” she added aloud “do you mean  you think you can find out  answer  it” said  march hare “exactly so” said alice “then you should say what you mean”  march hare went on “i do” alice hastily replied “at least—at least i mean what i say—that’s  same thing you know” “not  same thing  bit” said  hatter “you might just  well say  ‘i see what i eat’   same thing  ‘i eat what i see’” “you might just  well say” added  march hare “that ‘i like what i get’   same thing  ‘i get what i like’” “you might just  well say” added  dormouse who seemed   talking  his sleep “that ‘i breathe when i sleep’   same thing  ‘i sleep when i breathe’” “it is  same thing  you” said  hatter  here  conversation dropped   party sat silent   minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens  writingdesks which wasn’t much the hatter   first  break  silence “what day   month  it”  said turning  alice  had taken his watch out  his pocket   looking   uneasily shaking  every now  then  holding   his ear alice considered  little  then said “the fourth” “two days wrong” sighed  hatter “i told you butter wouldn’t suit  works”  added looking angrily   march hare “it   best butter”  march hare meekly replied “yes but some crumbs must have got   well”  hatter grumbled “you shouldn’t have put     breadknife” the march hare took  watch  looked   gloomily then  dipped  into his cup  tea  looked   again but  could think  nothing better  say than his first remark “it   best butter you know” alice had been looking over his shoulder  some curiosity “what  funny watch” she remarked “it tells  day   month  doesn’t tell what o’clock  is” “why should it” muttered  hatter “does your watch tell you what year  is” “of course not” alice replied very readily “but that’s because  stays  same year  such  long time together” “which  just  case  mine” said  hatter alice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatter’s remark seemed  have no sort  meaning  it  yet   certainly english “i don’t quite understand you” she said  politely  she could “the dormouse  asleep again” said  hatter   poured  little hot tea upon  nose the dormouse shook  head impatiently  said without opening  eyes “of course  course just what i  going  remark myself” “have you guessed  riddle yet”  hatter said turning  alice again “no i give  up” alice replied “what’s  answer” “i haven’t  slightest idea” said  hatter “nor i” said  march hare alice sighed wearily “i think you might do something better   time” she said “than waste   asking riddles  have no answers” “if you knew time  well  i do” said  hatter “you wouldn’t talk about wasting it it’s him” “i don’t know what you mean” said alice “of course you don’t”  hatter said tossing his head contemptuously “i dare say you never even spoke  time” “perhaps not” alice cautiously replied “but i know i have  beat time when i learn music” “ah  accounts  it” said  hatter “he won’t stand beating now if you only kept  good terms  him he’d do almost anything you liked   clock for instance suppose   nine o’clock   morning just time  begin lessons you’d only have  whisper  hint  time  round goes  clock   twinkling halfpast one time  dinner” “i only wish  was”  march hare said  itself   whisper “that would  grand certainly” said alice thoughtfully “but then—i shouldn’t  hungry  it you know” “not  first perhaps” said  hatter “but you could keep   halfpast one  long  you liked” “is   way you manage” alice asked the hatter shook his head mournfully “not i”  replied “we quarrelled last march—just before he went mad you know—” pointing  his tea spoon   march hare “—it    great concert given   queen  hearts  i had  sing ‘twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what you’re at’ you know  song perhaps” “i’ve heard something like it” said alice “it goes on you know”  hatter continued “in this way— ‘up above  world you fly like  teatray   sky twinkle twinkle—’” here  dormouse shook itself  began singing   sleep “twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle—”  went  so long  they had  pinch   make  stop “well i’d hardly finished  first verse” said  hatter “when  queen jumped up  bawled out ‘he’s murdering  time off  his head’” “how dreadfully savage” exclaimed alice “and ever since that”  hatter went    mournful tone “he won’t do  thing i ask it’s always six o’clock now” a bright idea came into alice’s head “is   reason so many teathings  put out here” she asked “yes that’s it” said  hatter   sigh “it’s always teatime  we’ve no time  wash  things between whiles” “then you keep moving round i suppose” said alice “exactly so” said  hatter “as  things get used up” “but what happens when you come   beginning again” alice ventured  ask “suppose we change  subject”  march hare interrupted yawning “i’m getting tired  this i vote  young lady tells us  story” “i’m afraid i don’t know one” said alice rather alarmed   proposal “then  dormouse shall” they both cried “wake up dormouse” and they pinched   both sides  once the dormouse slowly opened his eyes “i wasn’t asleep”  said   hoarse feeble voice “i heard every word you fellows  saying” “tell us  story” said  march hare “yes please do” pleaded alice “and  quick about it” added  hatter “or you’ll  asleep again before it’s done” “once upon  time there  three little sisters”  dormouse began   great hurry “and their names  elsie lacie  tillie  they lived   bottom   well—” “what did they live on” said alice who always took  great interest  questions  eating  drinking “they lived  treacle” said  dormouse after thinking  minute or two “they couldn’t have done that you know” alice gently remarked “they’d have been ill” “so they were” said  dormouse “very ill” alice tried  fancy  herself what such  extraordinary ways  living would  like but  puzzled her too much so she went on “but why did they live   bottom   well” “take some more tea”  march hare said  alice very earnestly “i’ve had nothing yet” alice replied   offended tone “so i can’t take more” “you mean you can’t take less” said  hatter “it’s very easy  take more than nothing” “nobody asked your opinion” said alice “who’s making personal remarks now”  hatter asked triumphantly alice did not quite know what  say  this so she helped herself  some tea  breadandbutter  then turned   dormouse  repeated her question “why did they live   bottom   well” the dormouse again took  minute or two  think about it  then said “it   treaclewell” “there’s no such thing” alice  beginning very angrily but  hatter   march hare went “sh sh”   dormouse sulkily remarked “if you can’t  civil you’d better finish  story  yourself” “no please go on” alice said very humbly “i won’t interrupt again i dare say there may  one” “one indeed” said  dormouse indignantly however  consented  go on “and so these three little sisters—they  learning  draw you know—” “what did they draw” said alice quite forgetting her promise “treacle” said  dormouse without considering  all this time “i want  clean cup” interrupted  hatter “let’s all move one place on” he moved    spoke   dormouse followed him  march hare moved into  dormouse’s place  alice rather unwillingly took  place   march hare the hatter   only one who got any advantage   change  alice   good deal worse off than before   march hare had just upset  milkjug into his plate alice did not wish  offend  dormouse again so she began very cautiously “but i don’t understand where did they draw  treacle from” “you can draw water out   waterwell” said  hatter “so i should think you could draw treacle out   treaclewell—eh stupid” “but they  in  well” alice said   dormouse not choosing  notice this last remark “of course they were” said  dormouse “—well in” this answer so confused poor alice  she let  dormouse go   some time without interrupting it “they  learning  draw”  dormouse went on yawning  rubbing  eyes    getting very sleepy “and they drew all manner  things—everything  begins   m—” “why   m” said alice “why not” said  march hare alice  silent the dormouse had closed  eyes  this time   going off into  doze but  being pinched   hatter  woke up again   little shriek  went on “—that begins   m such  mousetraps   moon  memory  muchness—you know you say things  “much   muchness”—did you ever see such  thing   drawing   muchness” “really now you ask me” said alice very much confused “i don’t think—” “then you shouldn’t talk” said  hatter this piece  rudeness  more than alice could bear she got up  great disgust  walked off  dormouse fell asleep instantly  neither   others took  least notice  her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping  they would call after her  last time she saw them they  trying  put  dormouse into  teapot “at any rate i’ll never go there again” said alice  she picked her way through  wood “it’s  stupidest teaparty i ever    all my life” just  she said this she noticed  one   trees had  door leading right into it “that’s very curious” she thought “but everything’s curious today i think i may  well go   once” and  she went once more she found herself   long hall  close   little glass table “now i’ll manage better this time” she said  herself  began  taking  little golden key  unlocking  door  led into  garden then she went  work nibbling   mushroom she had kept  piece    her pocket till she  about  foot high then she walked down  little passage  then—she found herself  last   beautiful garden among  bright flowerbeds   cool fountains chapter viii the queen’s croquetground a large rosetree stood near  entrance   garden  roses growing    white but there  three gardeners  it busily painting them red alice thought this  very curious thing  she went nearer  watch them  just  she came up  them she heard one  them say “look out now five don’t go splashing paint over me like that” “i couldn’t help it” said five   sulky tone “seven jogged my elbow” on which seven looked up  said “that’s right five always lay  blame  others” “you’d better not talk” said five “i heard  queen say only yesterday you deserved   beheaded” “what for” said  one who had spoken first “that’s none  your business two” said seven “yes  is his business” said five “and i’ll tell him—it   bringing  cook tuliproots instead  onions” seven flung down his brush  had just begun “well  all  unjust things—” when his eye chanced  fall upon alice  she stood watching them   checked himself suddenly  others looked round also  all  them bowed low “would you tell me” said alice  little timidly “why you  painting those roses” five  seven said nothing but looked  two two began   low voice “why  fact is you see miss this here ought  have been  red rosetree  we put  white one   mistake  if  queen   find  out we should all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss we’re doing our best afore she comes to—” at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across  garden called out “the queen the queen”   three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces there   sound  many footsteps  alice looked round eager  see  queen first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these  all shaped like  three gardeners oblong  flat  their hands  feet   corners next  ten courtiers these  ornamented all over  diamonds  walked two  two   soldiers did after these came  royal children there  ten  them   little dears came jumping merrily along hand  hand  couples they  all ornamented  hearts next came  guests mostly kings  queens  among them alice recognised  white rabbit   talking   hurried nervous manner smiling  everything   said  went  without noticing her then followed  knave  hearts carrying  king’s crown   crimson velvet cushion and last  all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts alice  rather doubtful whether she ought not  lie down  her face like  three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard  such  rule  processions “and besides what would   use   procession” thought she “if people had all  lie down upon their faces so  they couldn’t see it” so she stood still where she was  waited when  procession came opposite  alice they all stopped  looked  her   queen said severely “who  this” she said    knave  hearts who only bowed  smiled  reply “idiot” said  queen tossing her head impatiently and turning  alice she went on “what’s your name child” “my name  alice so please your majesty” said alice very politely but she added  herself “why they’re only  pack  cards after all i needn’t  afraid  them” “and who  these” said  queen pointing   three gardeners who  lying round  rosetree for you see  they  lying  their faces   pattern  their backs   same   rest   pack she could not tell whether they  gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three  her own children “how should i know” said alice surprised  her own courage “it’s no business  mine” the queen turned crimson  fury and after glaring  her   moment like  wild beast screamed “off  her head off—” “nonsense” said alice very loudly  decidedly   queen  silent the king laid his hand upon her arm  timidly said “consider my dear she  only  child” the queen turned angrily away  him  said   knave “turn them over” the knave did so very carefully  one foot “get up” said  queen   shrill loud voice   three gardeners instantly jumped up  began bowing   king  queen  royal children  everybody else “leave off that” screamed  queen “you make me giddy” and then turning   rosetree she went on “what have you been doing here” “may  please your majesty” said two   very humble tone going down  one knee   spoke “we  trying—” “i see” said  queen who had meanwhile been examining  roses “off  their heads”   procession moved on three   soldiers remaining behind  execute  unfortunate gardeners who ran  alice  protection “you shan’t  beheaded” said alice  she put them into  large flowerpot  stood near the three soldiers wandered about   minute or two looking  them  then quietly marched off after  others “are their heads off” shouted  queen “their heads  gone if  please your majesty”  soldiers shouted  reply “that’s right” shouted  queen “can you play croquet” the soldiers  silent  looked  alice   question  evidently meant  her “yes” shouted alice “come on then” roared  queen  alice joined  procession wondering very much what would happen next “it’s—it’s  very fine day” said  timid voice  her side she  walking   white rabbit who  peeping anxiously into her face “very” said alice “—where’s  duchess” “hush hush” said  rabbit   low hurried tone he looked anxiously over his shoulder   spoke  then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close  her ear  whispered “she’s under sentence  execution” “what for” said alice “did you say ‘what  pity’”  rabbit asked “no i didn’t” said alice “i don’t think it’s  all  pity i said ‘what for’” “she boxed  queen’s ears—”  rabbit began alice gave  little scream  laughter “oh hush”  rabbit whispered   frightened tone “the queen  hear you you see she came rather late   queen said—” “get  your places” shouted  queen   voice  thunder  people began running about  all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down   minute or two   game began alice thought she had never seen such  curious croquetground  her life   all ridges  furrows  balls  live hedgehogs  mallets live flamingoes   soldiers had  double themselves up   stand  their hands  feet  make  arches the chief difficulty alice found  first   managing her flamingo she succeeded  getting  body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm   legs hanging down but generally just  she had got  neck nicely straightened out   going  give  hedgehog  blow   head  would twist itself round  look up  her face  such  puzzled expression  she could not help bursting out laughing  when she had got  head down   going  begin again   very provoking  find   hedgehog had unrolled itself     act  crawling away besides all this there  generally  ridge or furrow   way wherever she wanted  send  hedgehog to and   doubledup soldiers  always getting up  walking off  other parts   ground alice soon came   conclusion     very difficult game indeed the players all played  once without waiting  turns quarrelling all  while  fighting   hedgehogs    very short time  queen    furious passion  went stamping about  shouting “off  his head” or “off  her head” about once   minute alice began  feel very uneasy   sure she had not  yet had any dispute   queen but she knew   might happen any minute “and then” thought she “what would become  me they’re dreadfully fond  beheading people here  great wonder is  there’s any one left alive” she  looking about  some way  escape  wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed  curious appearance   air  puzzled her very much  first but after watching   minute or two she made  out    grin  she said  herself “it’s  cheshire cat now i shall have somebody  talk to” “how  you getting on” said  cat  soon  there  mouth enough    speak with alice waited till  eyes appeared  then nodded “it’s no use speaking  it” she thought “till  ears have come or  least one  them” in another minute  whole head appeared  then alice put down her flamingo  began  account   game feeling very glad she had someone  listen  her the cat seemed  think  there  enough   now  sight  no more   appeared “i don’t think they play  all fairly” alice began  rather  complaining tone “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and they don’t seem  have any rules  particular  least if there are nobody attends  them—and you’ve no idea how confusing   all  things being alive  instance there’s  arch i’ve got  go through next walking about   other end   ground—and i should have croqueted  queen’s hedgehog just now only  ran away when  saw mine coming” “how do you like  queen” said  cat   low voice “not  all” said alice “she’s so extremely—” just then she noticed   queen  close behind her listening so she went on “—likely  win  it’s hardly worth while finishing  game” the queen smiled  passed on “who are you talking to” said  king going up  alice  looking   cat’s head  great curiosity “it’s  friend  mine—a cheshire cat” said alice “allow me  introduce it” “i don’t like  look    all” said  king “however  may kiss my hand if  likes” “i’d rather not”  cat remarked “don’t  impertinent” said  king “and don’t look  me like that” he got behind alice   spoke “a cat may look   king” said alice “i’ve read   some book but i don’t remember where” “well  must  removed” said  king very decidedly   called  queen who  passing   moment “my dear i wish you would have this cat removed” the queen had only one way  settling all difficulties great or small “off  his head” she said without even looking round “i’ll fetch  executioner myself” said  king eagerly   hurried off alice thought she might  well go back  see how  game  going on  she heard  queen’s voice   distance screaming  passion she had already heard her sentence three   players   executed  having missed their turns  she did not like  look  things  all   game   such confusion  she never knew whether   her turn or not so she went  search  her hedgehog the hedgehog  engaged   fight  another hedgehog which seemed  alice  excellent opportunity  croqueting one  them   other  only difficulty was  her flamingo  gone across   other side   garden where alice could see  trying   helpless sort  way  fly up into  tree by  time she had caught  flamingo  brought  back  fight  over  both  hedgehogs  out  sight “but  doesn’t matter much” thought alice “as all  arches  gone  this side   ground” so she tucked  away under her arm   might not escape again  went back   little more conversation  her friend when she got back   cheshire cat she  surprised  find quite  large crowd collected round it there   dispute going  between  executioner  king   queen who  all talking  once while all  rest  quite silent  looked very uncomfortable the moment alice appeared she  appealed   all three  settle  question  they repeated their arguments  her though  they all spoke  once she found  very hard indeed  make out exactly what they said the executioner’s argument was  you couldn’t cut off  head unless there   body  cut  off from   had never had  do such  thing before   wasn’t going  begin  his time  life the king’s argument was  anything  had  head could  beheaded   you weren’t  talk nonsense the queen’s argument was  if something wasn’t done about   less than no time she’d have everybody executed all round it  this last remark  had made  whole party look so grave  anxious alice could think  nothing else  say but “it belongs   duchess you’d better ask her about it” “she’s  prison”  queen said   executioner “fetch her here” and  executioner went off like  arrow the cat’s head began fading away  moment   gone and   time  had come back   duchess  had entirely disappeared so  king   executioner ran wildly up  down looking  it while  rest   party went back   game chapter ix the mock turtle’s story “you can’t think how glad i am  see you again you dear old thing” said  duchess  she tucked her arm affectionately into alice’s  they walked off together alice  very glad  find her  such  pleasant temper  thought  herself  perhaps   only  pepper  had made her so savage when they met   kitchen “when i’m  duchess” she said  herself not   very hopeful tone though “i won’t have any pepper  my kitchen at all soup does very well without—maybe it’s always pepper  makes people hottempered” she went on very much pleased  having found out  new kind  rule “and vinegar  makes them sour—and camomile  makes them bitter—and—and barleysugar  such things  make children sweettempered i only wish people knew that then they wouldn’t  so stingy about it you know—” she had quite forgotten  duchess  this time    little startled when she heard her voice close  her ear “you’re thinking about something my dear   makes you forget  talk i can’t tell you just now what  moral   is but i shall remember    bit” “perhaps  hasn’t one” alice ventured  remark “tut tut child” said  duchess “everything’s got  moral if only you can find it” and she squeezed herself up closer  alice’s side  she spoke alice did not much like keeping so close  her first because  duchess  very ugly  secondly because she  exactly  right height  rest her chin upon alice’s shoulder     uncomfortably sharp chin however she did not like   rude so she bore   well  she could “the game’s going  rather better now” she said  way  keeping up  conversation  little “’tis so” said  duchess “and  moral   is—‘oh ’tis love ’tis love  makes  world go round’” “somebody said” alice whispered “that it’s done  everybody minding their own business” “ah well it means much  same thing” said  duchess digging her sharp little chin into alice’s shoulder  she added “and  moral  that is—‘take care   sense   sounds  take care  themselves’” “how fond she   finding morals  things” alice thought  herself “i dare say you’re wondering why i don’t put my arm round your waist”  duchess said after  pause “the reason is  i’m doubtful about  temper  your flamingo shall i try  experiment” “he might bite” alice cautiously replied not feeling  all anxious  have  experiment tried “very true” said  duchess “flamingoes  mustard both bite and  moral   is—‘birds   feather flock together’” “only mustard isn’t  bird” alice remarked “right  usual” said  duchess “what  clear way you have  putting things” “it’s  mineral i think” said alice “of course  is” said  duchess who seemed ready  agree  everything  alice said “there’s  large mustardmine near here and  moral   is—‘the more there   mine  less there   yours’” “oh i know” exclaimed alice who had not attended  this last remark “it’s  vegetable it doesn’t look like one but  is” “i quite agree  you” said  duchess “and  moral   is—‘be what you would seem  be’—or if you’d like  put more simply—‘never imagine yourself not   otherwise than what  might appear  others  what you  or might have been  not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared  them   otherwise’” “i think i should understand  better” alice said very politely “if i had  written down but i can’t quite follow   you say it” “that’s nothing  what i could say if i chose”  duchess replied   pleased tone “pray don’t trouble yourself  say  any longer than that” said alice “oh don’t talk about trouble” said  duchess “i make you  present  everything i’ve said  yet” “a cheap sort  present” thought alice “i’m glad they don’t give birthday presents like that” but she did not venture  say  out loud “thinking again”  duchess asked  another dig  her sharp little chin “i’ve  right  think” said alice sharply  she  beginning  feel  little worried “just about  much right” said  duchess “as pigs have  fly   m—” but here  alice’s great surprise  duchess’s voice died away even   middle  her favourite word ‘moral’   arm   linked into hers began  tremble alice looked up  there stood  queen  front  them  her arms folded frowning like  thunderstorm “a fine day your majesty”  duchess began   low weak voice “now i give you fair warning” shouted  queen stamping   ground  she spoke “either you or your head must  off    about half no time take your choice” the duchess took her choice   gone   moment “let’s go    game”  queen said  alice  alice  too much frightened  say  word but slowly followed her back   croquetground the other guests had taken advantage   queen’s absence   resting   shade however  moment they saw her they hurried back   game  queen merely remarking   moment’s delay would cost them their lives all  time they  playing  queen never left off quarrelling   other players  shouting “off  his head” or “off  her head” those whom she sentenced  taken into custody   soldiers who  course had  leave off being arches  do this so    end  half  hour or so there  no arches left  all  players except  king  queen  alice   custody  under sentence  execution then  queen left off quite out  breath  said  alice “have you seen  mock turtle yet” “no” said alice “i don’t even know what  mock turtle is” “it’s  thing mock turtle soup  made from” said  queen “i never saw one or heard  one” said alice “come on then” said  queen “and  shall tell you his history” as they walked off together alice heard  king say   low voice   company generally “you  all pardoned” “come that’s  good thing” she said  herself  she had felt quite unhappy   number  executions  queen had ordered they very soon came upon  gryphon lying fast asleep   sun if you don’t know what  gryphon is look   picture “up lazy thing” said  queen “and take this young lady  see  mock turtle   hear his history i must go back  see after some executions i have ordered”  she walked off leaving alice alone   gryphon alice did not quite like  look   creature but   whole she thought  would  quite  safe  stay     go after  savage queen so she waited the gryphon sat up  rubbed  eyes then  watched  queen till she  out  sight then  chuckled “what fun” said  gryphon half  itself half  alice “what is  fun” said alice “why she” said  gryphon “it’s all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know come on” “everybody says ‘come on’ here” thought alice  she went slowly after it “i never  so ordered about  all my life never” they had not gone far before they saw  mock turtle   distance sitting sad  lonely   little ledge  rock and  they came nearer alice could hear him sighing  if his heart would break she pitied him deeply “what  his sorrow” she asked  gryphon   gryphon answered very nearly   same words  before “it’s all his fancy that  hasn’t got no sorrow you know come on” so they went up   mock turtle who looked  them  large eyes full  tears but said nothing “this here young lady” said  gryphon “she wants   know your history she do” “i’ll tell  her” said  mock turtle   deep hollow tone “sit down both  you  don’t speak  word till i’ve finished” so they sat down  nobody spoke  some minutes alice thought  herself “i don’t see how  can ever finish if  doesn’t begin” but she waited patiently “once” said  mock turtle  last   deep sigh “i   real turtle” these words  followed   very long silence broken only   occasional exclamation  “hjckrrh”   gryphon   constant heavy sobbing   mock turtle alice  very nearly getting up  saying “thank you sir  your interesting story” but she could not help thinking there must  more  come so she sat still  said nothing “when we  little”  mock turtle went   last more calmly though still sobbing  little now  then “we went  school   sea the master   old turtle—we used  call him tortoise—” “why did you call him tortoise if  wasn’t one” alice asked “we called him tortoise because  taught us” said  mock turtle angrily “really you  very dull” “you ought   ashamed  yourself  asking such  simple question” added  gryphon  then they both sat silent  looked  poor alice who felt ready  sink into  earth at last  gryphon said   mock turtle “drive on old fellow don’t  all day about it”   went   these words “yes we went  school   sea though you mayn’t believe it—” “i never said i didn’t” interrupted alice “you did” said  mock turtle “hold your tongue” added  gryphon before alice could speak again the mock turtle went on “we had  best  educations—in fact we went  school every day—” “i’ve been   dayschool too” said alice “you needn’t  so proud  all that” “with extras” asked  mock turtle  little anxiously “yes” said alice “we learned french  music” “and washing” said  mock turtle “certainly not” said alice indignantly “ah then yours wasn’t  really good school” said  mock turtle   tone  great relief “now  ours they had   end   bill ‘french music and washing—extra’” “you couldn’t have wanted  much” said alice “living   bottom   sea” “i couldn’t afford  learn it” said  mock turtle   sigh “i only took  regular course” “what  that” inquired alice “reeling  writhing  course  begin with”  mock turtle replied “and then  different branches  arithmetic—ambition distraction uglification  derision” “i never heard  ‘uglification’” alice ventured  say “what  it” the gryphon lifted up both  paws  surprise “what never heard  uglifying”  exclaimed “you know what  beautify is i suppose” “yes” said alice doubtfully “it means—to—make—anything—prettier” “well then”  gryphon went on “if you don’t know what  uglify is you are  simpleton” alice did not feel encouraged  ask any more questions about it so she turned   mock turtle  said “what else had you  learn” “well there  mystery”  mock turtle replied counting off  subjects  his flappers “—mystery ancient  modern  seaography then drawling—the drawlingmaster   old congereel  used  come once  week he taught us drawling stretching  fainting  coils” “what  that like” said alice “well i can’t show  you myself”  mock turtle said “i’m too stiff and  gryphon never learnt it” “hadn’t time” said  gryphon “i went   classics master though he   old crab he was” “i never went  him”  mock turtle said   sigh “he taught laughing  grief they used  say” “so  did so  did” said  gryphon sighing  his turn  both creatures hid their faces  their paws “and how many hours  day did you do lessons” said alice   hurry  change  subject “ten hours  first day” said  mock turtle “nine  next  so on” “what  curious plan” exclaimed alice “that’s  reason they’re called lessons”  gryphon remarked “because they lessen  day  day” this  quite  new idea  alice  she thought  over  little before she made her next remark “then  eleventh day must have been  holiday” “of course  was” said  mock turtle “and how did you manage   twelfth” alice went  eagerly “that’s enough about lessons”  gryphon interrupted   very decided tone “tell her something about  games now” chapter x the lobster quadrille the mock turtle sighed deeply  drew  back  one flapper across his eyes he looked  alice  tried  speak but   minute or two sobs choked his voice “same  if  had  bone  his throat” said  gryphon   set  work shaking him  punching him   back at last  mock turtle recovered his voice and  tears running down his cheeks  went  again— “you may not have lived much under  sea—” “i haven’t” said alice—“and perhaps you  never even introduced   lobster—” alice began  say “i once tasted—” but checked herself hastily  said “no never” “—so you can have no idea what  delightful thing  lobster quadrille is” “no indeed” said alice “what sort   dance  it” “why” said  gryphon “you first form into  line along  seashore—” “two lines” cried  mock turtle “seals turtles salmon  so on then when you’ve cleared all  jellyfish out   way—” “that generally takes some time” interrupted  gryphon “—you advance twice—” “each   lobster   partner” cried  gryphon “of course”  mock turtle said “advance twice set  partners—” “—change lobsters  retire  same order” continued  gryphon “then you know”  mock turtle went on “you throw the—” “the lobsters” shouted  gryphon   bound into  air “—as far out  sea  you can—” “swim after them” screamed  gryphon “turn  somersault   sea” cried  mock turtle capering wildly about “change lobsters again” yelled  gryphon   top   voice “back  land again  that’s all  first figure” said  mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice   two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly  quietly  looked  alice “it must   very pretty dance” said alice timidly “would you like  see  little  it” said  mock turtle “very much indeed” said alice “come let’s try  first figure” said  mock turtle   gryphon “we can do without lobsters you know which shall sing” “oh you sing” said  gryphon “i’ve forgotten  words” so they began solemnly dancing round  round alice every now  then treading  her toes when they passed too close  waving their forepaws  mark  time while  mock turtle sang this very slowly  sadly— “will you walk  little faster” said  whiting   snail “there’s  porpoise close behind us  he’s treading  my tail see how eagerly  lobsters   turtles all advance they  waiting   shingle—will you come  join  dance will you won’t you  you won’t you  you join  dance will you won’t you  you won’t you won’t you join  dance “you can really have no notion how delightful    when they take us up  throw us   lobsters out  sea” but  snail replied “too far too far”  gave  look askance— said  thanked  whiting kindly but  would not join  dance would not could not would not could not would not join  dance would not could not would not could not could not join  dance “what matters  how far we go” his scaly friend replied “there  another shore you know upon  other side the further off  england  nearer   france— then turn not pale beloved snail but come  join  dance will you won’t you  you won’t you  you join  dance will you won’t you  you won’t you won’t you join  dance” “thank you it’s  very interesting dance  watch” said alice feeling very glad    over  last “and i do so like  curious song about  whiting” “oh    whiting” said  mock turtle “they—you’ve seen them  course” “yes” said alice “i’ve often seen them  dinn—” she checked herself hastily “i don’t know where dinn may be” said  mock turtle “but if you’ve seen them so often  course you know what they’re like” “i believe so” alice replied thoughtfully “they have their tails  their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs” “you’re wrong about  crumbs” said  mock turtle “crumbs would all wash off   sea but they have their tails  their mouths   reason is—” here  mock turtle yawned  shut his eyes—“tell her about  reason  all that”  said   gryphon “the reason is” said  gryphon “that they would go   lobsters   dance so they got thrown out  sea so they had  fall  long way so they got their tails fast  their mouths so they couldn’t get them out again that’s all” “thank you” said alice “it’s very interesting i never knew so much about  whiting before” “i can tell you more than that if you like” said  gryphon “do you know why it’s called  whiting” “i never thought about it” said alice “why” “it does  boots  shoes”  gryphon replied very solemnly alice  thoroughly puzzled “does  boots  shoes” she repeated   wondering tone “why what  your shoes done with” said  gryphon “i mean what makes them so shiny” alice looked down  them  considered  little before she gave her answer “they’re done  blacking i believe” “boots  shoes under  sea”  gryphon went    deep voice “are done   whiting now you know” “and what  they made of” alice asked   tone  great curiosity “soles  eels  course”  gryphon replied rather impatiently “any shrimp could have told you that” “if i’d been  whiting” said alice whose thoughts  still running   song “i’d have said   porpoise ‘keep back please we don’t want you  us’” “they  obliged  have him  them”  mock turtle said “no wise fish would go anywhere without  porpoise” “wouldn’t  really” said alice   tone  great surprise “of course not” said  mock turtle “why if  fish came  me  told me   going  journey i should say ‘with what porpoise’” “don’t you mean ‘purpose’” said alice “i mean what i say”  mock turtle replied   offended tone and  gryphon added “come let’s hear some  your adventures” “i could tell you my adventures—beginning  this morning” said alice  little timidly “but it’s no use going back  yesterday because i   different person then” “explain all that” said  mock turtle “no no the adventures first” said  gryphon   impatient tone “explanations take such  dreadful time” so alice began telling them her adventures   time when she first saw  white rabbit she   little nervous about  just  first  two creatures got so close  her one  each side  opened their eyes  mouths so very wide but she gained courage  she went on her listeners  perfectly quiet till she got   part about her repeating “you  old father william”   caterpillar   words all coming different  then  mock turtle drew  long breath  said “that’s very curious” “it’s all about  curious   can be” said  gryphon “it all came different”  mock turtle repeated thoughtfully “i should like  hear her try  repeat something now tell her  begin” he looked   gryphon  if  thought  had some kind  authority over alice “stand up  repeat ‘’tis  voice   sluggard’” said  gryphon “how  creatures order one about  make one repeat lessons” thought alice “i might  well   school  once” however she got up  began  repeat it but her head  so full   lobster quadrille  she hardly knew what she  saying   words came very queer indeed— “’tis  voice   lobster i heard him declare “you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair” as  duck   eyelids so   his nose trims his belt  his buttons  turns out his toes” later editions continued  follows when  sands  all dry   gay   lark and  talk  contemptuous tones   shark but when  tide rises  sharks  around his voice   timid  tremulous sound “that’s different  what i used  say when i   child” said  gryphon “well i never heard  before” said  mock turtle “but  sounds uncommon nonsense” alice said nothing she had sat down  her face  her hands wondering if anything would ever happen   natural way again “i should like  have  explained” said  mock turtle “she can’t explain it” said  gryphon hastily “go    next verse” “but about his toes”  mock turtle persisted “how could  turn them out  his nose you know” “it’s  first position  dancing” alice said but  dreadfully puzzled   whole thing  longed  change  subject “go    next verse”  gryphon repeated impatiently “it begins ‘i passed  his garden’” alice did not dare  disobey though she felt sure  would all come wrong  she went    trembling voice— “i passed  his garden  marked  one eye how  owl   panther  sharing  pie—” later editions continued  follows the panther took piecrust  gravy  meat while  owl had  dish   share   treat when  pie  all finished  owl   boon was kindly permitted  pocket  spoon while  panther received knife  fork   growl and concluded  banquet— “what is  use  repeating all  stuff”  mock turtle interrupted “if you don’t explain   you go on it’s  far  most confusing thing i ever heard” “yes i think you’d better leave off” said  gryphon  alice  only too glad  do so “shall we try another figure   lobster quadrille”  gryphon went on “or would you like  mock turtle  sing you  song” “oh  song please if  mock turtle would  so kind” alice replied so eagerly   gryphon said   rather offended tone “hm no accounting  tastes sing her ‘turtle soup’  you old fellow” the mock turtle sighed deeply  began   voice sometimes choked  sobs  sing this— “beautiful soup so rich  green waiting   hot tureen who  such dainties would not stoop soup   evening beautiful soup soup   evening beautiful soup beau—ootiful soo—oop beau—ootiful soo—oop soo—oop   e—e—evening beautiful beautiful soup “beautiful soup who cares  fish game or any other dish who would not give all else  two p ennyworth only  beautiful soup pennyworth only  beautiful soup beau—ootiful soo—oop beau—ootiful soo—oop soo—oop   e—e—evening beautiful beauti—ful soup” “chorus again” cried  gryphon   mock turtle had just begun  repeat it when  cry  “the trial’s beginning”  heard   distance “come on” cried  gryphon and taking alice   hand  hurried off without waiting   end   song “what trial  it” alice panted  she ran but  gryphon only answered “come on”  ran  faster while more  more faintly came carried   breeze  followed them  melancholy words— “soo—oop   e—e—evening beautiful beautiful soup” chapter xi who stole  tarts the king  queen  hearts  seated  their throne when they arrived   great crowd assembled about them—all sorts  little birds  beasts  well   whole pack  cards  knave  standing before them  chains   soldier  each side  guard him  near  king   white rabbit   trumpet  one hand   scroll  parchment   other in  very middle   court   table   large dish  tarts upon it they looked so good   made alice quite hungry  look  them—“i wish they’d get  trial done” she thought “and hand round  refreshments” but there seemed   no chance  this so she began looking  everything about her  pass away  time alice had never been   court  justice before but she had read about them  books  she  quite pleased  find  she knew  name  nearly everything there “that’s  judge” she said  herself “because  his great wig” the judge   way   king    wore his crown over  wig look   frontispiece if you want  see how  did it  did not look  all comfortable    certainly not becoming “and that’s  jurybox” thought alice “and those twelve creatures” she  obliged  say “creatures” you see because some  them  animals  some  birds “i suppose they   jurors” she said this last word two or three times over  herself being rather proud  it  she thought  rightly too  very few little girls  her age knew  meaning    all however “jurymen” would have done just  well the twelve jurors  all writing very busily  slates “what  they doing” alice whispered   gryphon “they can’t have anything  put down yet before  trial’s begun” “they’re putting down their names”  gryphon whispered  reply “for fear they should forget them before  end   trial” “stupid things” alice began   loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily   white rabbit cried out “silence   court”   king put  his spectacles  looked anxiously round  make out who  talking alice could see  well  if she  looking over their shoulders  all  jurors  writing down “stupid things”  their slates  she could even make out  one  them didn’t know how  spell “stupid”    had  ask his neighbour  tell him “a nice muddle their slates’ll   before  trial’s over” thought alice one   jurors had  pencil  squeaked this  course alice could not stand  she went round  court  got behind him  very soon found  opportunity  taking  away she did  so quickly   poor little juror it  bill  lizard could not make out  all what had become  it so after hunting all about  it   obliged  write  one finger   rest   day  this   very little use   left no mark   slate “herald read  accusation” said  king on this  white rabbit blew three blasts   trumpet  then unrolled  parchment scroll  read  follows— “the queen  hearts she made some tarts all   summer day the knave  hearts  stole those tarts and took them quite away” “consider your verdict”  king said   jury “not yet not yet”  rabbit hastily interrupted “there’s  great deal  come before that” “call  first witness” said  king   white rabbit blew three blasts   trumpet  called out “first witness” the first witness   hatter he came    teacup  one hand   piece  breadandbutter   other “i beg pardon your majesty”  began “for bringing these in but i hadn’t quite finished my tea when i  sent for” “you ought  have finished” said  king “when did you begin” the hatter looked   march hare who had followed him into  court arminarm   dormouse “fourteenth  march i think  was”  said “fifteenth” said  march hare “sixteenth” added  dormouse “write  down”  king said   jury   jury eagerly wrote down all three dates  their slates  then added them up  reduced  answer  shillings  pence “take off your hat”  king said   hatter “it isn’t mine” said  hatter “stolen”  king exclaimed turning   jury who instantly made  memorandum   fact “i keep them  sell”  hatter added   explanation “i’ve none  my own i’m  hatter” here  queen put  her spectacles  began staring   hatter who turned pale  fidgeted “give your evidence” said  king “and don’t  nervous or i’ll have you executed   spot” this did not seem  encourage  witness  all  kept shifting  one foot   other looking uneasily   queen   his confusion  bit  large piece out  his teacup instead   breadandbutter just  this moment alice felt  very curious sensation which puzzled her  good deal until she made out what  was she  beginning  grow larger again  she thought  first she would get up  leave  court but  second thoughts she decided  remain where she   long  there  room  her “i wish you wouldn’t squeeze so” said  dormouse who  sitting next  her “i can hardly breathe” “i can’t help it” said alice very meekly “i’m growing” “you’ve no right  grow here” said  dormouse “don’t talk nonsense” said alice more boldly “you know you’re growing too” “yes but i grow   reasonable pace” said  dormouse “not   ridiculous fashion” and  got up very sulkily  crossed over   other side   court all this time  queen had never left off staring   hatter and just   dormouse crossed  court she said  one   officers   court “bring me  list   singers   last concert”  which  wretched hatter trembled so   shook both his shoes off “give your evidence”  king repeated angrily “or i’ll have you executed whether you’re nervous or not” “i’m  poor man your majesty”  hatter began   trembling voice “—and i hadn’t begun my tea—not above  week or so—and what   breadandbutter getting so thin—and  twinkling   tea—” “the twinkling   what” said  king “it began   tea”  hatter replied “of course twinkling begins   t” said  king sharply “do you take me   dunce go on” “i’m  poor man”  hatter went on “and most things twinkled after that—only  march hare said—” “i didn’t”  march hare interrupted   great hurry “you did” said  hatter “i deny it” said  march hare “he denies it” said  king “leave out  part” “well  any rate  dormouse said—”  hatter went on looking anxiously round  see if  would deny  too but  dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep “after that” continued  hatter “i cut some more breadandbutter—” “but what did  dormouse say” one   jury asked “that i can’t remember” said  hatter “you must remember” remarked  king “or i’ll have you executed” the miserable hatter dropped his teacup  breadandbutter  went down  one knee “i’m  poor man your majesty”  began “you’re  very poor speaker” said  king here one   guineapigs cheered   immediately suppressed   officers   court as   rather  hard word i  just explain  you how   done they had  large canvas bag which tied up   mouth  strings into this they slipped  guineapig head first  then sat upon it “i’m glad i’ve seen  done” thought alice “i’ve so often read   newspapers   end  trials “there  some attempts  applause which  immediately suppressed   officers   court”  i never understood what  meant till now” “if that’s all you know about it you may stand down” continued  king “i can’t go no lower” said  hatter “i’m   floor   is” “then you may sit down”  king replied here  other guineapig cheered   suppressed “come  finished  guineapigs” thought alice “now we shall get  better” “i’d rather finish my tea” said  hatter   anxious look   queen who  reading  list  singers “you may go” said  king   hatter hurriedly left  court without even waiting  put his shoes on “—and just take his head off outside”  queen added  one   officers but  hatter  out  sight before  officer could get   door “call  next witness” said  king the next witness   duchess’s cook she carried  pepperbox  her hand  alice guessed who  was even before she got into  court   way  people near  door began sneezing all  once “give your evidence” said  king “shan’t” said  cook the king looked anxiously   white rabbit who said   low voice “your majesty must crossexamine this witness” “well if i must i must”  king said   melancholy air and after folding his arms  frowning   cook till his eyes  nearly out  sight  said   deep voice “what  tarts made of” “pepper mostly” said  cook “treacle” said  sleepy voice behind her “collar  dormouse”  queen shrieked out “behead  dormouse turn  dormouse out  court suppress him pinch him off  his whiskers” for some minutes  whole court   confusion getting  dormouse turned out and   time they had settled down again  cook had disappeared “never mind” said  king   air  great relief “call  next witness” and  added   undertone   queen “really my dear you must crossexamine  next witness it quite makes my forehead ache” alice watched  white rabbit   fumbled over  list feeling very curious  see what  next witness would  like “—for they haven’t got much evidence yet” she said  herself imagine her surprise when  white rabbit read out   top  his shrill little voice  name “alice” chapter xii alice’s evidence “here” cried alice quite forgetting   flurry   moment how large she had grown   last few minutes  she jumped up  such  hurry  she tipped over  jurybox   edge  her skirt upsetting all  jurymen    heads   crowd below  there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much   globe  goldfish she had accidentally upset  week before “oh i beg your pardon” she exclaimed   tone  great dismay  began picking them up again  quickly  she could   accident   goldfish kept running  her head  she had  vague sort  idea  they must  collected  once  put back into  jurybox or they would die “the trial cannot proceed” said  king   very grave voice “until all  jurymen  back  their proper places—all”  repeated  great emphasis looking hard  alice   said so alice looked   jurybox  saw that  her haste she had put  lizard  head downwards   poor little thing  waving  tail about   melancholy way being quite unable  move she soon got  out again  put  right “not   signifies much” she said  herself “i should think  would  quite  much use   trial one way up   other” as soon   jury had  little recovered   shock  being upset  their slates  pencils had been found  handed back  them they set  work very diligently  write out  history   accident all except  lizard who seemed too much overcome  do anything but sit   mouth open gazing up into  roof   court “what do you know about this business”  king said  alice “nothing” said alice “nothing whatever” persisted  king “nothing whatever” said alice “that’s very important”  king said turning   jury they  just beginning  write this down  their slates when  white rabbit interrupted “unimportant your majesty means  course”  said   very respectful tone but frowning  making faces  him   spoke “unimportant  course i meant”  king hastily said  went   himself   undertone “important—unimportant—unimportant—important—”  if   trying which word sounded best some   jury wrote  down “important”  some “unimportant” alice could see this  she  near enough  look over their slates “but  doesn’t matter  bit” she thought  herself at this moment  king who had been  some time busily writing  his notebook cackled out “silence”  read out  his book “rule fortytwo all persons more than  mile high  leave  court” everybody looked  alice “i’m not  mile high” said alice “you are” said  king “nearly two miles high” added  queen “well i shan’t go  any rate” said alice “besides that’s not  regular rule you invented  just now” “it’s  oldest rule   book” said  king “then  ought   number one” said alice the king turned pale  shut his notebook hastily “consider your verdict”  said   jury   low trembling voice “there’s more evidence  come yet please your majesty” said  white rabbit jumping up   great hurry “this paper  just been picked up” “what’s  it” said  queen “i haven’t opened  yet” said  white rabbit “but  seems    letter written   prisoner to—to somebody” “it must have been that” said  king “unless   written  nobody which isn’t usual you know” “who   directed to” said one   jurymen “it isn’t directed  all” said  white rabbit “in fact there’s nothing written   outside” he unfolded  paper   spoke  added “it isn’t  letter after all it’s  set  verses” “are they   prisoner’s handwriting” asked another   jurymen “no they’re not” said  white rabbit “and that’s  queerest thing about it” the jury all looked puzzled “he must have imitated somebody else’s hand” said  king the jury all brightened up again “please your majesty” said  knave “i didn’t write it  they can’t prove i did there’s no name signed   end” “if you didn’t sign it” said  king “that only makes  matter worse you must have meant some mischief or else you’d have signed your name like  honest man” there   general clapping  hands  this    first really clever thing  king had said  day “that proves his guilt” said  queen “it proves nothing   sort” said alice “why you don’t even know what they’re about” “read them” said  king the white rabbit put  his spectacles “where shall i begin please your majesty”  asked “begin   beginning”  king said gravely “and go  till you come   end then stop” these   verses  white rabbit read— “they told me you had been  her and mentioned me  him she gave me  good character but said i could not swim he sent them word i had not gone we know    true if she should push  matter on what would become  you i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned  him  you though they  mine before if i or she should chance   involved  this affair he trusts  you  set them free exactly  we were my notion   you had been before she had this fit an obstacle  came between him  ourselves  it don’t let him know she liked them best for this must ever  a secret kept  all  rest between yourself  me” “that’s  most important piece  evidence we’ve heard yet” said  king rubbing his hands “so now let  jury—” “if any one  them can explain it” said alice she had grown so large   last few minutes  she wasn’t  bit afraid  interrupting him “i’ll give him sixpence i don’t believe there’s  atom  meaning  it” the jury all wrote down  their slates “she doesn’t believe there’s  atom  meaning  it” but none  them attempted  explain  paper “if there’s no meaning  it” said  king “that saves  world  trouble you know  we needn’t try  find any and yet i don’t know”  went on spreading out  verses  his knee  looking  them  one eye “i seem  see some meaning  them after all “—said i could not swim—” you can’t swim can you”  added turning   knave the knave shook his head sadly “do i look like it”  said which  certainly did not being made entirely  cardboard “all right so far” said  king   went  muttering over  verses  himself “‘we know    true—’ that’s  jury  course—‘i gave her one they gave him two—’ why  must  what  did   tarts you know—” “but  goes  ‘they all returned  him  you’” said alice “why there they are” said  king triumphantly pointing   tarts   table “nothing can  clearer than that then again—‘before she had this fit—’ you never had fits my dear i think”  said   queen “never” said  queen furiously throwing  inkstand   lizard  she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing  his slate  one finger   found  made no mark but  now hastily began again using  ink   trickling down his face  long   lasted “then  words don’t fit you” said  king looking round  court   smile there   dead silence “it’s  pun”  king added   offended tone  everybody laughed “let  jury consider their verdict”  king said  about  twentieth time  day “no no” said  queen “sentence first—verdict afterwards” “stuff  nonsense” said alice loudly “the idea  having  sentence first” “hold your tongue” said  queen turning purple “i won’t” said alice “off  her head”  queen shouted   top  her voice nobody moved “who cares  you” said alice she had grown  her full size  this time “you’re nothing but  pack  cards” at this  whole pack rose up into  air  came flying down upon her she gave  little scream half  fright  half  anger  tried  beat them off  found herself lying   bank  her head   lap  her sister who  gently brushing away some dead leaves  had fluttered down   trees upon her face “wake up alice dear” said her sister “why what  long sleep you’ve had” “oh i’ve had such  curious dream” said alice  she told her sister  well  she could remember them all these strange adventures  hers  you have just been reading about  when she had finished her sister kissed her  said “it was  curious dream dear certainly but now run   your tea it’s getting late” so alice got up  ran off thinking while she ran  well she might what  wonderful dream  had been but her sister sat still just  she left her leaning her head  her hand watching  setting sun  thinking  little alice  all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after  fashion  this  her dream— first she dreamed  little alice herself  once again  tiny hands  clasped upon her knee   bright eager eyes  looking up into hers—she could hear  very tones  her voice  see  queer little toss  her head  keep back  wandering hair  would always get into her eyes—and still  she listened or seemed  listen  whole place around her became alive   strange creatures  her little sister’s dream the long grass rustled  her feet   white rabbit hurried by—the frightened mouse splashed his way through  neighbouring
