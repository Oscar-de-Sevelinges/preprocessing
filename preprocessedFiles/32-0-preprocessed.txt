unfortunately if i could have brought  me  material i so carefully prepared this would   very different story whole books full  notes carefully copied records firsthand descriptions   picturesthat’s  worst loss we had some bird’seyes   cities  parks  lot  lovely views  streets  buildings outside  in  some  those gorgeous gardens and most important  all   women themselves nobody  ever believe how they looked descriptions aren’t any good when  comes  women  i never  good  descriptions anyhow but it’s got   done somehow  rest   world needs  know about  country i haven’t said where    fear some selfappointed missionaries or traders or landgreedy expansionists  take  upon themselves  push in they  not  wanted i can tell them that   fare worse than we did if they do find it it began this way there  three  us classmates  friendsterry o nicholson we used  call him  old nick  good reason jeff margrave  i vandyck jennings we had known each other years  years   spite  our differences we had  good deal  common all  us  interested  science terry  rich enough  do   pleased his great aim  exploration he used  make all kinds   row because there  nothing left  explore now only patchwork  filling in  said he filled  well enoughhe had  lot  talentsgreat  mechanics  electricity had all kinds  boats  motorcars   one   best  our airmen we never could have done  thing  all without terry jeff margrave  born    poet  botanistor bothbut his folks persuaded him    doctor instead he   good one  his age but his real interest   what  loved  call “the wonders  science” as  me sociology’s my major you have  back  up   lot  other sciences  course i’m interested  them all terry  strong  factsgeography  meteorology  those jeff could beat him any time  biology  i didn’t care what   they talked about so long   connected  human life somehow there  few things  don’t we three had  chance  join  big scientific expedition they needed  doctor   gave jeff  excuse  dropping his just opening practice they needed terry’s experience his machine  his money    me i got  through terry’s influence the expedition  up among  thousand tributaries  enormous hinterland   great river up where  maps had   made savage dialects studied  all manner  strange flora  fauna expected but this story  not about  expedition that  only  merest starter  ours my interest  first roused  talk among our guides i’m quick  languages know  good many  pick them up readily what     really good interpreter we took  us i made out quite  few legends  folk myths  these scattered tribes and  we got farther  farther upstream   dark tangle  rivers lakes morasses  dense forests  here  there  unexpected long spur running out   big mountains beyond i noticed  more  more  these savages had  story about  strange  terrible woman land   high distance “up yonder” “over there” “way up”was all  direction they could offer but their legends all agreed   main pointthat there  this strange country where no men livedonly women  girl children none  them had ever seen it it  dangerous deadly they said  any man  go there but there  tales  long ago when some brave investigator had seen ita big country big houses plenty peopleall women had no one else gone yesa good manybut they never came back it  no place  menof  they seemed sure i told  boys about these stories  they laughed  them naturally i did myself i knew  stuff  savage dreams  made of but when we had reached our farthest point just  day before we all had  turn around  start  home again   best  expeditions must  time we three made  discovery the main encampment    spit  land running out into  main stream or what we thought   main stream it had  same muddy color we had been seeing  weeks past  same taste i happened  speak   river  our last guide  rather superior fellow  quick bright eyes he told me  there  another river“over there short river sweet water red  blue” i  interested  this  anxious  see if i had understood so i showed him  red  blue pencil i carried  asked again yes  pointed   river  then   southwestward “rivergood waterred  blue” terry  close   interested   fellow’s pointing “what does  say van” i told him terry blazed up  once “ask him how far  is” the man indicated  short journey i judged about two hours maybe three “let’s go” urged terry “just us three maybe we can really find something may  cinnabar  it” “may  indigo” jeff suggested  his lazy smile it  early yet we had just breakfasted  leaving word  we’d  back before night we got away quietly not wishing   thought too gullible if we failed  secretly hoping  have some nice little discovery all  ourselves it   long two hours nearer three i fancy  savage could have done  alone much quicker there   desperate tangle  wood  water   swampy patch we never should have found our way across alone but there  one  i could see terry  compass  notebook marking directions  trying  place landmarks we came after  while   sort  marshy lake very big so   circling forest looked quite low  dim across it our guide told us  boats could go  there  our campbut “long wayall day” this water  somewhat clearer than  we had left but we could not judge well   margin we skirted   another half hour or so  ground growing firmer  we advanced  presently we turned  corner   wooded promontory  saw  quite different countrya sudden view  mountains steep  bare “one  those long easterly spurs” terry said appraisingly “may  hundreds  miles   range they crop out like that” suddenly we left  lake  struck directly toward  cliffs we heard running water before we reached it   guide pointed proudly  his river it  short we could see where  poured down  narrow vertical cataract   opening   face   cliff it  sweet water the guide drank eagerly  so did we “that’s snow water” terry announced “must come  way back   hills” but   being red  blueit  greenish  tint the guide seemed not  all surprised he hunted about  little  showed us  quiet marginal pool where there  smears  red along  border yes   blue terry got out his magnifying glass  squatted down  investigate “chemicals  some sorti can’t tell   spot look  me like dyestuffs let’s get nearer”  urged “up there   fall” we scrambled along  steep banks  got close   pool  foamed  boiled beneath  falling water here we searched  border  found traces  color beyond dispute morejeff suddenly held up  unlookedfor trophy it  only  rag  long raveled fragment  cloth but    wellwoven fabric   pattern    clear scarlet   water had not faded no savage tribe  we had heard  made such fabrics the guide stood serenely   bank well pleased  our excitement “one day blueone day redone day green”  told us  pulled  his pouch another strip  brighthued cloth “come down”  said pointing   cataract “woman countryup there” then we  interested we had our rest  lunch right there  pumped  man  further information he could tell us only what  others hada land  womenno menbabies but all girls no place  mendangerous some had gone  seenone had come back i could see terry’s jaw set  that no place  men dangerous he looked  if  might shin up  waterfall   spot but  guide would not hear  going up even if there had been any possible method  scaling  sheer cliff  we had  get back  our party before night “they might stay if we told them” i suggested but terry stopped  his tracks “look here fellows”  said “this  our find let’s not tell those cocky old professors let’s go  home  ‘em  then come backjust ushave  little expedition  our own” we looked  him much impressed there  something attractive   bunch  unattached young men  finding  undiscovered country   strictly amazonian nature of course we didn’t believe  storybut yet “there  no such cloth made  any  these local tribes” i announced examining those rags  great care “somewhere up yonder they spin  weave  dyeas well  we do” “that would mean  considerable civilization van there couldn’t  such  placeand not known about” “oh well i don’t know what’s  old republic up   pyrenees somewhereandorra precious few people know anything about that  it’s been minding  own business   thousand years then there’s montenegrosplendid little stateyou could lose  dozen montenegroes up  down these great ranges” we discussed  hotly all  way back  camp we discussed   care  privacy   voyage home we discussed  after that still only among ourselves while terry  making his arrangements he  hot about it lucky  had so much moneywe might have had  beg  advertise  years  start  thing  then  would have been  matter  public amusementjust sport   papers but t o nicholson could fix up his big steam yacht load his speciallymade big motorboat aboard  tuck   “dissembled” biplane without any more notice than  snip   society column we had provisions  preventives  all manner  supplies his previous experience stood him  good stead there it   very complete little outfit we   leave  yacht   nearest safe port  go up  endless river  our motorboat just  three  us   pilot then drop  pilot when we got   last stopping place   previous party  hunt up  clear water stream ourselves the motorboat we  going  leave  anchor   wide shallow lake it had  special covering  fitted armor thin but strong shut up like  clamshell “those natives can’t get into it or hurt it or move it” terry explained proudly “we’ll start our flier   lake  leave  boat   base  come back to” “if we come back” i suggested cheerfully “‘fraid  ladies  eat you”  scoffed “we’re not so sure about those ladies you know” drawled jeff “there may   contingent  gentlemen  poisoned arrows or something” “you don’t need  go if you don’t want to” terry remarked drily “go you’ll have  get  injunction  stop me” both jeff  i  sure about that but we did have differences  opinion all  long way an ocean voyage   excellent time  discussion now we had no eavesdroppers we could loll  loaf  our deck chairs  talk  talkthere  nothing else  do our absolute lack  facts only made  field  discussion wider “we’ll leave papers  our consul where  yacht stays” terry planned “if we don’t come back insay  monththey can send  relief party after us” “a punitive expedition” i urged “if  ladies do eat us we must make reprisals” “they can locate  last stopping place easy enough  i’ve made  sort  chart   lake  cliff  waterfall” “yes but how  they get up” asked jeff “same way we do  course if three valuable american citizens  lost up there they  follow somehowto say nothing   glittering attractions   fair landlet’s call  ‘feminisia’”  broke off “you’re right terry once  story gets out  river  crawl  expeditions   airships rise like  swarm  mosquitoes” i laughed  i thought  it “we’ve made  great mistake not  let mr yellow press   this save us what headlines” “not much” said terry grimly “this  our party we’re going  find  place alone” “what  you going  do   when you do find itif you do” jeff asked mildly jeff   tender soul i think  thought  countryif there  onewas just blossoming  roses  babies  canaries  tidies  all  sort  thing and terry  his secret heart had visions   sort  sublimated summer resortjust girls  girls  girlsand    going  bewell terry  popular among women even when there  other men around  it’s not   wondered    had pleasant dreams  what might happen i could see   his eyes   lay there looking   long blue rollers slipping by  fingering  impressive mustache  his but i thoughtthenthat i could form  far clearer idea  what  before us than either  them “you’re all off boys” i insisted “if there  such  placeand there does seem some foundation  believing ityou’ll find it’s built   sort  matriarchal principle that’s all the men have  separate cult  their own less socially developed than  women  make them  annual visita sort  wedding call this   condition known  have existedhere’s just  survival they’ve got some peculiarly isolated valley or tableland up there  their primeval customs have survived that’s all there   it” “how about  boys” jeff asked “oh  men take them away  soon  they  five or six you see” “and how about this danger theory all our guides  so sure of” “danger enough terry  we’ll have   mighty careful women   stage  culture  quite able  defend themselves  have no welcome  unseasonable visitors” we talked  talked and  all my airs  sociological superiority i  no nearer than any  them it  funny though   light  what we did find those extremely clear ideas  ours   what  country  women would  like it  no use  tell ourselves  one another  all this  idle speculation we  idle  we did speculate   ocean voyage   river voyage too “admitting  improbability” we’d begin solemnly  then launch out again “they would fight among themselves” terry insisted “women always do we mustn’t look  find any sort  order  organization” “you’re dead wrong” jeff told him “it   like  nunnery under  abbessa peaceful harmonious sisterhood” i snorted derision  this idea “nuns indeed your peaceful sisterhoods  all celibate jeff  under vows  obedience these  just women  mothers  where there’s motherhood you don’t find sisterhoodnot much” “no sirthey’ll scrap” agreed terry “also we mustn’t look  inventions  progress it’ll  awfully primitive” “how about  cloth mill” jeff suggested “oh cloth women have always been spinsters but there they stopyou’ll see” we joked terry about his modest impression   would  warmly received but  held his ground “you’ll see”  insisted “i’ll get solid  them alland play one bunch against another i’ll get myself elected king  no timewhew solomon  have  take  back seat” “where do we come    deal” i demanded “aren’t we viziers or anything” “couldn’t risk it”  asserted solemnly “you might start  revolutionprobably would no you’ll have   beheaded or bowstrungor whatever  popular method  execution is” “you’d have  do  yourself remember” grinned jeff “no husky black slaves  mamelukes and there’d  two  us  only one  youeh van” jeff’s ideas  terry’s  so far apart  sometimes   all i could do  keep  peace between them jeff idealized women   best southern style he  full  chivalry  sentiment  all that and    good boy  lived up  his ideals you might say terry did too if you can call his views about women anything so polite  ideals i always liked terry he   man’s man very much so generous  brave  clever but i don’t think any  us  college days  quite pleased  have him  our sisters we weren’t very stringent heavens no but terry  “the limit” later onwhy  course  man’s life  his own we held  asked no questions but barring  possible exception  favor   not impossible wife or  his mother or  course  fair relatives  his friends terry’s idea seemed    pretty women  just so much game  homely ones not worth considering it  really unpleasant sometimes  see  notions  had but i got out  patience  jeff too he had such rosecolored halos  his womenfolks i held  middle ground highly scientific  course  used  argue learnedly about  physiological limitations   sex we  not   least “advanced”   woman question any  us then so we joked  disputed  speculated  after  interminable journey we got  our old camping place  last it  not hard  find  river just poking along  side till we came  it    navigable  far   lake when we reached   slid out   broad glistening bosom   high gray promontory running out toward us   straight white fall clearly visible  began   really exciting there  some talk even then  skirting  rock wall  seeking  possible footway up but  marshy jungle made  method look not only difficult but dangerous terry dismissed  plan sharply “nonsense fellows we’ve decided that it might take monthswe haven’t got  provisions no sirwe’ve got  take our chances if we get back safeall right if we don’t why we’re not  first explorers  get lost   shuffle there  plenty  come after us” so we got  big biplane together  loaded   our scientifically compressed baggage  camera  course  glasses  supply  concentrated food our pockets  magazines  small necessities  we had our guns  coursethere  no knowing what might happen up  up  up we sailed way up  first  get “the lay   land”  make note  it out   dark green sea  crowding forest this highstanding spur rose steeply it ran back  either side apparently   faroff whitecrowned peaks   distance themselves probably inaccessible “let’s make  first trip geographical” i suggested “spy out  land  drop back here  more gasoline with your tremendous speed we can reach  range  back all right then we can leave  sort  map  boardfor  relief expedition” “there’s sense  that” terry agreed “i’ll put off being king  ladyland  one more day” so we made  long skirting voyage turned  point   cape which  close by ran up one side   triangle  our best speed crossed over  base where  left  higher mountains  so back  our lake  moonlight “that’s not  bad little kingdom” we agreed when   roughly drawn  measured we could tell  size fairly  our speed and  what we could see   sidesand  icy ridge   back end“it’s  pretty enterprising savage who would manage  get into it” jeff said of course we had looked   land itselfeagerly but we  too high  going too fast  see much it appeared   well forested about  edges but   interior there  wide plains  everywhere parklike meadows  open places there  cities too  i insisted it lookedwell  looked like any other countrya civilized one i mean we had  sleep after  long sweep through  air but we turned out early enough next day  again we rose softly up  height till we could top  crowning trees  see  broad fair land  our pleasure “semitropical looks like  firstrate climate it’s wonderful what  little height  do  temperature” terry  studying  forest growth “little height is  what you call little” i asked our instruments measured  clearly we had not realized  long gentle rise   coast perhaps “mighty lucky piece  land i call it” terry pursued “now   folksi’ve had enough scenery” so we sailed low crossing back  forth quartering  country  we went  studying it we sawi can’t remember now how much  this we noted then  how much  supplemented  our later knowledge but we could not help seeing this much even   excited daya land   state  perfect cultivation where even  forests looked  if they  cared for  land  looked like  enormous park only   even more evidently  enormous garden “i don’t see any cattle” i suggested but terry  silent we  approaching  village i confess  we paid small attention   clean wellbuilt roads   attractive architecture   ordered beauty   little town we had our glasses out even terry setting his machine   spiral glide clapped  binoculars  his eyes they heard our whirring screw they ran out   housesthey gathered    fields swiftrunning light figures crowds  them we stared  stared until   almost too late  catch  levers sweep off  rise again  then we held our peace   long run upward “gosh” said terry after  while “only women thereand children” jeff urged excitedly “but they lookwhy this   civilized country” i protested “there must  men” “of course there  men” said terry “come on let’s find ‘em” he refused  listen  jeff’s suggestion  we examine  country further before we risked leaving our machine “there’s  fine landing place right there where we came over”  insisted     excellent onea wide flattopped rock overlooking  lake  quite out  sight   interior “they won’t find this   hurry”  asserted  we scrambled   utmost difficulty down  safer footing “come on boysthere  some good lookers   bunch” of course   unwise  us it  quite easy  see afterward  our best plan   have studied  country more fully before we left our swooping airship  trusted ourselves  mere foot service but we  three young men we had been talking about this country  over  year hardly believing  there  such  place  nowwe   it it looked safe  civilized enough  among those upturned crowding faces though some  terrified enough there  great beautyon  we all agreed “come on” cried terry pushing forward “oh come on here goes  herland” chapter  rash advances not more than ten or fifteen miles we judged   our landing rock   last village for all our eagerness we thought  wise  keep   woods  go carefully even terry’s ardor  held  check  his firm conviction  there  men   met  we saw    each  us had  good stock  cartridges “they may  scarce  they may  hidden away somewheresome kind   matriarchate  jeff tells us   matter they may live up   mountains yonder  keep  women  this part   countrysort   national harem but there  men somewheredidn’t you see  babies” we had all seen babies children big  little everywhere  we had come near enough  distinguish  people and though  dress we could not  sure  all  grown persons still there had not been one man  we  certain of “i always liked  arab saying ‘first tie your camel  then trust   lord’” jeff murmured so we all had our weapons  hand  stole cautiously through  forest terry studied   we progressed “talk  civilization”  cried softly  restrained enthusiasm “i never saw  forest so petted even  germany look there’s not  dead boughthe vines  trainedactually and see here”he stopped  looked about him calling jeff’s attention   kinds  trees they left me   landmark  made  limited excursion  either side “foodbearing practically all  them” they announced returning “the rest splendid hardwood call this  forest it’s  truck farm” “good thing  have  botanist  hand” i agreed “sure there  no medicinal ones or any  pure ornament” as  matter  fact they  quite right these towering trees  under  careful cultivation  so many cabbages in other conditions we should have found those woods full  fair foresters  fruit gatherers but  airship   conspicuous object   no means quietand women  cautious all we found moving  those woods  we started through them  birds some gorgeous some musical all so tame   seemed almost  contradict our theory  cultivationat least until we came upon occasional little glades where carved stone seats  tables stood   shade beside clear fountains  shallow bird baths always added “they don’t kill birds  apparently they do kill cats” terry declared “must  men here hark” we had heard something something not   least like  birdsong  very much like  suppressed whisper  laughtera little happy sound instantly smothered we stood like so many pointers  then used our glasses swiftly carefully “it couldn’t have been far off” said terry excitedly “how about this big tree” there   very large  beautiful tree   glade we had just entered  thick widespreading branches  sloped out  lapping fans like  beech or pine it  trimmed underneath some twenty feet up  stood there like  huge umbrella  circling seats beneath “look”  pursued “there  short stumps  branches left  climb on there’s someone up  tree i believe” we stole near cautiously “look out   poisoned arrow  your eye” i suggested but terry pressed forward sprang up   seatback  grasped  trunk “in my heart more likely”  answered “gee look boys” we rushed close   looked up there among  boughs overhead  somethingmore than one somethingthat clung motionless close   great trunk  first  then  one  all we started up  tree separated into three swiftmoving figures  fled upward as we climbed we could catch glimpses  them scattering above us by  time we had reached about  far  three men together dared push they had left  main trunk  moved outward each one balanced   long branch  dipped  swayed beneath  weight we paused uncertain if we pursued further  boughs would break under  double burden we might shake them off perhaps but none  us  so inclined in  soft dappled light  these high regions breathless  our rapid climb we rested awhile eagerly studying our objects  pursuit while they  turn  no more terror than  set  frolicsome children   game  tag sat  lightly  so many big bright birds  their precarious perches  frankly curiously stared  us “girls” whispered jeff under his breath  if they might fly if  spoke aloud “peaches” added terry scarcely louder “peacherinosapricotnectarines whew” they  girls  course no boys could ever have shown  sparkling beauty  yet none  us  certain  first we saw short hair hatless loose  shining  suit  some light firm stuff  closest  tunics  kneebreeches met  trim gaiters as bright  smooth  parrots   unaware  danger they swung there before us wholly  ease staring  we stared till first one  then all  them burst into peals  delighted laughter then there   torrent  soft talk tossed back  forth no savage singsong but clear musical fluent speech we met their laughter cordially  doffed our hats  them  which they laughed again delightedly then terry wholly  his element made  polite speech  explanatory gestures  proceeded  introduce us  pointing finger “mr jeff margrave”  said clearly jeff bowed  gracefully   man could   fork   great limb “mr vandyck jennings”i also tried  make  effective salute  nearly lost my balance then terry laid his hand upon his chesta fine chest  had too  introduced himself   braced carefully   occasion  achieved  excellent obeisance again they laughed delightedly   one nearest me followed his tactics “celis” she said distinctly pointing   one  blue “alima”the one  rose then   vivid imitation  terry’s impressive manner she laid  firm delicate hand  her goldgreen jerkin“ellador” this  pleasant but we got no nearer “we can’t sit here  learn  language” terry protested he beckoned  them  come nearer most winninglybut they gaily shook their heads he suggested  signs  we all go down together but again they shook their heads still merrily then ellador clearly indicated  we should go down pointing  each  all  us  unmistakable firmness  further seeming  imply   sweep   lithe arm  we not only go downward but go away altogetherat which we shook our heads  turn “have  use bait” grinned terry “i don’t know about you fellows but i came prepared” he produced   inner pocket  little box  purple velvet  opened   snapand out    drew  long sparkling thing  necklace  big varicolored stones  would have been worth  million if real ones he held  up swung it glittering   sun offered  first  one then  another holding  out  far   could reach toward  girl nearest him he stood braced   fork held firmly  one handthe other swinging his bright temptation reached far out along  bough but not quite  his full stretch she  visibly moved i noted hesitated spoke  her companions they chattered softly together one evidently warning her  other encouraging then softly  slowly she drew nearer this  alima  tall longlimbed lass wellknit  evidently both strong  agile her eyes  splendid wide fearless  free  suspicion   child’s who  never been rebuked her interest  more    intent boy playing  fascinating game than   girl lured   ornament the others moved  bit farther out holding firmly watching terry’s smile  irreproachable but i did not like  look  his eyesit  like  creature about  spring i could already see  happenthe dropped necklace  sudden clutching hand  girl’s sharp cry   seized her  drew her in but  didn’t happen she made  timid reach  her right hand   gay swinging thinghe held   little nearerthen swift  light she seized   him  her left  dropped   instant   bough below he made his snatch quite vainly almost losing his position  his hand clutched only air  then  inconceivable rapidity  three bright creatures  gone they dropped   ends   big boughs  those below fairly pouring themselves off  tree while we climbed downward  swiftly  we could we heard their vanishing gay laughter we saw them fleeting away   wide open reaches   forest  gave chase but we might  well have chased wild antelopes so we stopped  length somewhat breathless “no use” gasped terry “they got away  it my word the men  this country must  good sprinters” “inhabitants evidently arboreal” i grimly suggested “civilized  still arborealpeculiar people” “you shouldn’t have tried  way” jeff protested “they  perfectly friendly now we’ve scared them” but   no use grumbling  terry refused  admit any mistake “nonsense”  said “they expected it women like   run after come on let’s get   town maybe we’ll find them there let’s see    this direction  not far   woods  i remember” when we reached  edge   open country we reconnoitered  our field glasses there  was about four miles off  same town we concluded unless  jeff ventured they all had pink houses the broad green fields  closely cultivated gardens sloped away  our feet  long easy slant  good roads winding pleasantly here  there  narrower paths besides “look  that” cried jeff suddenly “there they go” sure enough close   town across  wide meadow three brighthued figures  running swiftly “how could they have got  far  this time it can’t   same ones” i urged but through  glasses we could identify our pretty treeclimbers quite plainly  least  costume terry watched them we all did   matter till they disappeared among  houses then  put down his glass  turned  us drawing  long breath “mother  mike boyswhat gorgeous girls to climb like that  run like that  afraid  nothing this country suits me all right let’s get ahead” “nothing venture nothing have” i suggested but terry preferred “faint heart ne’er won fair lady” we set forth   open walking briskly “if there  any men we’d better keep  eye out” i suggested but jeff seemed lost  heavenly dreams  terry  highly practical plans “what  perfect road what  heavenly country see  flowers  you” this  jeff always  enthusiast but we could agree  him fully the road  some sort  hard manufactured stuff sloped slightly  shed rain  every curve  grade  gutter  perfect  if   europe’s best “no men eh” sneered terry on either side  double row  trees shaded  footpaths between  trees bushes or vines all fruitbearing now  then seats  little wayside fountains everywhere flowers “we’d better import some  these ladies  set ‘em  parking  united states” i suggested “mighty nice place they’ve got here” we rested  few moments  one   fountains tested  fruit  looked ripe  went on impressed  all our gay bravado   sense  quiet potency which lay about us here  evidently  people highly skilled efficient caring  their country   florist cares  his costliest orchids under  soft brilliant blue   clear sky   pleasant shade  those endless rows  trees we walked unharmed  placid silence broken only   birds presently there lay before us   foot   long hill  town or village we  aiming for we stopped  studied it jeff drew  long breath “i wouldn’t have believed  collection  houses could look so lovely”  said “they’ve got architects  landscape gardeners  plenty that’s sure” agreed terry i  astonished myself you see i come  california  there’s no country lovelier but when  comes  towns i have often groaned  home  see  offensive mess man made   face  nature even though i’m no art sharp like jeff but this place it  built mostly   sort  dull rosecolored stone  here  there some clear white houses   lay abroad among  green groves  gardens like  broken rosary  pink coral “those big white ones  public buildings evidently” terry declared “this  no savage country my friend but no men boys  behooves us  go forward most politely” the place had  odd look more impressive  we approached “it’s like  exposition” “it’s too pretty   true” “plenty  palaces but where   homes” “oh there  little ones enoughbut” it certainly  different  any towns we had ever seen “there’s no dirt” said jeff suddenly “there’s no smoke”  added after  little “there’s no noise” i offered but terry snubbed me“that’s because they  laying low  us we’d better  careful how we go  there” nothing could induce him  stay out however so we walked on everything  beauty order perfect cleanness   pleasantest sense  home over  all as we neared  center   town  houses stood thicker ran together   were grew into rambling palaces grouped among parks  open squares something  college buildings stand  their quiet greens and then turning  corner we came into  broad paved space  saw before us  band  women standing close together  even order evidently waiting  us we stopped  moment  looked back the street behind  closed  another band marching steadily shoulder  shoulder we went onthere seemed no other way  goand presently found ourselves quite surrounded  this closemassed multitude women all  them but they  not young they  not old they  not   girl sense beautiful they  not   least ferocious and yet  i looked  face  face calm grave wise wholly unafraid evidently assured  determined i had  funniest feelinga very early feelinga feeling  i traced back  back  memory until i caught up    last it   sense  being hopelessly   wrong  i had so often felt  early youth when my short legs’ utmost effort failed  overcome  fact  i  late  school jeff felt  too i could see  did we felt like small boys very small boys caught doing mischief  some gracious lady’s house but terry showed no such consciousness i saw his quick eyes darting here  there estimating numbers measuring distances judging chances  escape he examined  close ranks about us reaching back far  every side  murmured softly  me “every one  ‘em over forty  i’m  sinner” yet they  not old women each    full bloom  rosy health erect serene standing surefooted  light  any pugilist they had no weapons  we had but we had no wish  shoot “i’d  soon shoot my aunts” muttered terry again “what do they want  us anyhow they seem  mean business” but  spite   businesslike aspect  determined  try his favorite tactics terry had come armed   theory he stepped forward  his brilliant ingratiating smile  made low obeisance   women before him then  produced another tribute  broad soft scarf  filmy texture rich  color  pattern  lovely thing even  my eye  offered    deep bow   tall unsmiling woman who seemed  head  ranks before him she took    gracious nod  acknowledgment  passed    those behind her he tried again this time bringing out  circlet  rhinestones  glittering crown  should have pleased any woman  earth he made  brief address including jeff  me  partners  his enterprise   another bow presented this again his gift  accepted and  before passed out  sight “if they  only younger”  muttered between his teeth “what  earth   fellow  say   regiment  old colonels like this” in all our discussions  speculations we had always unconsciously assumed   women whatever else they might be would  young most men do think  way i fancy “woman”   abstract  young and we assume charming as they get older they pass off  stage somehow into private ownership mostly or out   altogether but these good ladies  very much   stage  yet any one  them might have been  grandmother we looked  nervousnessthere  none for terror perhapsthere  none for uneasiness  curiosity  excitementand all we saw  what might have been  vigilance committee  women doctors  cool

“this won’t do” said terry  us quickly “we mustn’t let them get us  this boys all together now” we stopped  our tracks we began  explain  make signs pointing away toward  big forestindicating  we would go back  itat once it makes me laugh knowing all i do now  think  us three boysnothing else three audacious impertinent boysbutting into  unknown country without any sort   guard or defense we seemed  think  if there  men we could fight them  if there  only womenwhy they would  no obstacles  all jeff  his gentle romantic oldfashioned notions  women  clinging vines terry  his clear decided practical theories  there  two kinds  womenthose  wanted  those  didn’t desirable  undesirable  his demarcation the latter   large class but negligiblehe had never thought about them  all and now here they were  great numbers evidently indifferent  what  might think evidently determined  some purpose  their own regarding him  apparently well able  enforce their purpose we all thought hard just then it had not seemed wise  object  going  them even if we could have our one chance  friendlinessa civilized attitude  both sides but once inside  building there  no knowing what these determined ladies might do  us even  peaceful detention  not  our minds  when we named  imprisonment  looked even worse so we made  stand trying  make clear  we preferred  open country one  them came forward   sketch  our flier asking  signs if we   aerial visitors they had seen this we admitted they pointed   again    outlying country  different directionsbut we pretended we did not know where  was   truth we  not quite sure  gave  rather wild indication   whereabouts again they motioned us  advance standing so packed about  door  there remained but  one straight path open all around us  behind they  massed solidlythere  simply nothing  do but go forwardor fight we held  consultation “i never fought  women  my life” said terry greatly perturbed “but i’m not going  there i’m not going  beherded inas if we    cattle chute” “we can’t fight them  course” jeff urged “they’re all women  spite  their nondescript clothes nice women too good strong sensible faces i guess we’ll have  go in” “we may never get out if we do” i told them “strong  sensible yes but i’m not so sure about  good look  those faces” they had stood  ease waiting while we conferred together but never relaxing their close attention their attitude  not  rigid discipline  soldiers there  no sense  compulsion about them terry’s term   “vigilance committee”  highly descriptive they had just  aspect  sturdy burghers gathered hastily  meet some common need or peril all moved  precisely  same feelings   same end never anywhere before had i seen women  precisely this quality fishwives  market women might show similar strength but   coarse  heavy these  merely athleticlight  powerful college professors teachers writersmany women showed similar intelligence but often wore  strained nervous look while these   calm  cows  all their evident intellect we observed pretty closely just then  all  us felt     crucial moment the leader gave some word  command  beckoned us on   surrounding mass moved  step nearer “we’ve got  decide quick” said terry “i vote  go in” jeff urged but we  two  one against him   loyally stood  us we made one more effort   let go urgent but not imploring in vain “now   rush boys” terry said “and if we can’t break ‘em i’ll shoot   air” then we found ourselves much   position   suffragette trying  get   parliament buildings through  triple cordon  london police the solidity  those women  something amazing terry soon found    useless tore himself loose   moment pulled his revolver  fired upward as they caught  it  fired againwe heard  cry instantly each  us  seized  five women each holding arm or leg or head we  lifted like children straddling helpless children  borne onward wriggling indeed but most ineffectually we  borne inside struggling manfully but held secure most womanfully  spite  our best endeavors so carried  so held we came into  high inner hall gray  bare   brought before  majestic grayhaired woman who seemed  hold  judicial position there  some talk not much among them  then suddenly there fell upon each  us  once  firm hand holding  wetted cloth before mouth  nosean order  swimming sweetnessanesthesia chapter  a peculiar imprisonment from  slumber  deep  death  refreshing     healthy child i slowly awakened it  like rising up up up through  deep warm ocean nearer  nearer  full light  stirring air or like  return  consciousness after concussion   brain i  once thrown   horse while   visit   wild mountainous country quite new  me  i can clearly remember  mental experience  coming back  life through lifting veils  dream when i first dimly heard  voices  those about me  saw  shining snowpeaks   mighty range i assumed  this too would pass  i should presently find myself  my own home that  precisely  experience  this awakening receding waves  halfcaught swirling vision memories  home  steamer  boat  airship  forestat last all sinking away one after another till my eyes  wide open my brain clear  i realized what had happened the most prominent sensation   absolute physical comfort i  lying   perfect bed long broad smooth firmly soft  level   finest linen some warm light quilt  blanket   counterpane    joy   eye the sheet turned down some fifteen inches yet i could stretch my feet   foot   bed free but warmly covered i felt  light  clean   white feather it took me some time  conscientiously locate my arms  legs  feel  vivid sense  life radiate   wakening center   extremities a big room high  wide  many lofty windows whose closed blinds let through soft greenlit air  beautiful room  proportion  color  smooth simplicity  scent  blossoming gardens outside i lay perfectly still quite happy quite conscious  yet not actively realizing what had happened till i heard terry “gosh”  what  said i turned my head there  three beds  this chamber  plenty  room  them terry  sitting up looking about him alert  ever his remark though not loud roused jeff also we all sat up terry swung his legs out  bed stood up stretched himself mightily he    long nightrobe  sort  seamless garment undoubtedly comfortablewe all found ourselves so covered shoes  beside each bed also quite comfortable  goodlooking though  no means like our own we looked  our clothesthey  not there nor anything  all  varied contents  our pockets a door stood somewhat ajar  opened into  most attractive bathroom copiously provided  towels soap mirrors  all such convenient comforts  indeed our toothbrushes  combs our notebooks  thank goodness our watchesbut no clothes then we made  search   big room again  found  large airy closet holding plenty  clothing but not ours “a council  war” demanded terry “come  back  bedthe bed’s all right anyhow now then my scientific friend let us consider our case dispassionately” he meant me but jeff seemed most impressed “they haven’t hurt us   least”  said “they could have killed usoror anythingand i never felt better  my life” “that argues  they  all women” i suggested “and highly civilized you know you hit one   last scrimmagei heard her sing outand we kicked awfully” terry  grinning  us “so you realize what these ladies have done  us”  pleasantly inquired “they have taken away all our possessions all our clothesevery stitch we have been stripped  washed  put  bed like so many yearling babiesby these highly civilized women” jeff actually blushed he had  poetic imagination terry had imagination enough   different kind so had i also different i always flattered myself i had  scientific imagination which incidentally i considered  highest sort one   right   certain amount  egotism if founded  factand kept  one’s selfi think “no use kicking boys” i said “they’ve got us  apparently they’re perfectly harmless it remains  us  cook up some plan  escape like any other bottled heroes meanwhile we’ve got  put  these clotheshobson’s choice” the garments  simple   extreme  absolutely comfortable physically though  course we all felt like supes   theater there   onepiece cotton undergarment thin  soft  reached over  knees  shoulders something like  onepiece pajamas some fellows wear   kind  halfhose  came up  just under  knee  stayed therehad elastic tops  their own  covered  edges   first then there   thicker variety  union suit  lot  them   closet  varying weights  somewhat sturdier materialevidently they would do   pinch  nothing further then there  tunics kneelength  some long robes needless  say we took tunics we bathed  dressed quite cheerfully “not half bad” said terry surveying himself   long mirror his hair  somewhat longer than when we left  last barber   hats provided  much like those seen   prince   fairy tale lacking  plume the costume  similar   which we had seen  all  women though some  them those working   fields glimpsed  our glasses when we first flew over wore only  first two i settled my shoulders  stretched my arms remarking “they have worked out  mighty sensible dress i’ll say   them” with which we all agreed “now then” terry proclaimed “we’ve had  fine long sleepwe’ve had  good bathwe’re clothed   our right minds though feeling like  lot  neuters do you think these highly civilized ladies  going  give us any breakfast” “of course they will” jeff asserted confidently “if they had meant  kill us they would have done  before i believe we  going   treated  guests” “hailed  deliverers i think” said terry “studied  curiosities” i told them “but anyhow we want food so now   sortie” a sortie  not so easy the bathroom only opened into our chamber   had but one outlet  big heavy door which  fastened we listened “there’s someone outside” jeff suggested “let’s knock” so we knocked whereupon  door opened outside  another large room furnished   great table  one end long benches or couches against  wall some smaller tables  chairs all these  solid strong simple  structure  comfortable  usealso incidentally beautiful this room  occupied   number  women eighteen   exact some  whom we distinctly recalled terry heaved  disappointed sigh “the colonels” i heard him whisper  jeff jeff however advanced  bowed  his best manner so did we all  we  saluted civilly   tallstanding women we had no need  make pathetic pantomime  hunger  smaller tables  already laid  food  we  gravely invited   seated the tables  set  two each  us found ourselves placed visavis  one  our hosts  each table had five other stalwarts nearby unobtrusively watching we had plenty  time  get tired  those women the breakfast  not profuse but sufficient  amount  excellent  quality we  all too good travelers  object  novelty  this repast   new but delicious fruit  dish  large richflavored nuts   highly satisfactory little cakes  most agreeable there  water  drink   hot beverage   most pleasing quality some preparation like cocoa and then  there willynilly before we had satisfied our appetites our education began by each  our plates lay  little book  real printed book though different  ours both  paper  binding  well  course   type we examined them curiously “shades  sauveur” muttered terry “we’re  learn  language” we  indeed  learn  language  not only that but  teach our own there  blank books  parallel columns neatly ruled evidently prepared   occasion   these  fast  we learned  wrote down  name  anything we  urged  write our own name     side the book we had  study  evidently  schoolbook one  which children learned  read  we judged  this   their frequent consultation   methods  they had had no previous experience   art  teaching foreigners their language or  learning any other on  other hand what they lacked  experience they made up   genius such subtle understanding such instant recognition  our difficulties  readiness  meet them   constant surprise  us of course we  willing  meet them halfway it  wholly  our advantage   able  understand  speak  them    refusing  teach themwhy should we later  we did try open rebellion but only once that first meal  pleasant enough each  us quietly studying his companion jeff  sincere admiration terry   highly technical look  his    past masterlike  lion tamer  serpent charmer or some such professional i myself  intensely interested it  evident  those sets  five  there  check any outbreak  our part we had no weapons  if we did try  do any damage   chair say why five  one  too many  us even if they  women  we had found out  our sorrow it  not pleasant having them always around but we soon got used  it “it’s better than being physically restrained ourselves” jeff philosophically suggested when we  alone “they’ve given us  roomwith no great possibility  escapeand personal libertyheavily chaperoned it’s better than we’d have been likely  get   mancountry” “mancountry do you really believe there  no men here you innocent don’t you know there must be” demanded terry “yees” jeff agreed “of courseand yet” “and yetwhat come you obdurate sentimentalistwhat  you thinking about” “they may have some peculiar division  labor we’ve never heard of” i suggested “the men may live  separate towns or they may have subdued themsomehowand keep them shut up but there must  some” “that last suggestion  yours   nice one van” terry protested “same  they’ve got us subdued  shut up you make me shiver” “well figure  out  yourself anyway you please we saw plenty  kids  first day  we’ve seen those girls” “real girls” terry agreed  immense relief “glad you mentioned ‘em i declare if i thought there  nothing   country but those grenadiers i’d jump out  window” “speaking  windows” i suggested “let’s examine ours” we looked out  all  windows the blinds opened easily enough  there  no bars but  prospect  not reassuring this  not  pinkwalled town we had so rashly entered  day before our chamber  high up   projecting wing   sort  castle built out   steep spur  rock immediately below us  gardens fruitful  fragrant but their high walls followed  edge   cliff which dropped sheer down we could not see how far the distant sound  water suggested  river   foot we could look out east west  south to  southeastward stretched  open country lying bright  fair   morning light but  either side  evidently behind rose great mountains “this thing   regular fortressand no women built it i can tell you that” said terry we nodded agreeingly “it’s right up among  hillsthey must have brought us  long way” “we saw some kind  swiftmoving vehicles  first day” jeff reminded us “if they’ve got motors they are civilized” “civilized or not we’ve got our work cut out  us  get away  here i don’t propose  make  rope  bedclothes  try those walls till i’m sure there  no better way” we all concurred  this point  returned  our discussion    women jeff continued thoughtful “all  same there’s something funny about it”  urged “it isn’t just  we don’t see any menbut we don’t see any signs  them thethereaction  these women  different  any  i’ve ever met” “there  something  what you say jeff” i agreed “there   differentatmosphere” “they don’t seem  notice our being men”  went on “they treat uswelljust  they do one another it’s  if our being men   minor incident” i nodded i’d noticed  myself but terry broke  rudely “fiddlesticks”  said “it’s because  their advanced age they’re all grandmas i tell youor ought  be great aunts anyhow those girls  girls all right weren’t they” “yes” jeff agreed still slowly “but they weren’t afraidthey flew up  tree  hid like schoolboys caught out  boundsnot like shy girls” “and they ran like marathon winnersyou’ll admit that terry”  added terry  moody   days passed he seemed  mind our confinement more than jeff or i did   harped  alima  how near he’d come  catching her “if i had”  would say rather savagely “we’d have had  hostage  could have made terms” but jeff  getting  excellent terms  his tutor  even his guards  so  i it interested me profoundly  note  study  subtle difference between these women  other women  try  account  them in  matter  personal appearance there   great difference they all wore short hair some few inches  most some curly some not all light  clean  freshlooking “if their hair  only long” jeff would complain “they would look so much more feminine” i rather liked  myself after i got used  it why we should so admire “a woman’s crown  hair”  not admire  chinaman’s queue  hard  explain except  we  so convinced   long hair “belongs”   woman whereas  “mane”  horses   both   lions buffalos  such creatures only   male but i did miss itat first our time  quite pleasantly filled we  free   garden below our windows quite long   irregular rambling shape bordering  cliff the walls  perfectly smooth  high ending   masonry   building   i studied  great stones i became convinced   whole structure  extremely old it  built like  preincan architecture  peru  enormous monoliths fitted  closely  mosaics “these folks have  history that’s sure” i told  others “and some time they  fighterselse why  fortress” i said we  free   garden but not wholly alone  it there  always  string  those uncomfortably strong women sitting about always one  them watching us even if  others  reading playing games or busy  some kind  handiwork “when i see them knit” terry said “i can almost call them feminine” “that doesn’t prove anything” jeff promptly replied “scotch shepherds knitalways knitting” “when we get out” terry stretched himself  looked   far peaks “when we get out  this  get  where  real women arethe mothers   girls” “well what’ll we do then” i asked rather gloomily “how do you know we’ll ever get out” this   unpleasant idea which we unanimously considered returning  earnestness  our studies “if we  good boys  learn our lessons well” i suggested “if we  quiet  respectful  polite  they  not afraid  usthen perhaps they  let us out and anywaywhen we do escape    immense importance  we know  language” personally i  tremendously interested   language  seeing they had books  eager  get  them  dig into their history if they had one it  not hard  speak smooth  pleasant   ear  so easy  read  write  i marveled  it they had  absolutely phonetic system  whole thing   scientific  esparanto yet bore all  marks   old  rich civilization we  free  study  much  we wished   not left merely  wander   garden  recreation but introduced   great gymnasium partly   roof  partly   story below here we learned real respect  our tall guards no change  costume  needed  this work save  lay off outer clothing the first one   perfect  garment  exercise  need  devised absolutely free  move in and i had  admit much betterlooking than our usual one “fortyover fortysome  ‘em fifty i betand look  ‘em” grumbled terry  reluctant admiration there  no spectacular acrobatics such  only  young can perform but  allaround development they had  most excellent system a good deal  music went  it  posture dancing and sometimes gravely beautiful processional performances jeff  much impressed  it we did not know then how small  part  their physical culture methods this really was but found  agreeable  watch   take part in oh yes we took part all right it wasn’t absolutely compulsory but we thought  better  please terry   strongest  us though i  wiry  had good staying power  jeff   great sprinter  hurdler but i can tell you those old ladies gave us cards  spades they ran like deer  which i mean  they ran not  if    performance but  if   their natural gait we remembered those fleeting girls  our first bright adventure  concluded   was they leaped like deer too   quick folding motion   legs drawn up  turned  one side   sidelong twist   body i remembered  sprawling spreadeagle way  which some   fellows used  come over  lineand tried  learn  trick we did not easily catch up  these experts however “never thought i’d live   bossed   lot  elderly lady acrobats” terry protested they had games too  good many  them but we found them rather uninteresting  first it  like two people playing solitaire  see who would get  first more like  race or aa competitive examination than  real game  some fight  it i philosophized  bit over this  told terry  argued against their having any men about “there isn’t  mansize game   lot” i said “but they  interestingi like them” jeff objected “and i’m sure they  educational” “i’m sick  tired  being educated” terry protested “fancy going   dame schoolat our age i want  get out” but we could not get out  we  being educated swiftly our special tutors rose rapidly  our esteem they seemed  rather finer quality than  guards though all   terms  easy friendliness mine  named somel jeff’s zava  terry’s moadine we tried  generalize   names those   guards   our three girls but got nowhere “they sound well enough  they’re mostly short but there’s no similarity  terminationand no two alike however our acquaintance  limited  yet” there  many things we meant  askas soon  we could talk well enough better teaching i never saw from morning  night there  somel always  call except between two  four always pleasant   steady friendly kindness  i grew  enjoy very much jeff said miss zavahe would put   title though they apparently had nonewas  darling  she reminded him  his aunt esther  home but terry refused   won  rather jeered  his own companion when we  alone “i’m sick  it”  protested “sick   whole thing here we  cooped up  helpless   bunch  threeyearold orphans  being taught what they think  necessarywhether we like  or not confound their oldmaid impudence” nevertheless we  taught they brought   raised map  their country beautifully made  increased our knowledge  geographical terms but when we inquired  information    country outside they smilingly shook their heads they brought pictures not only  engravings   books but colored studies  plants  trees  flowers  birds they brought tools  various small objectswe had plenty  “material”  our school if  had not been  terry we would have been much more contented but   weeks ran into months  grew more  more irritable “don’t act like  bear   sore head” i begged him “we’re getting  finely every day we can understand them better  pretty soon we can make  reasonable plea   let out” “let out”  stormed “let outlike children kept after school i want  get out  i’m going to i want  find  men  this place  fightor  girls” “guess it’s  girls you’re most interested in” jeff commented “what  you going  fight withyour fists” “yesor sticks  stonesi’d just like to” and terry squared off  tapped jeff softly   jaw “just  instance”  said “anyhow”  went on “we could get back  our machine  clear out” “if it’s there” i cautiously suggested “oh don’t croak van if  isn’t there we’ll find our way down somehowthe boat’s there i guess” it  hard  terry so hard   finally persuaded us  consider  plan  escape it  difficult   highly dangerous but  declared  he’d go alone if we wouldn’t go  him   course we couldn’t think  that it appeared  had made  pretty careful study   environment from our end window  faced  point   promontory we could get  fair idea   stretch  wall   drop below also   roof we could make out more  even  one place glimpse  sort  path below  wall “it’s  question  three things”  said “ropes agility  not being seen” “that’s  hardest part” i urged still hoping  dissuade him “one or another pair  eyes   us every minute except  night” “therefore we must do   night”  answered “that’s easy” “we’ve got  think  if they catch us we may not  so well treated afterward” said jeff “that’s  business risk we must take i’m goingif i break my neck” there  no changing him the rope problem  not easy something strong enough  hold  man  long enough  let us down into  garden  then down over  wall there  plenty  strong ropes   gymnasiumthey seemed  love  swing  climb  thembut we  never there  ourselves we should have  piece  out  our bedding rugs  garments  moreover we should have  do  after we  shut    night  every day  place  cleaned  perfection  two  our guardians we had no shears no knives but terry  resourceful “these jennies have glass  china you see we’ll break  glass   bathroom  use that ‘love  find out  way’”  hummed “when we’re all out   window we’ll stand threeman high  cut  rope  far up  we can reach so   have more   wall i know just where i saw  bit  path below  there’s  big tree there too or  vine or somethingi saw  leaves” it seemed  crazy risk  take but this was   way terry’s expedition  we  all tired  our imprisonment so we waited  full moon retired early  spent  anxious hour or two   unskilled manufacture  manstrong ropes to retire into  depths   closet muffle  glass  thick cloth  break  without noise  not difficult  broken glass  cut though not  deftly   pair  scissors the broad moonlight streamed  through four  our windowswe had not dared leave our lights  too longand we worked hard  fast  our task  destruction hangings rugs robes towels  well  bedfurnitureeven  mattress coverswe left not one stitch upon another  jeff put it then   end window  less liable  observation we fastened one end  our cable strongly   firmset hinge   inner blind  dropped our coiled bundle  rope softly over “this part’s easy enoughi’ll come last so   cut  rope” said terry so i slipped down first  stood well braced against  wall then jeff  my shoulders then terry who shook us  little   sawed through  cord above his head then i slowly dropped   ground jeff following   last we all three stood safe   garden  most  our rope  us “goodbye grandma” whispered terry under his breath  we crept softly toward  wall taking advantage   shadow  every bush  tree he had been foresighted enough  mark  very spot only  scratch  stone  stone but we could see  read   light for anchorage there   tough fairsized shrub close   wall “now i’ll climb up  you two again  go over first” said terry “that’ll hold  rope firm till you both get up  top then i’ll go down   end if i can get off safely you can see me  followor say i’ll twitch  three times if i find there’s absolutely no footingwhy i’ll climb up again that’s all i don’t think they’ll kill us” from  top  reconnoitered carefully waved his hand  whispered “ok” then slipped over jeff climbed up  i followed  we rather shivered  see how far down  swaying wavering figure dropped hand under hand till  disappeared   mass  foliage far below then there  three quick pulls  jeff  i not without  joyous sense  recovered freedom successfully followed our leader chapter  our venture we  standing   narrow irregular all too slanting little ledge  should doubtless have ignominiously slipped off  broken our rash necks but   vine this   thickleaved widespreading thing  little like amphelopsis “it’s not quite vertical here you see” said terry full  pride  enthusiasm “this thing never would hold our direct weight but i think if we sort  slide down  it one   time sticking   hands  feet we’ll reach  next ledge alive” “as we do not wish  get up our rope againand can’t comfortably stay herei approve” said jeff solemnly terry slid down firstsaid he’d show us how  christian meets his death luck   us we had put   thickest  those intermediate suits leaving our tunics behind  made this scramble quite successfully though i got  pretty heavy fall just   end   only kept   second ledge  main force the next stage  down  sort  “chimney”a long irregular fissure  so  scratches many  painful  bruises not  few we finally reached  stream it  darker there but we felt  highly necessary  put  much distance  possible behind us so we waded jumped  clambered down  rocky riverbed   flickering black  white moonlight  leaf shadow till growing daylight forced  halt we found  friendly nuttree those large satisfying softshelled nuts we already knew so well  filled our pockets i see  i have not remarked  these women had pockets  surprising number  variety they   all their garments   middle one  particular  shingled  them so we stocked up  nuts till we bulged like prussian privates  marching order drank all we could hold  retired   day it  not  very comfortable place not  all easy  get at just  sort  crevice high up along  steep bank but   well veiled  foliage  dry after our exhaustive three or fourhour scramble   good breakfast food we all lay down along  crackheads  tails   wereand slept till  afternoon sun almost toasted our faces terry poked  tentative foot against my head “how  you van alive yet” “very much so” i told him and jeff  equally cheerful we had room  stretch if not  turn around but we could very carefully roll over one   time behind  sheltering foliage it  no use  leave there  daylight we could not see much   country but enough  know  we  now   beginning   cultivated area  no doubt there would   alarm sent out far  wide terry chuckled softly  himself lying there   hot narrow little rim  rock he dilated   discomfiture  our guards  tutors making many discourteous remarks i reminded him  we had still  long way  go before getting   place where we’d left our machine  no probability  finding  there but  only kicked me mildly   croaker “if you can’t boost don’t knock”  protested “i never said ‘twould   picnic but i’d run away   antarctic ice fields rather than   prisoner” we soon dozed off again the long rest  penetrating dry heat  good  us   night we covered  considerable distance keeping always   rough forested belt  land which we knew bordered  whole country sometimes we  near  outer edge  caught sudden glimpses   tremendous depths beyond “this piece  geography stands up like  basalt column” jeff said “nice time we’ll have getting down if they have confiscated our machine” for which suggestion  received summary chastisement what we could see inland  peaceable enough but only moonlit glimpses  daylight we lay very close as terry said we did not wish  kill  old ladieseven if we could  short   they  perfectly competent  pick us up bodily  carry us back if discovered there  nothing   but  lie low  sneak out unseen if we could do it there wasn’t much talking done at night we had our marathonobstacle race we “stayed not  brake  we stopped not  stone”  swam whatever water  too deep  wade  could not  got around but   only necessary twice by day sleep sound  sweet mighty lucky    we could live off  country  we did even  margin  forest seemed rich  foodstuffs but jeff thoughtfully suggested   very thing showed how careful we should have  be  we might run into some stalwart group  gardeners or foresters or nutgatherers  any minute careful we were feeling pretty sure  if we did not make good this time we  not likely  have another opportunity   last we reached  point  which we could see far below  broad stretch   still lake  which we had made our ascent “that looks pretty good  me” said terry gazing down  it “now if we can’t find  ‘plane we know where  aim if we have  drop over this wall some other way” the wall   point  singularly uninviting it rose so straight  we had  put our heads over  see  base   country below seemed    faroff marshy tangle  rank vegetation we did not have  risk our necks   extent however   last stealing along among  rocks  trees like so many creeping savages we came   flat space where we had landed  there  unbelievable good fortune we found our machine “covered too  jingo would you think they had  much sense” cried terry “if they had  much they’re likely  have more” i warned him softly “bet you  thing’s watched” we reconnoitered  widely  we could   failing moonlightmoons    painfully unreliable nature but  growing dawn showed us  familiar shape shrouded  some heavy cloth like canvas  no slightest sign  any watchman near we decided  make  quick dash  soon   light  strong enough  accurate work “i don’t care if  old thing’ll go or not” terry declared “we can run her   edge get aboard  just plane downplopbeside our boat there look theresee  boat” sure enoughthere  our motor lying like  gray cocoon   flat pale sheet  water quietly but swiftly we rushed forward  began  tug   fastenings   cover “confound  thing” terry cried  desperate impatience “they’ve got  sewed up   bag and we’ve not  knife among us” then  we tugged  pulled   tough cloth we heard  sound  made terry lift his head like  war horsethe sound   unmistakable giggle yesthree giggles there they werecelis alima elladorlooking just  they had when we first saw them standing  little way off  us  interested  mischievous  three schoolboys “hold on terryhold on” i warned “that’s too easy look out   trap” “let us appeal  their kind hearts” jeff urged “i think they  help us perhaps they’ve got knives” “it’s no use rushing them anyhow” i  absolutely holding   terry “we know they can outrun  outclimb us” he reluctantly admitted this  after  brief parley among ourselves we all advanced slowly toward them holding out our hands  token  friendliness they stood their ground till we had come fairly near  then indicated  we should stop to make sure we advanced  step or two  they promptly  swiftly withdrew so we stopped   distance specified then we used their language  far  we  able  explain our plight telling how we  imprisoned how we had escapeda good deal  pantomime here  vivid interest  their parthow we had traveled  night  hidden  day living  nutsand here terry pretended great hunger i know  could not have been hungry we had found plenty  eat  had not been sparing  helping ourselves but they seemed somewhat impressed  after  murmured consultation they produced  their pockets certain little packages    utmost ease  accuracy tossed them into our hands jeff  most appreciative  this  terry made extravagant gestures  admiration which seemed  set them off boyfashion  show their skill while we ate  excellent biscuits they had thrown us  while ellador kept  watchful eye  our movements celis ran off  some distance  set up  sort  “duckonarock” arrangement  big yellow nut  top  three balanced sticks alima meanwhile gathering stones they urged us  throw  it  we did but  thing   long way off    only after  number  failures  which those elvish damsels laughed delightedly  jeff succeeded  bringing  whole structure   ground it took me still longer  terry  his intense annoyance came third then celis set up  little tripod again  looked back  us knocking  down pointing  it  shaking her short curls severely “no” she said “badwrong” we  quite able  follow her then she set  up once more put  fat nut  top  returned   others  there those aggravating girls sat  took turns throwing little stones   thing while one stayed    setterup  they just popped  nut off two times out  three without upsetting  sticks pleased  punch they were too  we pretended  be but weren’t we got very friendly over this game but i told terry we’d  sorry if we didn’t get off while we could  then we begged  knives it  easy  show what we wanted  do  they each proudly produced  sort  strong claspknife  their pockets “yes” we said eagerly “that’s it please” we had learned quite  bit  their language you see and we just begged  those knives but they would not give them  us if we came  step too near they backed off standing light  eager  flight “it’s no sort  use” i said “come onlet’s get  sharp stone or somethingwe must get this thing off” so we hunted about  found what edged fragments we could  hacked away but   like trying  cut sailcloth   clamshell terry hacked  dug but said  us under his breath “boys we’re  pretty good conditionlet’s make  life  death dash  get hold  those girlswe’ve got to” they had drawn rather nearer  watch our efforts  we did take them rather  surprise also  terry said our recent training had strengthened us  wind  limb    few desperate moments those girls  scared  we almost triumphant but just  we stretched out our hands  distance between us widened they had got their pace apparently  then though we ran  our utmost speed  much farther than i thought wise they kept just out  reach all  time we stopped breathless  last  my repeated admonitions “this  stark foolishness” i urged “they  doing   purposecome back or you’ll  sorry” we went back much slower than we came   truth we  sorry as we reached our swaddled machine  sought again  tear loose  covering there rose up  all around  sturdy forms  quiet determined faces we knew so well “oh lord” groaned terry “the colonels it’s all upthey’re forty  one” it  no use  fight these women evidently relied  numbers not so much   drilled force but   multitude actuated   common impulse they showed no sign  fear  since we had no weapons whatever  there   least  hundred  them standing ten deep about us we gave   gracefully  we might of course we looked  punishmenta closer imprisonment solitary confinement maybebut nothing   kind happened they treated us  truants only   if they quite understood our truancy back we went not under  anesthetic this time but skimming along  electric motors enough like ours   quite recognizable each  us   separate vehicle  one ablebodied lady  either side  three facing him they  all pleasant enough  talked  us  much   possible  our limited powers and though terry  keenly mortified   first we all rather dreaded harsh treatment i  one soon began  feel  sort  pleasant confidence   enjoy  trip here  my five familiar companions all goodnatured  could be seeming  have no worse feeling than  mild triumph   winning some simple game  even  they politely suppressed this   good opportunity  see  country too   more i saw  it  better i liked it we went too swiftly  close observation but i could appreciate perfect roads  dustless   swept floor  shade  endless lines  trees  ribbon  flowers  unrolled beneath them   rich comfortable country  stretched off  away full  varied charm we rolled through many villages  towns  i soon saw   parklike beauty  our firstseen city  no exception our swift highsweeping view   ‘plane had been most attractive but lacked detail    first day  struggle  capture we noticed little but now we  swept along   easy rate  some thirty miles  hour  covered quite  good deal  ground we stopped  lunch  quite  sizable town  here rolling slowly through  streets we saw more   population they had come out  look  us everywhere we had passed but here  more  when we went   eat   big garden place  little shaded tables among  trees  flowers many eyes  upon us and everywhere open country village or cityonly women old women  young women   great majority who seemed neither young nor old but just women young girls also though these   children seeming    groups  themselves generally  less  evidence we caught many glimpses  girls  children  what seemed   schools or  playgrounds  so far  we could judge there  no boys we all looked carefully everyone gazed  us politely kindly   eager interest no one  impertinent we could catch quite  bit   talk now  all they said seemed pleasant enough wellbefore nightfall we  all safely back  our big room the damage we had done  quite ignored  beds  smooth  comfortable  before new clothing  towels supplied the only thing those women did   illuminate  gardens  night   set  extra watch but they called us  account next day our three tutors who had not joined   recapturing expedition had been quite busy  preparing  us  now made explanation they knew well we would make  our machine  also  there  no other way  getting downalive so our flight had troubled no one all they did   call  inhabitants  keep  eye  our movements all along  edge   forest between  two points it appeared  many  those nights we had been seen  careful ladies sitting snugly  big trees   riverbed or up among  rocks terry looked immensely disgusted but  struck me  extremely funny here we had been risking our lives hiding  prowling like outlaws living  nuts  fruit getting wet  cold  night  dry  hot  day  all  while these estimable women had just been waiting  us  come out now they began  explain carefully using such words  we could understand it appeared  we  considered  guests   countrysort  public wards our first violence had made  necessary  keep us safeguarded   while but  soon  we learned  languageand would agree  do no harmthey would show us all about  land jeff  eager  reassure them of course  did not tell  terry but  made  clear    ashamed  himself    would now conform as   languagewe all fell upon   redoubled energy they brought us books  greater numbers  i began  study them seriously “pretty punk literature” terry burst forth one day when we    privacy  our own room “of course one expects  begin  childstories but i would like something more interesting now” “can’t expect stirring romance  wild adventure without men can you” i asked nothing irritated terry more than  have us assume  there  no men but there  no signs  them   books they gave us or  pictures “shut up”  growled “what infernal nonsense you talk i’m going  ask ‘em outrightwe know enough now” in truth we had been using our best efforts  master  language   able  read fluently   discuss what we read  considerable ease that afternoon we  all sitting together   roofwe three   tutors gathered about  table no guards about we had been made  understand some time earlier  if we would agree  do no violence they would withdraw their constant attendance  we promised most willingly so there we sat  ease all  similar dress our hair  now  long  theirs only our beards  distinguish us we did not want those beards but had so far been unable  induce them  give us any cutting instruments “ladies” terry began out   clear sky   were “are there no men  this country” “men” somel answered “like you” “yes men” terry indicated his beard  threw back his broad shoulders “men real men” “no” she answered quietly “there  no men  this country there  not been  man among us  two thousand years” her look  clear  truthful  she did not advance this astonishing statement  if   astonishing but quite   matter  fact “butthe peoplethe children”  protested not believing her   least but not wishing  say so “oh yes” she smiled “i do not wonder you  puzzled we  mothersall  usbut there  no fathers we thought you would ask about  long agowhy have you not” her look   frankly kind  always her tone quite simple terry explained  we had not felt sufficiently used   language making rather  mess  it i thought but jeff  franker “will you excuse us all”  said “if we admit  we find  hard  believe there  no suchpossibilityin  rest   world” “have you no kind  life where   possible” asked zava “why yessome low forms  course” “how lowor how high rather” “wellthere  some rather high forms  insect life  which  occurs parthenogenesis we call itthat means virgin birth” she could not follow him “birth we know  course but what  virgin” terry looked uncomfortable but jeff met  question quite calmly “among mating animals  term virgin  applied   female who  not mated”  answered “oh i see and does  apply   male also or  there  different term  him” he passed this over rather hurriedly saying   same term would apply but  seldom used “no” she said “but one cannot mate without  other surely is not each thenvirginbefore mating and tell me have you any forms  life  which there  birth   father only” “i know  none”  answered  i inquired seriously “you ask us  believe   two thousand years there have been only women here  only girl babies born” “exactly” answered somel nodding gravely “of course we know  among other animals   not so  there  fathers  well  mothers  we see  you  fathers  you come   people who   both kinds we have been waiting you see  you   able  speak freely  us  teach us about your country   rest   world you know so much you see  we know only our own land” in  course  our previous studies we had been  some pains  tell them about  big world outside  draw sketches maps  make  globe even out   spherical fruit  show  size  relation   countries   tell   numbers  their people all this had been scant   outline but they quite understood i find i succeed very poorly  conveying  impression i would like   these women so far  being ignorant they  deeply wisethat we realized more  more   clear reasoning  real brain scope  power they  a no  but there   lot  things they did not know they had  evenest tempers  most perfect patience  good natureone   things most impressive about them all   absence  irritability so far we had only this group  study but afterward i found   common trait we had gradually come  feel  we    hands  friends  very capable ones  thatbut we couldn’t form any opinion yet   general level  these women “we want you  teach us all you can” somel went on her firm shapely hands clasped   table before her her clear quiet eyes meeting ours frankly “and we want  teach you what we have   novel  useful you can well imagine     wonderful event  us  have men among usafter two thousand years and we want  know about your women” what she said about our importance gave instant pleasure  terry i could see   way  lifted his head   pleased him but when she spoke  our womensomeway i had  queer little indescribable feeling not like any feeling i ever had before when “women”  mentioned “will you tell us how  came about” jeff pursued “you said ‘for two thousand years’did you have men here before that” “yes” answered zava they  all quiet   little “you should have our full history  readdo not  alarmedit  been made clear  short it took us  long time  learn how  write history oh how i should love  read yours” she turned  flashing eager eyes looking  one   other  us “it would  so wonderfulwould  not to compare  history  two thousand years  see what  differences arebetween us who  only mothers  you who  mothers  fathers too of course we see  our birds   father   useful   mother almost but among insects we find him  less importance sometimes very little is  not so  you” “oh yes birds  bugs” terry said “but not among animalshave you no animals” “we have cats” she said “the father  not very useful” “have you no cattlesheephorses” i drew some rough outlines  these beasts  showed them  her “we had   very old days these” said somel  sketched  swift sure touches  sort  sheep or llama “and these”dogs  two or three kinds “that that”pointing  my absurd but recognizable horse “what became  them” asked jeff “we do not want them anymore they took up too much roomwe need all our land  feed our people it  such  little country you know” “whatever do you do without milk” terry demanded incredulously “milk we have milk  abundanceour own” “butbuti mean  cookingfor grown people” terry blundered while they looked amazed   shade displeased jeff came   rescue “we keep cattle  their milk  well   their meat”  explained “cow’s milk   staple article  diet there   great milk industryto collect  distribute it” still they looked puzzled i pointed  my outline   cow “the farmer milks  cow” i said  sketched  milk pail  stool   pantomime showed  man milking “then   carried   city  distributed  milkmeneverybody     door   morning” “has  cow no child” asked somel earnestly “oh yes  course  calf  is” “is there milk   calf  you too” it took some time  make clear  those three sweetfaced women  process which robs  cow  her calf   calf   true food   talk led us into  further discussion   meat business they heard  out looking very white  presently begged   excused chapter  a unique history it  no use  me  try  piece out this account  adventures if  people who read   not interested  these amazing women  their history they  not  interested  all as  usthree young men   whole landful  womenwhat could we do we did get away  described   peacefully brought back again without  terry complained even  satisfaction  hitting anybody there  no adventures because there  nothing  fight there  no wild beasts   country  very few tame ones of these i might  well stop  describe  one common pet   country cats  course but such cats what do you suppose these lady burbanks had done  their cats by  most prolonged  careful selection  exclusion they had developed  race  cats  did not sing that’s  fact the most those poor dumb brutes could do   make  kind  squeak when they  hungry or wanted  door open and  course  purr  make  various mothernoises  their kittens moreover they had ceased  kill birds they  rigorously bred  destroy mice  moles  all such enemies   food supply but  birds  numerous  safe while we  discussing birds terry asked them if they used feathers  their hats  they seemed amused   idea he made  few sketches  our women’s hats  plumes  quills  those various tickling things  stick out so far  they  eagerly interested   everything about our women as  them they said they only wore hats  shade when working   sun  those  big light straw hats something like those used  china  japan in cold weather they wore caps or hoods “but  decorative purposesdon’t you think they would  becoming” pursued terry making  pretty  picture   could   lady   plumed hat they  no means agreed  that asking quite simply if  men wore  same kind we hastened  assure her  they did notdrew  them our kind  headgear “and do no men wear feathers  their hats” “only indians” jeff explained “savages you know” and  sketched  war bonnet  show them “and soldiers” i added drawing  military hat  plumes they never expressed horror or disapproval nor indeed much surprisejust  keen interest and  notes they mademiles  them but  return  our pussycats we   good deal impressed  this achievement  breeding  when they questioned usi can tell you we  well pumped  informationwe told  what had been done  dogs  horses  cattle but  there  no effort applied  cats except  show purposes i wish i could represent  kind quiet steady ingenious way they questioned us it  not just curiositythey weren’t  bit more curious about us than we  about them if  much but they  bent  understanding our kind  civilization  their lines  interrogation would gradually surround us  drive us  till we found ourselves up against some admissions we did not want  make “are all these breeds  dogs you have made useful” they asked “ohuseful why  hunting dogs  watchdogs  sheepdogs  usefuland sleddogs  courseand ratters i suppose but we don’t keep dogs  their usefulness the dog  ‘the friend  man’ we saywe love them” that they understood “we love our cats  way they surely  our friends  helpers too you can see how intelligent  affectionate they are” it   fact i’d never seen such cats except   few rare instances big handsome silky things friendly  everyone  devotedly attached  their special owners “you must have  heartbreaking time drowning kittens” we suggested but they said “oh no you see we care  them  you do  your valuable cattle the fathers  few compared   mothers just  few very fine ones  each town they live quite happily  walled gardens   houses  their friends but they only have  mating season once  year” “rather hard  thomas isn’t it” suggested terry “oh notruly you see   many centuries  we have been breeding  kind  cats we wanted they  healthy  happy  friendly  you see how do you manage  your dogs do you keep them  pairs or segregate  fathers or what” then we explained thatwell   wasn’t  question  fathers exactly  nobody wanted aa mother dog that well  practically all our dogs  malesthere  only  very small percentage  females allowed  live then zava observing terry  her grave sweet smile quoted back  him “rather hard  thomas isn’t it do they enjoy itliving without mates are your dogs  uniformly healthy  sweettempered  our cats” jeff laughed eyeing terry mischievously as  matter  fact we began  feel jeff something   traitorhe so often flopped over  took their side  things also his medical knowledge gave him  different point  view somehow “i’m sorry  admit”  told them “that  dog  us   most diseased  any animalnext  man and   temperthere  always some dogs who bite peopleespecially children” that  pure malice you see children  thethe raison d’etre  this country all our interlocutors sat up straight  once they  still gentle still restrained but there   note  deep amazement  their voices “do we understand  you keep  animalan unmated male animalthat bites children about how many  there  them please” “thousandsin  large city” said jeff “and nearly every family  one   country” terry broke   this “you must not imagine they  all dangerousit’s not one   hundred  ever bites anybody why they   best friends   childrena boy doesn’t have half  chance  hasn’t  dog  play with” “and  girls” asked somel “ohgirlswhy they like them too”  said but his voice flatted  little they always noticed little things like that we found later little  little they wrung  us  fact   friend  man   city   prisoner  taken out  his meager exercise   leash  liable not only  many diseases but   one destroying horror  rabies and  many cases   safety   citizens had  go muzzled jeff maliciously added vivid instances  had known or read  injury  death  mad dogs they did not scold or fuss about it calm  judges those women were but they made notes moadine read them  us “please tell me if i have  facts correct” she said “in your countryand  others too” “yes” we admitted “in most civilized countries” “in most civilized countries  kind  animal  kept which  no longer useful” “they   protection” terry insisted “they bark if burglars try  get in” then she made notes  “burglars”  went on “because   love which people bear  this animal” zava interrupted here “is   men or  women who love this animal so much” “both” insisted terry “equally” she inquired and jeff said “nonsense terryyou know men like dogs better than women doas  whole” “because they love  so muchespecially men this animal  kept shut up or chained” “why” suddenly asked somel “we keep our father cats shut up because we do not want too much fathering but they  not chainedthey have large grounds  run in” “a valuable dog would  stolen if   let loose” i said “we put collars  them   owner’s name  case they do stray besides they get into fightsa valuable dog might easily  killed   bigger one” “i see” she said “they fight when they meetis  common” we admitted   was “they  kept shut up or chained” she paused again  asked “is not  dog fond  running are they not built  speed” that we admitted too  jeff still malicious enlightened them further “i’ve always thought    pathetic sight both waysto see  man or  woman taking  dog  walkat  end   string” “have you bred them    neat  their habits  cats are”   next question and when jeff told them   effect  dogs  sidewalk merchandise   streets generally they found  hard  believe you see their country   neat   dutch kitchen    sanitationbut i might  well start  now   much  i can remember   history  this amazing country before further description and i’ll summarize here  bit   our opportunities  learning it i  not try  repeat  careful detailed account i lost i’ll just say  we  kept   fortress  good six months all told  after that three   pleasant enough city whereto terry’s infinite disgustthere  only “colonels”  little childrenno young women whatever then we  under surveillance  three morealways   tutor or  guard or both but those months  pleasant because we  really getting acquainted   girls that   chapteror  bei  try  do justice  it we learned their language pretty thoroughlyhad to  they learned ours much more quickly  used   hasten our own studies jeff who  never without reading matter  some sort had two little books  him  novel   little anthology  verse  i had one  those pocket encyclopediasa fat little thing bursting  facts these  used  our educationand theirs then  soon  we  up  it they furnished us  plenty  their own books  i went    history parti wanted  understand  genesis  this miracle  theirs and this  what happened according  their records as  geographyat about  time   christian era this land had  free passage   sea i’m not saying where  good reasons but there   fairly easy pass through  wall  mountains behind us  there  no doubt  my mind  these people   aryan stock   once  contact   best civilization   old world they  “white” but somewhat darker than our northern races because  their constant exposure  sun  air the country  far larger then including much land beyond  pass   strip  coast they had ships commerce  army  kingfor   time they  what they so calmly called usa bisexual race what happened  them first  merely  succession  historic misfortunes such  have befallen other nations often enough they  decimated  war driven up  their coastline till finally  reduced population  many   men killed  battle occupied this hinterland  defended   years   mountain passes where   open  any possible attack  below they strengthened  natural defenses so   became unscalably secure  we found it they   polygamous people   slaveholding people like all  their time  during  generation or two  this struggle  defend their mountain home they built  fortresses such   one we  held in  other  their oldest buildings some still  use nothing but earthquakes could destroy such architecturehuge solid blocks holding  their own weight they must have had efficient workmen  enough  them  those days they made  brave fight  their existence but no nation can stand up against what  steamship companies call “an act  god” while  whole fighting

there  many  them  but few  these wouldbe masters so  young women instead  submitting rose  sheer desperation  slew their brutal conquerors this sounds like titus andronicus i know but   their account i suppose they  about crazycan you blame them there  literally no one left  this beautiful high garden land but  bunch  hysterical girls  some older slave women that  about two thousand years ago at first there   period  sheer despair the mountains towered between them  their old enemies but also between them  escape there  no way up or down or outthey simply had  stay there some   suicide but

masculine characteristics which  course we did not look for but so much  what we had always thought essentially feminine the tradition  men  guardians  protectors had quite died out these stalwart virgins had no men  fear  therefore no need  protection as  wild beaststhere  none  their sheltered land the power  motherlove  maternal instinct we so highly laud  theirs  course raised   highest power   sisterlove which even while recognizing  actual relationship we found  hard  credit terry incredulous even contemptuous when we  alone refused  believe  story “a lot  traditions  old  herodotusand about  trustworthy”  said “it’s likely womenjust  pack  womenwould have hung together like that we all know women can’t organizethat they scrap like anythingare frightfully jealous” “but these new ladies didn’t have anyone   jealous of remember” drawled jeff “that’s  likely story” terry sneered “why don’t you invent  likelier one” i asked him “here are  womennothing but women  you yourself admit there’s no trace   man   country” this  after we had been about  good deal “i’ll admit that”  growled “and it’s  big miss too there’s not only no fun without ‘emno real sportno competition but these women aren’t womanly you know they aren’t” that kind  talk always set jeff going  i gradually grew  side  him “then you don’t call  breed  women whose one concern  motherhoodwomanly”  asked “indeed i don’t” snapped terry “what does  man care  motherhoodwhen  hasn’t  ghost   chance  fatherhood and besideswhat’s  good  talking sentiment when we  just men together what  man wants  women   good deal more than all this ‘motherhood’” we   patient  possible  terry he had lived about nine months among  “colonels” when  made  outburst   no chance  any more strenuous excitement than our gymnastics gave ussave  our escape fiasco i don’t suppose terry had ever lived so long  neither love combat nor danger  employ his superabundant energies    irritable neither jeff nor i found  so wearing i  so much interested intellectually  our confinement did not wear  me    jeff bless his hearthe enjoyed  society   tutor  his almost  much  if she had been  girli don’t know but more as  terry’s criticism   true these women whose essential distinction  motherhood   dominant note  their whole culture  strikingly deficient  what we call “femininity” this led me very promptly   conviction  those “feminine charms” we  so fond   not feminine  all but mere reflected masculinitydeveloped  please us because they had  please us   no way essential   real fulfillment  their great process but terry came  no such conclusion “just you wait till i get out”  muttered then we both cautioned him “look here terry my boy you  careful they’ve been mighty good  usbut do you remember  anesthesia if you do any mischief  this virgin land beware   vengeance   maiden aunts come   man it won’t  forever” to return   history they began  once  plan  built  their children all  strength  intelligence   whole  them devoted   one thing each girl  course  reared  full knowledge  her crowning office  they had even then very high ideas   molding powers   mother  well  those  education such high ideals  they had beauty health strength intellect goodnessfor those they prayed  worked they had no enemies they themselves  all sisters  friends the land  fair before them   great future began  form itself  their minds the religion they had  begin   much like   old greecea number  gods  goddesses but they lost all interest  deities  war  plunder  gradually centered  their mother goddess altogether then  they grew more intelligent this had turned into  sort  maternal pantheism here  mother earth bearing fruit all  they ate  fruit  motherhood  seed or egg or their product by motherhood they  born   motherhood they livedlife was  them just  long cycle  motherhood but very early they recognized  need  improvement  well   mere repetition  devoted their combined intelligence   problemhow  make  best kind  people first this  merely  hope  bearing better ones  then they recognized  however  children differed  birth  real growth lay laterthrough education then things began  hum as i learned more  more  appreciate what these women had accomplished  less proud i   what we  all our manhood had done you see they had had no wars they had had no kings  no priests  no aristocracies they  sisters   they grew they grew togethernot  competition but  united action we tried  put   good word  competition  they  keenly interested indeed we soon found  their earnest questions  us  they  prepared  believe our world must  better than theirs they  not sure they wanted  know but there  no such arrogance about them  might have been expected we rather spread ourselves telling   advantages  competition how  developed fine qualities  without  there would  “no stimulus  industry” terry  very strong   point “no stimulus  industry” they repeated   puzzled look we had learned  know so well “stimulus to industry but don’t you like  work” “no man would work unless  had to” terry declared “oh no man you mean   one  your sex distinctions” “no indeed”  said hastily “no one i mean man or woman would work without incentive competition  thethe motor power you see” “it  not  us” they explained gently “so   hard  us  understand do you mean  instance   you no mother would work  her children without  stimulus  competition” no  admitted   did not mean that mothers  supposed would  course work  their children   home but  world’s work  differentthat had   done  men  required  competitive element all our teachers  eagerly interested “we want so much  knowyou have  whole world  tell us of  we have only our little land and there  two  youthe two sexesto love  help one another it must   rich  wonderful world tell uswhat   work   world  men dowhich we have not here” “oh everything” terry said grandly “the men do everything  us” he squared his broad shoulders  lifted his chest “we do not allow our women  work women  lovedidolizedhonoredkept   home  care   children” “what  ‘the home’” asked somel  little wistfully but zava begged “tell me first do no women work really” “why yes” terry admitted “some have to   poorer sort” “about how manyin your country” “about seven or eight million” said jeff  mischievous  ever chapter  comparisons are odious i had always been proud  my country  course everyone is compared   other lands  other races i knew  united states  america had always seemed  me speaking modestly  good   best  them but just   cleareyed intelligent perfectly honest  wellmeaning child  frequently jar one’s selfesteem  innocent questions so did these women without  slightest appearance  malice or satire continually bring up points  discussion which we spent our best efforts  evading now  we  fairly proficient  their language had read  lot about their history  had given them  general outlines  ours they  able  press their questions closer so when jeff admitted  number  “women wage earners” we had they instantly asked   total population   proportion  adult women  found  there  but twenty million or so   outside “then  least  third  your women arewhat   you call themwage earners and they  all poor what  poor exactly” “ours   best country   world   poverty” terry told them “we do not have  wretched paupers  beggars   older countries i assure you why european visitors tell us we don’t know what poverty is” “neither do we” answered zava “won’t you tell us” terry put  up  me saying i   sociologist  i explained   laws  nature require  struggle  existence     struggle  fittest survive   unfit perish in our economic struggle i continued there  always plenty  opportunity   fittest  reach  top which they did  great numbers particularly  our country  where there  severe economic pressure  lowest classes  course felt   worst   among  poorest  all  women  driven into  labor market  necessity they listened closely   usual notetaking “about onethird then belong   poorest class” observed moadine gravely “and twothirds   ones who arehow   you so beautifully put it‘loved honored kept   home  care   children’ this inferior onethird have no children i suppose” jeffhe  getting  bad  they weresolemnly replied that   contrary  poorer they were  more children they had that too  explained   law  nature “reproduction   inverse proportion  individuation” “these ‘laws  nature’” zava gently asked “are they all  laws you have” “i should say not” protested terry “we have systems  law  go back thousands  thousands  yearsjust  you do no doubt”  finished politely “oh no” moadine told him “we have no laws over  hundred years old  most  them  under twenty in  few weeks more” she continued “we  going  have  pleasure  showing you over our little land  explaining everything you care  know about we want you  see our people” “and i assure you” somel added “that our people want  see you” terry brightened up immensely  this news  reconciled himself   renewed demands upon our capacity  teachers it  lucky  we knew so little really  had no books  refer to else i fancy we might all  there yet teaching those eagerminded women about  rest   world as  geography they had  tradition   great sea beyond  mountains  they could see  themselves  endless thickforested plains below themthat  all but   few records  their ancient conditionnot “before  flood”  them but before  mighty quake which had cut them off so completelythey  aware  there  other peoples  other countries in geology they  quite ignorant as  anthropology they had those same remnants  information about other peoples   knowledge   savagery   occupants  those dim forests below nevertheless they had inferred marvelously keen  inference  deduction their minds were  existence  development  civilization  other places much  we infer   other planets when our biplane came whirring over their heads   first scouting flight  ours they had instantly accepted   proof   high development  some where else  had prepared  receive us  cautiously  eagerly  we might prepare  welcome visitors who came “by meteor”  mars of historyoutside their ownthey knew nothing  course save  their ancient traditions of astronomy they had  fair working knowledgethat   very old science   it  surprising range  facility  mathematics physiology they  quite familiar with indeed when  came   simpler  more concrete sciences wherein  subject matter   hand  they had but  exercise their minds upon it  results  surprising they had worked out  chemistry  botany  physics  all  blends where  science touches  art or merges into  industry  such fullness  knowledge  made us feel like schoolchildren also we found this outas soon  we  free   country   further study  questionthat what one knew all knew   very considerable extent i talked later  little mountain girls   firdark valleys away up  their highest part   sunburned plainswomen  agile foresters all over  country  well  those   towns  everywhere there   same high level  intelligence some knew far more than others about one thingthey  specialized  course but all  them knew more about everythingthat is about everything  country  acquainted withthan   case  us we boast  good deal  our “high level  general intelligence”  our “compulsory public education” but  proportion  their opportunities they  far better educated than our people with what we told them  what sketches  models we  able  prepare they constructed  sort  working outline  fill   they learned more a big globe  made  our uncertain maps helped out  those   precious yearbook thing i had  tentatively indicated upon it they sat  eager groups masses  them who came   purpose  listened while jeff roughly ran over  geologic history   earth  showed them their own land  relation   others out   same pocket reference book  mine came facts  figures which  seized upon  placed  right relation  unerring acumen even terry grew interested  this work “if we can keep this up they’ll  having us lecture  all  girls’ schools  collegeshow about that”  suggested  us “don’t know  i’d object  being  authority  such audiences” they did  fact urge us  give public lectures later but not   hearers or   purpose we expected what they  doing  us  likelikewell say like napoleon extracting military information   few illiterate peasants they knew just what  ask  just what use  make  it they had mechanical appliances  disseminating information almost equal  ours  home    time we  led forth  lecture our audiences had thoroughly mastered  wellarranged digest  all we had previously given  our teachers   prepared  such notes  questions  might have intimidated  university professor they  not audiences  girls either it  some time before we  allowed  meet  young women “do you mind telling what you intend  do  us” terry burst forth one day facing  calm  friendly moadine   funny halfblustering air  his at first  used  storm  flourish quite  good deal but nothing seemed  amuse them more they would gather around  watch him  if    exhibition politely but  evident interest so  learned  check himself   almost reasonable  his bearingbut not quite she announced smoothly  evenly “not   least i thought   quite plain we  trying  learn  you all we can   teach you what you  willing  learn  our country” “is  all”  insisted she smiled  quiet enigmatic smile “that depends” “depends  what” “mainly  yourselves” she replied “why do you keep us shut up so closely” “because we do not feel quite safe  allowing you  large where there  so many young women” terry  really pleased  that he had thought  much inwardly but  pushed  question “why should you  afraid we  gentlemen” she smiled  little smile again  asked “are ‘gentlemen’ always safe” “you surely do not think  any  us”  said    good deal  emphasis   “us” “would hurt your young girls” “oh no” she said quickly  real surprise “the danger  quite  other way they might hurt you if  any accident you did harm any one  us you would have  face  million mothers” he looked so amazed  outraged  jeff  i laughed outright but she went  gently “i do not think you quite understand yet you  but men three men   country where  whole population  mothersor  going  be motherhood means  us something which i cannot yet discover  any   countries  which you tell us you have spoken”she turned  jeff “of human brotherhood   great idea among you but even  i judge  far   practical expression” jeff nodded rather sadly “very far”  said “here we have human motherhoodin full working use” she went on “nothing else except  literal sisterhood  our origin   far higher  deeper union  our social growth “the children  this country   one center  focus  all our thoughts every step  our advance  always considered   effect  themon  race you see we  mothers” she repeated  if   she had said  all “i don’t see how  factwhich  shared  all womenconstitutes any risk  us” terry persisted “you mean they would defend their children  attack of course any mothers would but we  not savages my dear lady we  not going  hurt any mother’s child” they looked  one another  shook their heads  little but zava turned  jeff  urged him  make us seesaid  seemed  understand more fully than we did and  tried i can see  now or  least much more  it but   taken me  long time   good deal  honest intellectual effort what they call motherhood  like this they began   really high degree  social development something like   ancient egypt or greece then they suffered  loss  everything masculine  supposed  first  all human power  safety had gone too then they developed this virgin birth capacity then since  prosperity  their children depended  it  fullest  subtlest coordination began   practiced i remember how long terry balked   evident unanimity  these womenthe most conspicuous feature  their whole culture “it’s impossible”  would insist “women cannot cooperateit’s against nature” when we urged  obvious facts  would say “fiddlesticks” or “hang your factsi tell you  can’t  done” and we never succeeded  shutting him up till jeff dragged   hymenoptera “‘go   ant thou sluggard’and learn something”  said triumphantly “don’t they cooperate pretty well you can’t beat it this place  just like  enormous anthillyou know  anthill  nothing but  nursery and how about bees don’t they manage  cooperate  love one another   precious constable had it just show me  combination  male creatures bird bug or beast  works  well  you or one  our masculine countries where  people work together  well  they do here i tell you women   natural cooperators not men” terry had  learn  good many things  did not want to to go back  my little analysis  what happened they developed all this close interservice   interests  their children to do  best work they had  specialize  course  children needed spinners  weavers farmers  gardeners carpenters  masons  well  mothers then came  filling up   place when  population multiplies  five every thirty years  soon reaches  limits   country especially  small one like this they very soon eliminated all  grazing cattlesheep   last  go i believe also they worked out  system  intensive agriculture surpassing anything i ever heard of   very forests all reset  fruit or nutbearing trees do what they would however there soon came  time when they  confronted   problem  “the pressure  population”   acute form there  really crowding   it unavoidably  decline  standards and how did those women meet it not   “struggle  existence” which would result   everlasting writhing mass  underbred people trying  get ahead  one anothersome few  top temporarily many constantly crushed out underneath  hopeless substratum  paupers  degenerates  no serenity or peace  anyone no possibility  really noble qualities among  people  large neither did they start off  predatory excursions  get more land  somebody else or  get more food  somebody else  maintain their struggling mass not  all they sat down  council together  thought  out very clear strong thinkers they were they said “with our best endeavors this country  support about so many people   standard  peace comfort health beauty  progress we demand very well that  all  people we  make” there you have it you see they  mothers not  our sense  helpless involuntary fecundity forced  fill  overfill  land every land  then see their children suffer sin  die fighting horribly  one another but   sense  conscious makers  people motherlove  them  not  brute passion  mere “instinct”  wholly personal feeling  wasa religion it included  limitless feeling  sisterhood  wide unity  service which  so difficult  us  grasp and   national racial humanoh i don’t know how  say it we  used  seeing what we call “a mother” completely wrapped up  her own pink bundle  fascinating babyhood  taking but  faintest theoretic interest  anybody else’s bundle  say nothing   common needs  all  bundles but these women  working all together   grandest  tasksthey  making peopleand they made them well there followed  period  “negative eugenics” which must have been  appalling sacrifice we  commonly willing  “lay down our lives”  our country but they had  forego motherhood  their countryand   precisely  hardest thing  them  do when i got this far  my reading i went  somel  more light we   friendly   time  i had ever been  my life  any woman a mighty comfortable soul she was giving one  nice smooth motherfeeling  man likes   woman  yet giving also  clear intelligence  dependableness i used  assume   masculine qualities we had talked volumes already “see here” said i “here  this dreadful period when they got far too thick  decided  limit  population we have  lot  talk about  among us but your position  so different  i’d like  know  little more about it “i understand  you make motherhood  highest social servicea sacrament really    only undertaken once   majority   population  those held unfit  not allowed even that     encouraged  bear more than one child   very highest reward  honor   power   state” she interpolated here   nearest approach   aristocracy they had   come   line  “over mothers”those who had been so honored “but what i do not understand naturally  how you prevent it i gathered  each woman had five you have no tyrannical husbands  hold  checkand you surely do not destroy  unborn” the look  ghastly horror she gave me i shall never forget she started  her chair pale her eyes blazing “destroy  unborn” she said   hard whisper “do men do   your country” “men” i began  answer rather hotly  then saw  gulf before me none  us wanted these women  think  our women  whom we boasted so proudly   any way inferior  them i am ashamed  say  i equivocated i told her  certain criminal types  womenperverts or crazy who had been known  commit infanticide i told her truly enough  there  much  our land which  open  criticism but  i hated  dwell  our defects until they understood us  our conditions better and making  wide detour i scrambled back  my question  how they limited  population as  somel she seemed sorry  little ashamed even  her too clearly expressed amazement as i look back now knowing them better i am more  more  more amazed  i appreciate  exquisite courtesy  which they had received over  over again statements  admissions  our part which must have revolted them   soul she explained  me  sweet seriousness   i had supposed  first each woman bore five children  that  their eager desire  build up  nation they had gone    way   few centuries till they  confronted   absolute need   limit this fact  equally plain  allall  equally interested they  now  anxious  check their wonderful power  they had been  develop it   some generations gave  matter their most earnest thought  study “we  living  rations before we worked  out” she said “but we did work  out you see before  child comes  one  us there   period  utter exaltationthe whole being  uplifted  filled   concentrated desire   child we learned  look forward   period   greatest caution often our young women those  whom motherhood had not yet come would voluntarily defer it when  deep inner demand   child began   felt she would deliberately engage   most active work physical  mental  even more important would solace her longing   direct care  service   babies we already had” she paused her wise sweet face grew deeply reverently tender “we soon grew  see  motherlove  more than one channel  expression i think  reason our children  soso fully loved  all  us   we neverany  ushave enough  our own” this seemed  me infinitely pathetic  i said so “we have much   bitter  hard  our life  home” i told her “but this seems  me piteous beyond wordsa whole nation  starving mothers” but she smiled her deep contented smile  said i quite misunderstood “we each go without  certain range  personal joy” she said “but rememberwe each have  million children  love  serveour children” it  beyond me to hear  lot  women talk about “our children” but i suppose    way  ants  bees would talkdo talk maybe that  what they did anyhow when  woman chose    mother she allowed  childlonging  grow within her till  worked  natural miracle when she did not so choose she put  whole thing out  her mind  fed her heart   other babies let me seewith us childrenminors  isconstitute about threefifths   population  them only about onethird or less and precious no sole heir   empire’s throne no solitary millionaire baby no only child  middleaged parents could compare   idol  these herland children but before i start   subject i must finish up  little analysis i  trying  make they did effectually  permanently limit  population  numbers so   country furnished plenty   fullest richest life  all  them plenty  everything including room air solitude even and then they set  work  improve  population  qualitysince they  restricted  quantity this they had been  work on uninterruptedly  some fifteen hundred years do you wonder they  nice people physiology hygiene sanitation physical cultureall  line  work had been perfected long since sickness  almost wholly unknown among them so much so   previously high development  what we call  “science  medicine” had become practically  lost art they   cleanbred vigorous lot having  best  care  most perfect living conditions always when  came  psychologythere  no one thing which left us so dumbfounded so really awed   everyday working knowledgeand practicethey had  this line as we learned more  more  it we learned  appreciate  exquisite mastery  which we ourselves strangers  alien race  unknown opposite sex had been understood  provided    first with this wide deep thorough knowledge they had met  solved  problems  education  ways some  which i hope  make clear later those nationloved children  theirs compared   average  our country   most perfectly cultivated richly developed roses compare withtumbleweeds yet they did not seem “cultivated”  allit had all become  natural condition and this people steadily developing  mental capacity   power  social devotion had been playing   arts  sciencesas far  they knew themfor  good many centuries now  inevitable success into this quiet lovely land among these wise sweet strong women we  our easy assumption  superiority had suddenly arrived  now tamed  trained   degree they considered safe we   last brought out  see  country  know  people chapter  our growing modesty being  last considered sufficiently tamed  trained   trusted  scissors we barbered ourselves  best we could a closetrimmed beard  certainly more comfortable than  full one razors naturally they could not supply “with so many old women you’d think there’d  some razors” sneered terry whereat jeff pointed out   never before had seen such complete absence  facial hair  women “looks  me  if  absence  men made them more feminine   regard anyhow”  suggested “well it’s  only one then” terry reluctantly agreed “a less feminine lot i never saw a child apiece doesn’t seem   enough  develop what i call motherliness” terry’s idea  motherliness   usual one involving  baby  arms or “a little flock about her knees”   complete absorption   mother  said baby or flock a motherliness which dominated society which influenced every art  industry which absolutely protected all childhood  gave    most perfect care  training did not seem motherlyto terry we had become well used   clothes they  quite  comfortable  our ownin some ways more soand undeniably better looking as  pockets they left nothing   desired that second garment  fairly quilted  pockets they  most ingeniously arranged so    convenient   hand  not inconvenient   body   so placed   once  strengthen  garment  add decorative lines  stitching in this   so many other points we had now  observe there  shown  action   practical intelligence coupled  fine artistic feeling and apparently untrammeled  any injurious influences our first step  comparative freedom   personally conducted tour   country no pentagonal bodyguard now only our special tutors  we got  famously  them jeff said  loved zava like  aunt“only jollier than any aunt i ever saw” somel  i   chummy  could bethe best  friends but   funny  watch terry  moadine she  patient  him  courteous but   like  patience  courtesy  some great man say  skilled experienced diplomat   schoolgirl her grave acquiescence  his most preposterous expression  feeling her genial laughter not only with but i often felt  himthough impeccably polite her innocent questions which almost invariably led him  say more than  intendedjeff  i found  all amusing  watch he never seemed  recognize  quiet background  superiority when she dropped  argument  always thought  had silenced her when she laughed  thought  tribute  his wit i hated  admit  myself how much terry had sunk  my esteem jeff felt  too i am sure but neither  us admitted    other at home we had measured him  other men and though we knew his failings    no means  unusual type we knew his virtues too  they had always seemed more prominent than  faults measured among womenour women  home i meanhe had always stood high he  visibly popular even where his habits  known there  no discrimination against him  some cases his reputation  what  felicitously termed “gaiety” seemed  special charm but here against  calm wisdom  quiet restrained humor  these women  only  blessed jeff  my inconspicuous self  compare with terry did stand out rather strong as “a man among men”  didn’t   man amongi shall have  say “females”  didn’t his intense masculinity seemed only fit complement  their intense femininity but here   all out  drawing moadine   big woman   balanced strength  seldom showed her eye   quietly watchful   fencer’s she maintained  pleasant relation  her charge but i doubt if many even   country could have done  well he called her “maud” amongst ourselves  said she  “a good old soul but  little slow” wherein   quite wrong needless  say  called jeff’s teacher “java”  sometimes “mocha” or plain “coffee” when specially mischievous “chicory”  even “postum” but somel rather escaped this form  humor save   rather forced “some ‘ell” “don’t you people have but one name”  asked one day after we had been introduced   whole group  them all  pleasant fewsyllabled strange names like  ones we knew “oh yes” moadine told him “a good many  us have another  we get   lifea descriptive one that   name we earn sometimes even   changed or added to   unusually rich life such  our present land motherwhat you call president or king i believe she  called mera even   child  means ‘thinker’ later there  added dudumerathe wise thinker  now we all know her  odumeragreat  wise thinker you shall meet her” “no surnames  all then” pursued terry  his somewhat patronizing air “no family name” “why no” she said “why should we we  all descended   common sourceall one ‘family’  reality you see our comparatively brief  limited history gives us  advantage  least” “but does not each mother want her own child  bear her name” i asked “nowhy should she the child   own” “why forfor identificationso people  know whose child she is” “we keep  most careful records” said somel “each one  us  our exact line  descent all  way back  our dear first mother there  many reasons  doing that but   everyone knowing which child belongs  which motherwhy should she” here   so many other instances we  led  feel  difference between  purely maternal   paternal attitude  mind the element  personal pride seemed strangely lacking “how about your other works” asked jeff “don’t you sign your names  thembooks  statues  so on” “yes surely we  all glad  proud to not only books  statues but all kinds  work you  find little names   houses   furniture   dishes sometimes because otherwise one  likely  forget  we want  know  whom   grateful” “you speak  if   done   convenience   consumernot  pride   producer” i suggested “it’s both” said somel “we have pride enough  our work” “then why not  your children” urged jeff “but we have we’re magnificently proud  them” she insisted “then why not sign ‘em” said terry triumphantly moadine turned  him  her slightly quizzical smile “because  finished product  not  private one when they  babies we do speak  them  times  ‘essa’s lato’ or ‘novine’s amel’ but   merely descriptive  conversational in  records  course  child stands  her own line  mothers but  dealing   personally   lato or amel without dragging   ancestors” “but have you names enough  give  new one  each child” “assuredly we have  each living generation” then they asked about our methods  found first  “we” did so  so  then  other nations did differently upon which they wanted  know which method  been proved bestand we had  admit  so far  we knew there had been no attempt  comparison each people pursuing  own custom   fond conviction  superiority  either despising or quite ignoring  others with these women  most salient quality

parthenogenetic they’d   alike  so many ants or aphids  urged their visible differences  proof  there must  mensomewhere but when we asked them  our later more intimate conversations how they accounted  so much divergence without crossfertilization they attributed  partly   careful education which followed each slight tendency  differ  partly   law  mutation this they had found  their work

variation “it certainly should be” zava admitted “we have always thought   grave initial misfortune  have lost half our little world perhaps   one reason why we have so striven  conscious improvement” “but acquired traits  not transmissible” terry declared “weissman  proved that” they never disputed our absolute statements only made notes  them “if   so then our improvement must  due either

who showed  same delicate courtesy   equally pleasant  live with  least when they wore their “company manners” we had assumed  our companions   carefully chosen few later we  more  more impressed  all this gentle breeding  breeding  they  born  it reared  it     natural  universal  them   gentleness  doves or  alleged wisdom  serpents as   intelligence i confess  this   most impressive and  me most mortifying  any single feature  herland we soon ceased  comment  this or other matters which  them  such obvious commonplaces   call forth embarrassing questions about our own conditions this  nowhere better shown than   matter  food supply which i  now attempt  describe having improved their agriculture   highest point  carefully estimated  number  persons who could comfortably live  their square

had never seen had scarcely imagined human beings undertaking such  work   deliberate replanting   entire forest area  different kinds  trees yet this seemed  them  simplest common sense like  man’s

beautiful  they wished  keep it for nine hundred years they had experimented  now showed us this particularly lovely graceful tree   profuse crop  nutritious seeds they had early decided  trees   best food plants requiring far less labor  tilling  soil  bearing  larger amount  food   same ground space also doing much  preserve  enrich  soil due regard had been paid  seasonable crops  their fruit

like   any healthy forest  increasingly valuable soil  being built instead   progressive impoverishment so often seen   rest   world when this first burst upon us we made such approving comments  they  surprised  such obvious common sense should  praised asked what our methods were  we had some difficulty inwell  diverting them  referring   extent  our own land  theadmittedcarelessness  which we had skimmed  cream  it at least we thought we had diverted them later i found  besides keeping  careful  accurate account  all we told them they had  sort  skeleton chart  which  things we said   things we palpably avoided saying  all set down  studied it really  child’s play  those profound educators  work out  painfully accurate estimate  our conditionsin some lines when  given line  observation seemed  lead  some very dreadful inference they always gave us  benefit   doubt leaving  open  further knowledge some   things we had grown  accept  perfectly natural or  belonging  our human limitations they literally could not have believed and  i have said we had all  us joined   tacit endeavor  conceal much   social status  home “confound their grandmotherly minds” terry said “of course they can’t understand  man’s world they aren’t humanthey’re just  pack  fefefemales” this  after  had  admit their parthenogenesis “i wish our grandfatherly minds had managed  well” said jeff “do you really think it’s  our credit  we have muddled along  all our poverty  disease   like they have peace  plenty wealth  beauty goodness  intellect pretty good people i think” “you’ll find they have their faults too” terry insisted  partly  selfdefense we all three began  look  those faults  theirs we had been very strong  this subject before we got therein those baseless speculations  ours “suppose there   country  women only” jeff had put it over  over “what’ll they  like” and we had been cocksure    inevitable limitations  faults  vices   lot  women we had expected them   given over  what we called “feminine vanity”“frills  furbelows”  we found they had evolved  costume more perfect than  chinese dress richly beautiful when so desired always useful  unfailing dignity  good taste we had expected  dull submissive monotony  found  daring social inventiveness far beyond our own   mechanical  scientific development fully equal  ours we had expected pettiness  found  social consciousness besides which our nations looked like quarreling childrenfeebleminded ones  that we had expected jealousy  found  broad sisterly affection  fairminded intelligence  which we could produce no parallel we had expected hysteria  found  standard  health  vigor  calmness  temper  which  habit  profanity  instance  impossible  explainwe tried it all these things even terry had  admit but  still insisted  we should find out  other side pretty soon “it stands  reason doesn’t it”  argued “the whole thing’s deuced unnaturali’d say impossible if we weren’t  it and  unnatural condition’s sure  have unnatural results you’ll find some awful characteristicssee if you don’t for instancewe don’t know yet what they do  their criminalstheir defectivestheir aged you notice we haven’t seen any there’s got   something” i  inclined  believe  there had   something so i took  bull   hornsthe cow i should sayand asked somel “i want  find some flaw  all this perfection” i told her flatly “it simply isn’t possible  three million people have no faults we  trying our best  understand  learnwould you mind helping us  saying what  your minds   worst qualities  this unique

room space  sunny breezy freedom everywhere somel set her chin upon her hand her elbow   low wall beside her  looked off over  fair land “of course we have faultsall  us” she said “in one way you might say  we have more than we used tothat is our standard  perfection seems  get farther  farther away but we  not discouraged because our records do show gainconsiderable gain “when we beganeven

call  ‘criminal’ “we have  course made  our first business  train out  breed out when possible  lowest types” “breed out” i asked “how could youwith parthenogenesis” “if  girl showing  bad qualities had still  power  appreciate social duty we appealed  her  that  renounce motherhood some   few worst types were fortunately unable  reproduce but if  fault    disproportionate egotismthen  girl  sure she had  right  have children even  hers would  better than others” “i can see that” i said “and then she would  likely  rear them   same spirit” “that we never allowed” answered somel quietly “allowed” i queried “allowed  mother  rear her own children” “certainly not” said somel “unless she  fit   supreme task” this  rather  blow  my previous convictions “but i thought motherhood   each  you” “motherhoodyes  is maternity  bear  child but education  our highest art only allowed  our highest artists” “education” i  puzzled again “i don’t mean education i mean  motherhood not only childbearing but  care  babies” “the care  babies involves education   entrusted only   most fit” she repeated “then you separate mother  child” i cried  cold horror something  terry’s feeling creeping over me  there must  something wrong among these many virtues “not usually” she patiently explained “you see almost every woman values her maternity above everything else each girl holds  close  dear  exquisite joy  crowning honor  most intimate most personal most precious thing that is  childrearing  come    us  culture so profoundly studied practiced  such subtlety  skill   more we love our children  less we  willing  trust  process  unskilled handseven our own” “but  mother’s love” i ventured she studied my face trying  work out  means  clear explanation “you told us about your dentists” she said  length “those quaintly specialized persons who spend their lives filling little holes  other persons’ teetheven  children’s teeth sometimes” “yes” i said not getting her drift “does motherlove urge motherswith youto fill their own children’s teeth or  wish to” “why noof course not” i protested “but    highly specialized craft surely  care  babies  open  any womanany mother” “we do not think so” she gently replied “those  us who   most highly competent fulfill  office   majority  our girls eagerly try  iti assure you we have  very best” “but  poor motherbereaved  her baby” “oh no” she earnestly assured me “not   least bereaved it  her baby stillit   hershe  not lost it but she  not  only one  care  it there  others whom she knows   wiser she knows  because she  studied  they did practiced  they did  honors their real superiority for  child’s sake she  glad  have   this highest care” i  unconvinced besides this  only hearsay i had yet  see  motherhood

which i saw  flickering little smile cross moadine’s face even then  all those eager young things waiting  talk  us  sudden question crossed my mind “what  their point  view what did they think  us” we learned  later terry plunged  among those young creatures   sort  rapture somewhat   glad swimmer takes   sea jeff   rapt look  his highbred face approached    sacrament but i   little chilled   last thought  mine  kept my eyes open i found time  watch jeff even while i  surrounded   eager group  questionersas we all wereand saw how his worshipping eyes his grave courtesy pleased  drew some  them while others rather stronger spirits they looked  be drew away  his group  terry’s or mine i watched terry  special interest knowing how  had longed  this time  how irresistible  had always been  home and i could see just  snatches  course how his suave  masterful approach seemed  irritate them his toointimate glances  vaguely resented his compliments puzzled  annoyed sometimes  girl would flush not  drooped eyelids  inviting timidity but  anger   quick lift   head girl after girl turned  her heel  left him till  had but  small ring  questioners  they visibly   least “girlish”   lot i saw him looking pleased  first  if  thought   making  strong impression but finally casting  look  jeff or me  seemed less pleasedand less as  me i  most agreeably surprised at home i never  “popular” i had my girl friends good ones but they  friendsnothing else also they   somewhat  same clan not popular   sense  swarming admirers but here  my astonishment i found my crowd   largest i have  generalize  course rather telescoping many impressions but  first evening   good sample   impression we made jeff had  following if i may call  that   more sentimentalthough that’s not  word i want the less practical perhaps  girls who  artists  some sort ethicists teachersthat kind terry  reduced   rather combative group keen logical inquiring minds not overly sensitive  very kind  liked least while   mei became quite cocky over my general popularity terry  furious about it we could hardly blame him “girls”  burst forth when  evening  over  we   ourselves once more “call those girls” “most delightful girls i call them” said jeff his blue eyes dreamily contented “what do you call them” i mildly inquired “boys nothing but boys most  ‘em a standoffish disagreeable lot  that critical impertinent youngsters no girls  all” he  angry  severe not  little jealous too i think afterward when  found out just what   they did not like  changed his manner somewhat  got  better he had to for  spite  his criticism they  girls and furthermore all  girls there were always excepting our threewith whom we presently renewed our acquaintance when  came  courtship which  soon did i can  course best describe my ownand am least inclined to but  jeff i heard somewhat   inclined  dwell reverently  admiringly  some length   exalted sentiment  measureless perfection  his celis  terryterry made so

two thousand years since they had had anything   afraid of  certainly more than one thousand since they had outgrown  feeling we thoughtat least terry didthat we could have our pick  them they

course   bisexual race  distinctive feature  each sex must  intensified but surely there  characteristics enough which belong  people aren’t there that’s what i mean about you being more like usmore

jeff’s ultradevotion rather puzzled celis really put off their day  happiness while terry  alima quarreled  parted remet  reparted ellador  i grew   close friends we talked  talked we took long walks

said i had never cared very much  women nor they  menot terryfashion but this one at first i never even thought  her “in  way”   girls have it i had not come   country  any turkishharem intentions  i  no womanworshipper like jeff i just liked  girl “as  friend”  we say that friendship grew like  tree she  such  good sport we did all kinds  things together she taught me games  i taught her games  we

among them she  noble her mother   over motherand her grandmother too i heard later so she told me more  more  her beautiful land  i told her  much yes more than i wanted to about mine  we became inseparable then this deeper recognition came  grew i felt my own soul rise  lift  wings   were life got bigger it seemed  if i understoodas i never had beforeas if i could do thingsas if i too could

people   studied  them their claim  recognized   wise leaders but i felt we all did  we should have chosen them among millions unerringly and yet “the path  true love never did run smooth” this period

whole relation turns  beauty  ashes here everything  different there  no sexfeeling  appeal to or practically none two thousand years’ disuse had left very little   instinct also we must remember  those who had  times manifested   atavistic exceptions  often   very fact denied motherhood yet while  mother process remains  inherent ground  sexdistinction remains also  who shall say what longforgotten feeling vague  nameless  stirred  some  these mother hearts  our arrival what left us even more  sea  our approach   lack  any sextradition there  no accepted standard  what  “manly”  what  “womanly” when jeff said taking  fruit basket  his adored one “a woman should not carry anything” celis said “why”   frankest amazement he could not look  fleetfooted deepchested young forester   face  say “because she  weaker” she wasn’t one does not call  race horse weak because   visibly not  cart horse he said rather lamely  women  not built  heavy work she looked out across  fields  where some women  working building  new bit  wall out  large stones looked back   nearest town   womanbuilt houses down   smooth hard road we  walking on  then   little basket  had taken  her “i don’t understand” she said quite sweetly “are  women  your country so weak  they could not carry such  thing  that” “it   convention”  said “we assume  motherhood   sufficient burdenthat men should carry all  others” “what  beautiful feeling” she said her blue eyes shining “does  work” asked alima  her keen swift way “do all men  all countries carry everything or   only  yours” “don’t  so literal” terry begged lazily “why aren’t you willing   worshipped  waited on we like  do it” “you don’t like  have us do   you” she answered “that’s different”  said annoyed  when she said “why  it”  quite sulked referring her  me saying “van’s  philosopher” ellador  i talked  all out together so  we had  easier experience   when  real miracle time came also between us we made things clearer  jeff  celis but terry would not listen  reason he  madly  love  alima he wanted  take her  storm  nearly lost her forever you see if  man loves  girl who    first place young  inexperienced who   second

near enough  try again the more coldly she denied him  hotter his determination   not used  real refusal the approach  flattery she dismissed  laughter gifts  such “attentions” we could not bring  bear pathos  complaint  cruelty stirred only  reasoning inquiry it took terry  long time i doubt if she ever accepted her strange lover  fully  did celis  ellador theirs he had hurt  offended her too often there  reservations but i think alima retained some faint vestige  longdescended feeling which made terry more possible  her than  others   she had made up her mind   experiment  hated  renounce it however  came about we all three  length achieved full understanding  solemnly faced what   them  step  measureless importance  grave question  well   great happiness  us  strange new joy of marriage   ceremony they knew nothing jeff   bringing them  our country   religious   civil ceremony but neither celis nor  others would consent “we can’t expect them  want  go  usyet” said terry sagely “wait  bit boys we’ve got  take ‘em  their own termsif  all” this  rueful reminiscence  his repeated failures “but our time’s coming”  added cheerfully “these women have never been mastered you see” this  one who had made  discovery “you’d better not try  do any mastering if you value your chances” i told him seriously but  only laughed  said “every man  his trade” we couldn’t do anything  him he had  take his own medicine if  lack  tradition  courtship left us much  sea  our wooing we found ourselves still more bewildered  lack  tradition  matrimony and here again i have  draw  later

children from those first breathlessly guarded halfadored race mothers all up  ascending line they had this dominant thought  building up  great race through  children all  surrendering devotion our women have put into their private families these women put into their country  race all  loyalty  service men expect  wives they gave not singly  men but collectively  one another and  mother instinct  us so painfully intense so thwarted  conditions so concentrated  personal devotion   few so bitterly hurt  death disease or barrenness  even   mere growth   children leaving  mother alone  her empty nestall this feeling  them flowed out   strong wide current unbroken through  generations deepening  widening through  years including every child  all  land with their united power  wisdom they had studied  overcome  “diseases  childhood”their children had none they had faced  problems  education  so solved them  their children grew up  naturally  young trees learning through every sense taught continuously but unconsciouslynever knowing they  being educated in fact they did not use  word  we do their idea  education   special training they took when half grown up under experts then  eager young minds fairly flung themselves  their chosen subjects  acquired   ease  breadth  grasp  which i never ceased  wonder but  babies  little children never felt  pressure   “forcible feeding”   mind  we call “education” of this more later chapter  our relations  theirs what i’m trying  show here    these women  whole relationship  life counted   glad eager growingup  join  ranks  workers   line best loved  deep tender reverence  one’s own mothertoo deep  them  speak  freelyand beyond that  whole free wide range  sisterhood  splendid service   country  friendships to these women we came filled   ideas convictions traditions  our culture  undertook  rouse  them  emotions whichto usseemed proper however much or little  true sexfeeling there  between us  phrased itself  their minds  terms  friendship  one purely personal love they knew   ultimate parentage visibly we  not mothers nor children nor compatriots so if they loved us we must  friends that we should pair off together  our courting days  natural  them  we three should remain much together  they did themselves  also natural we had  yet no work so we hung about them  their forest tasks   natural too but when we began  talk about each couple having “homes”  our own they could not understand it “our work takes us all around  country” explained celis “we cannot live  one place all  time” “we  together now” urged alima looking proudly  terry’s stalwart nearness this  one   times when they  “on” though presently “off” again “it’s not  same thing  all”  insisted “a man wants  home  his own  his wife  family  it” “staying  it all  time” asked ellador “not imprisoned surely” “of course not living therenaturally”  answered “what does she do thereall  time” alima demanded “what  her work” then terry patiently explained again  our women did not workwith reservations “but what do they doif they have no work” she persisted “they take care   homeand  children” “at  same time” asked ellador “why yes the children play about   mother  charge   all there  servants  course” it seemed so obvious so natural  terry   always grew impatient but  girls  honestly anxious  understand “how many children do your women have” alima had her notebook out now   rather firm set  lip terry began  dodge “there  no set number my dear”  explained “some have more some have less” “some have none  all” i put  mischievously they pounced  this admission  soon wrung  us  general fact  those women who had  most children had  least servants  those who had  most servants had  least children “there” triumphed alima “one or two or no children  three or four servants now what do those women do” we explained  best we might we talked  “social duties” disingenuously banking  their not interpreting  words  we did we talked  hospitality entertainment  various “interests” all  time we knew   these largeminded women whose whole mental outlook  so collective  limitations   wholly personal life  inconceivable “we cannot really understand it” ellador concluded “we  only half  people we have our womanways  they have their manways  their bothways we have worked out  system  living which is  course limited they must have  broader richer better one i should like  see it” “you shall dearest” i whispered “there’s nothing  smoke” complained terry he    midst   prolonged quarrel  alima  needed  sedative “there’s nothing  drink these blessed women have no pleasant vices i wish we could get out  here” this wish  vain we  always under  certain degree  watchfulness when terry burst forth  tramp  streets

string  it “they’ve no unpleasant ones either” jeff reminded him “wish they had” terry persisted “they’ve neither  vices  men nor  virtues  womenthey’re neuters” “you know better than that don’t talk nonsense” said i severely i  thinking  ellador’s eyes when they gave me  certain look  look she did not  all realize jeff  equally incensed “i don’t know what ‘virtues  women’ you miss seems  me they have all  them” “they’ve no modesty” snapped terry “no patience no submissiveness none   natural yielding which  woman’s greatest charm” i shook my head pityingly “go  apologize  make friends again terry you’ve got  grouch that’s all these women have  virtue  humanity  less   faults than any folks i ever saw as  patiencethey’d have pitched us over  cliffs  first day we lit among ‘em if they

“home”  sneered “there isn’t  home   whole pitiful place” “there isn’t anything else  you know it” jeff retorted hotly “i never saw i never dreamed of such universal peace  good   mutual affection” “oh well  course if you like  perpetual sunday school it’s all very well but i like something doing here it’s all done” there  something  this criticism the years  pioneering lay far behind them theirs   civilization  which  initial difficulties had long since been overcome the untroubled peace  unmeasured plenty  steady health  large good   smooth management which ordered everything left nothing  overcome it  like  pleasant family   old established perfectly run country place i liked  because  my eager  continued interest   sociological achievements involved jeff liked    would have liked such  family  such  place anywhere terry did not like  because  found nothing  oppose  struggle with  conquer “life   struggle   be”  insisted “if there  no struggle there  no lifethat’s all” “you’re talking nonsensemasculine nonsense”  peaceful jeff replied he  certainly  warm defender  herland “ants don’t raise their myriads   struggle do they or  bees” “oh if you go back  insectsand

close together  instead  developing them  detached lines they had kept  connection let me try again  give if i can  faint sense   difference   life viewthe background  basis  which their culture rested ellador told me  lot about it she took me  see  children  growing girls  special teachers she picked out books  me  read she always seemed  understand just what i wanted  know  how  give   me while terry  alima struck sparks  partedhe always madly drawn  her  she  himshe must have been or she’d never have stood  way  behavedellador  i had already  deep restful feeling  if we’d always had one another jeff  celis  happy there  no question  that but  didn’t seem  me  if they had  good times we did well here   herland child facing lifeas ellador tried  show   me from  first memory they knew peace beauty order safety love wisdom justice patience  plenty by “plenty” i mean   babies grew up   environment which met their needs just  young fawns might grow up  dewy forest glades  brookfed meadows and they enjoyed   frankly  utterly   fawns would they found themselves   big bright lovely world full   most interesting  enchanting things  learn about   do the people everywhere

forester” said ellador “i  about eleven years old  i found  big purpleandgreen butterfly   low flower i caught it very carefully   closed wings  i had been told  do  carried    nearest insect teacher”i made  note there  ask her what  earth  insect teacher was“to ask her  name she took   me   little cry  delight ‘oh you blessed child’ she said ‘do you like obernuts’ of course i liked obernuts  said so it  our best foodnut you know ‘this   female   obernut moth’ she told me ‘they  almost gone we have been trying  exterminate them  centuries if you had not caught this one  might have laid eggs enough  raise worms enough  destroy thousands  our nut treesthousands  bushels  nutsand make years  years  trouble  us’ “everybody congratulated me the children all over  country  told

up   wide friendly world  knew   theirs   first their childliterature   wonderful thing i could have spent years following  delicate subtleties  smooth simplicities  which they had bent  great art

determination   what she  going   when she grew up what terry meant  saying they had no “modesty”   this great lifeview had no shady places they had  high sense  personal decorum but no shameno

culture beyond this perfect system  childrearing   range  interests  associations open  them all  life but   field  literature i  most struck  first   childmotive they had  same gradation  simple

youngsters vigorous joyous eager little creatures  their voracious appetite  life  shook my previous ideas so thoroughly  they have never been reestablished the steady level  good health gave them all  natural stimulus we used  call “animal spirits”an odd contradiction  terms they found themselves   immediate environment which  agreeable  interesting  before them stretched  years  learning  discovery  fascinating endless process  education as i looked into these methods  compared them  our own my strange uncomfortable sense  racehumility grew apace ellador could not understand my astonishment she explained things kindly  sweetly but  some amazement  they needed explaining   sudden questions   how we did   left me meeker than ever i betook myself  somel one day carefully not taking ellador i did not mind seeming foolish  somelshe  used  it “i want  chapter  explanation” i told her “you know my stupidities  heart  i do not want  show them  elladorshe thinks me so wise” she smiled delightedly “it  beautiful  see” she told me “this new wonderful love between you the whole country  interested you knowhow can we help it” i had not thought  that we say “all  world loves  lover” but  have  couple  million people watching one’s courtshipand   difficult onewas rather embarrassing “tell me about your theory  education” i said “make  short  easy and  show you what puzzles me i’ll tell you   our theory great stress  laid   forced exertion   child’s mind we think   good  him  overcome obstacles” “of course  is” she unexpectedly agreed “all our children do thatthey love to” that puzzled me again if they loved  do it how could   educational “our theory  this” she went  carefully “here   young human being the mind   natural  thing   body  thing  grows  thing  use  enjoy we seek  nourish  stimulate  exercise  mind   child  we do  body there   two main divisions  educationyou have those  coursethe things   necessary  know   things   necessary  do” “to do mental exercises you mean” “yes our general plan  this in  matter  feeding  mind  furnishing information we use our best powers  meet  natural appetite   healthy young brain not  overfeed it  provide such amount  variety  impressions  seem most welcome  each child that   easiest part the other division   arranging  properly graduated series  exercises which  best develop each mind  common faculties we all have  most carefully  especial faculties some  us have you do this also do you not” “in  way” i said rather lamely “we have not so subtle  highly developed  system  you not approaching it but tell me more as   informationhow do you manage it appears  all  you know pretty much everythingis  right” this she laughingly disclaimed “by no means we are  you soon found out extremely limited  knowledge i wish you could realize what  ferment  country   over  new things you have told us  passionate eagerness among thousands  us  go  your country  learnlearnlearn but what we do know  readily divisible into common knowledge  special knowledge the common knowledge we have long since learned  feed into  minds  our little ones  no waste  time or strength  special knowledge  open  all  they desire it

it  ours   among  between us   changes   succeeding  improving generations we   work slowly  carefully developing our whole people along these lines it  glorious worksplendid to see  thousands  babies improving showing stronger clearer minds sweeter dispositions higher capacitiesdon’t you find  so  your country” this i evaded flatly i remembered  cheerless claim   human mind  no better than   earliest period  savagery only better informeda statement i had never believed “we try most earnestly  two powers” somel continued “the two  seem  us basically necessary  all noble life  clear farreaching judgment   strong wellused will we spend our best efforts all through childhood  youth  developing these faculties individual judgment  will” “as part  your system  education you mean” “exactly as  most valuable part with  babies  you may have noticed we first provide  environment which feeds  mind without tiring it all manner  simple  interesting things  do  soon  they  old enough  do them physical properties  course come first but  early  possible going very carefully not  tax  mind we provide choices simple choices  very obvious causes  consequences you’ve noticed  games” i had the children seemed always playing something or else sometimes engaged  peaceful researches  their own i had wondered  first when they went  school but soon found  they never didto their knowledge it  all education but no schooling “we have been working  some sixteen hundred years devising better  better games  children” continued somel i sat aghast “devising games” i protested “making up new ones you mean” “exactly” she answered “don’t you” then i remembered  kindergarten   “material” devised  signora montessori  guardedly replied “to some extent” but most  our games i told her  very oldcame down  child  child along  ages   remote past “and what  their effect” she asked “do they develop  faculties you wish  encourage” again i remembered  claims made   advocates  “sports”  again replied guardedly   was  part  theory “but do  children like it” i asked “having things made up  set before them  way don’t they want  old games” “you can see  children” she answered “are yours more contentedmore interestedhappier” then i thought   truth i never had thought before   dull bored children i had seen whining “what can i do now”   little groups  gangs hanging about   value  some one strong spirit who possessed initiative  would “start something”   children’s parties   onerous duties   older people set  “amuse  children” also   troubled ocean  misdirected activity we call “mischief”  foolish destructive sometimes evil things done  unoccupied children “no” said i grimly “i don’t think they are” the herland child  born not only into  world carefully prepared full   most fascinating materials  opportunities  learn but into  society  plentiful numbers  teachers teachers born  trained whose business    accompany  children along that  us impossible thingthe royal road  learning there  no mystery  their methods being adapted  children    least comprehensible  adults i spent many days   little ones sometimes  ellador sometimes without  began  feel  crushing pity  my own childhood   all others  i had known the houses  gardens planned  babies had  them nothing  hurtno stairs no corners no small loose objects  swallow no firejust  babies’ paradise they  taught  rapidly  feasible  use  control their own bodies  never did i see such surefooted steadyhanded clearheaded little things it   joy  watch  row  toddlers learning  walk not only   level floor but  little later   sort  rubber rail raised  inch or two above  soft turf or heavy rugs  falling off  shrieks  infant joy  rush back   end   line  try again surely we have noticed how children love  get up  something  walk along it but we have never thought  provide  simple  inexhaustible form  amusement  physical education   young water they had  course  could swim even before they walked if i feared  first  effects   too intensive system  culture  fear  dissipated  seeing  long sunny days  pure physical merriment  natural sleep  which these heavenly babies passed their first years they never knew they  being educated they did not dream   this association  hilarious experiment  achievement they  laying  foundation   close beautiful group feeling into which they grew so firmly   years this  education  citizenship chapter  their religions  our marriages it took me  long time   man  foreigner   species  christiani    much  anythingto get any clear understanding   religion  herland its deification  motherhood  obvious enough but there  far more   than that or  least than my first interpretation  that i think   only  i grew  love ellador more than i believed anyone could love anybody  i grew faintly  appreciate her inner attitude  state  mind  i began  get some glimpses  this faith  theirs when i asked her about it she tried  first  tell me  then seeing me flounder asked  more information about ours she soon found  we had many  they varied widely but had some points  common a clear methodical luminous mind had my ellador not only reasonable but swiftly perceptive she made  sort  chart superimposing  different religions  i described them   pin run through them all   were their common basis being  dominant power or powers  some special behavior mostly taboos  please or placate there  some common features  certain groups  religions but  one always present  this power   things which must  done or not done because  it it  not hard  trace our human imagery   divine force up through successive stages  bloodthirsty sensual proud  cruel gods  early times   conception   common father   corollary   common brotherhood this pleased her very much  when i expatiated   omniscience omnipotence omnipresence  so on  our god    loving kindness taught  his son she  much impressed the story   virgin birth naturally did not astonish her but she  greatly puzzled   sacrifice  still more   devil   theory  damnation when   inadvertent moment i said  certain sects had believed  infant damnationand explained itshe sat very still indeed “they believed  god  loveand wisdomand power” “yesall  that” her eyes grew large her face ghastly pale “and yet  such  god could put little new babies  burnfor eternity” she fell into  sudden shuddering  left me running swiftly   nearest temple every smallest village had  temple   those gracious retreats sat wise  noble women quietly busy  some work  their own until they  wanted always ready  give comfort light or help  any applicant ellador told me afterward how easily this grief  hers  assuaged  seemed ashamed  not having helped herself out  it “you see we  not accustomed  horrible ideas” she said coming back  me rather apologetically “we haven’t any and when we get  thing like  into our minds it’s likeoh like red pepper  your eyes so i just ran  her blinded  almost screaming  she took  out so quicklyso easily” “how” i asked very curious “‘why you blessed child’ she said ‘you’ve got  wrong idea altogether you do not have  think  there ever  such  godfor there wasn’t or such  happeningfor there wasn’t nor even  this hideous false idea  believed  anybody but only thisthat people who  utterly ignorant  believe anythingwhich you certainly knew before’” “anyhow” pursued ellador “she turned pale   minute when i first said it” this   lesson  me no wonder this whole nation  women  peaceful  sweet  expressionthey had no horrible ideas “surely you had some when you began” i suggested “oh yes no doubt but  soon  our religion grew  any height  all we left them out  course” from this   many other things i grew  see what i finally put  words “have you no respect   past for what  thought  believed  your foremothers” “why no” she said “why should we they  all gone they knew less than we do if we  not beyond them we  unworthy  themand unworthy   children who must go beyond us” this set me thinking  good earnest i had always imaginedsimply  hearing  said i supposethat women   nature conservative yet these women quite unassisted  any masculine spirit  enterprise had ignored their past  built daringly   future ellador watched me think she seemed  know pretty much what  going   my mind “it’s because we began   new way i suppose all our folks  swept away  once  then after  time  despair came those wonder childrenthe first and then  whole breathless hope  us   their childrenif they should have them and they did then there   period  pride  triumph till we grew too numerous  after that when  all came down  one child apiece we began  really workto make better ones” “but how does this account  such  radical difference  your religion” i persisted she said she couldn’t talk about  difference very intelligently not being familiar  other religions but  theirs seemed simple enough their great mother spirit   them what their own motherhood wasonly magnified beyond human limits that meant  they felt beneath  behind them  upholding unfailing serviceable loveperhaps   really  accumulated motherlove   race they feltbut    power “just what  your theory  worship” i asked her “worship what  that” i found  singularly difficult  explain this divine love which they felt so strongly did not seem  ask anything  them“any more than our mothers do” she said “but surely your mothers expect honor reverence obedience  you you have  do things  your mothers surely” “oh no” she insisted smiling shaking her soft brown hair “we do things from our mothersnot for them we don’t have  do things for themthey don’t need it you know but we have  live onsplendidlybecause  them  that’s  way we feel about god” i meditated again i thought   god  battles  ours  jealous god  vengeanceismine god i thought  our worldnightmarehell “you have no theory  eternal punishment then i take it” ellador laughed her eyes   bright  stars  there  tears  them too she  so sorry  me “how could we” she asked fairly enough “we have no punishments  life you see so we don’t imagine them after death” “have you no punishments neither  children nor criminalssuch mild criminals  you have” i urged “do you punish  person   broken leg or  fever we have preventive measures  cures sometimes we have  ‘send  patient  bed’   were but that’s not  punishmentit’s only part   treatment” she explained then studying my point  view more closely she added “you see we recognize  our human motherhood  great tender limitless uplifting forcepatience  wisdom  all subtlety  delicate method we credit godour idea  godwith all   more our mothers  not angry  uswhy should god be” “does god mean  person  you” this she thought over  little “whyin trying  get close    our minds we personify  idea naturally but we certainly do not assume  big woman somewhere who  god what we call god   pervading power you know  indwelling spirit something inside  us  we want more of is your god  big man” she asked innocently “whyyes  most  us i think of course we call   indwelling spirit just  you do but we insist    him  person   manwith whiskers” “whiskers oh yesbecause you have them or do you wear them because he does” “on  contrary we shave them offbecause  seems cleaner  more comfortable” “does he wear clothesin your idea i mean” i  thinking over  pictures  god i had seenrash advances   devout mind  man representing his omnipotent deity   old man   flowing robe flowing hair flowing beard    light  her perfectly frank  innocent questions this concept seemed rather unsatisfying i explained   god   christian world  really  ancient hebrew god   we had simply taken over  patriarchal ideathat ancient one which quite inevitably clothed  thought  god   attributes   patriarchal ruler  grandfather “i see” she said eagerly after i had explained  genesis  development  our religious ideals “they lived  separate groups   male head    probably  littledomineering” “no doubt  that” i agreed “and we live together without any ‘head’   sensejust our chosen leadersthat does make  difference” “your difference  deeper than that” i assured her “it   your common motherhood your children grow up   world where everybody loves them they find life made rich  happy  them   diffused love  wisdom  all mothers so   easy  you  think  god   terms   similar diffused  competent love i think you  far nearer right than we are” “what i cannot understand” she pursued carefully “is your preservation  such  very ancient state  mind this patriarchal idea you tell me  thousands  years old” “oh yesfour five six thousandevery so many” “and you have made wonderful progress  those yearsin other things” “we certainly have but religion  different you see our religions come  behind us   initiated  some great teacher who  dead he  supposed  have known  whole thing  taught it finally all we have  do  believeand obey” “who   great hebrew teacher” “ohthere   different the hebrew religion   accumulation  extremely ancient traditions some far older than their people  grew  accretion down  ages we consider  inspired‘the word  god’” “how do you know  is” “because  says so” “does  say so   many words who wrote  in” i began  try  recall some text  did say so  could not bring   mind “apart  that” she pursued “what i cannot understand  why you keep these early religious ideas so long you have changed all your others haven’t you” “pretty generally” i agreed “but this we call ‘revealed religion’  think   final but tell me more about these little temples  yours” i urged “and these temple mothers you run to” then she gave me  extended lesson  applied religion which i  endeavor  concentrate they developed their central theory   loving power  assumed   relation  them  motherlythat  desired their welfare  especially their development their relation  it similarly  filial  loving appreciation   glad fulfillment   high purposes then being nothing if not practical they set their keen  active minds  discover  kind  conduct expected  them this worked out   most admirable system  ethics the principle  love  universally recognizedand used patience gentleness courtesy all  we call “good breeding”  part  their code  conduct but where they went far beyond us    special application  religious feeling  every field  life they had no ritual no little set  performances called “divine service” save those religious pageants i have spoken of  those   much educational  religious   much social  either but they had  clear established connection between everything they didand god their cleanliness their health their exquisite order  rich peaceful beauty   whole land  happiness   children  above all  constant progress they madeall this  their religion they applied their minds   thought  god  worked out  theory  such  inner power demanded outward expression they lived  if god  real   work within them as  those little temples everywheresome   women  more skilled more temperamentally inclined  this direction than others these whatever their work might be gave certain hours   temple service which meant being there  all their love  wisdom  trained thought  smooth out rough places  anyone who needed it sometimes    real grief very rarely  quarrel most often  perplexity even  herland  human soul had  hours  darkness but all through  country their best  wisest  ready  give help if  difficulty  unusually profound  applicant  directed  someone more specially experienced   line  thought here   religion which gave   searching mind  rational basis  life  concept   immense loving power working steadily out through them toward good it gave   “soul”  sense  contact   inmost force  perception   uttermost purpose which we always crave it gave   “heart”  blessed feeling  being loved loved  understood it gave clear simple rational directions   how we should liveand why and  ritual  gave first those triumphant group demonstrations when   union  all  arts  revivifying combination  great multitudes moved rhythmically  march  dance song  music among their own noblest products   open beauty  their groves  hills second  gave these numerous little centers  wisdom where  least wise could go   most wise   helped “it  beautiful” i cried enthusiastically “it   most practical comforting progressive religion i ever heard of you do love one anotheryou do bear one another’s burdensyou do realize   little child   type   kingdom  heaven you  more christian than any people i ever saw buthow about death and  life everlasting what does your religion teach about eternity” “nothing” said ellador “what  eternity” what indeed i tried   first time  my life  get  real hold   idea “it isnever stopping” “never stopping” she looked puzzled “yes life going  forever” “ohwe see that  course life does go  forever all about us” “but eternal life goes  without dying” “the same person” “yes  same person unending immortal” i  pleased  think  i had something  teach  our religion which theirs had never promulgated “here” asked ellador “never  diehere” i could see her practical mind heaping up  people  hurriedly reassured her “oh no indeed not herehereafter we must die here  course but then we ‘enter into eternal life’ the soul lives forever” “how do you know” she inquired “i won’t attempt  prove   you” i hastily continued “let us assume    so how does this idea strike you” again she smiled  me  adorable dimpling tender mischievous motherly smile  hers “shall i  quite quite honest” “you couldn’t  anything else” i said half gladly  half  little sorry the transparent honesty  these women   neverending astonishment  me “it seems  me  singularly foolish idea” she said calmly “and if true most disagreeable” now i had always accepted  doctrine  personal immortality   thing established the efforts  inquiring spiritualists always seeking  woo their beloved ghosts back again never seemed  me necessary i don’t say i had ever seriously  courageously discussed  subject  myself even i had simply assumed     fact and here   girl i loved this creature whose character constantly revealed new heights  ranges far beyond my own this superwoman   superland saying she thought immortality foolish she meant it too “what do you want  for” she asked “how can you not want it” i protested “do you want  go out like  candle don’t you want  go   ongrowing andandbeing happy forever” “why no” she said “i don’t   least i want my childand my child’s childto go onand they will why should i want to” “but  means heaven” i insisted “peace  beauty  comfort  lovewith god” i had never been so eloquent   subject  religion she could  horrified  damnation  question  justice  salvation but immortalitythat  surely  noble faith “why van” she said holding out her hands  me “why vandarling how splendid  you  feel  so keenly that’s what we all want  coursepeace  beauty  comfort  lovewith god and progress too remember growth always  always that  what our religion teaches us  want   work for  we do” “but   here” i said “only  this life  earth” “well and do not you  your country  your beautiful religion  love  service have  here toofor this lifeon earth” none  us  willing  tell  women  herland about  evils  our own beloved land it  all very well  us  assume them   necessary  essential   criticizestrictly among ourselvestheir alltooperfect civilization but when  came  telling them about  failures  wastes  our own we never could bring ourselves  do it moreover we sought  avoid too much discussion   press  subject  our approaching marriages jeff   determined one  this score “of course they haven’t any marriage ceremony or service but we can make   sort  quaker wedding  have    templeit   least we can do  them” it was there  so little after all  we could do  them here we were penniless guests  strangers  no chance even  use our strength  couragenothing  defend them  or protect them against “we can  least give them our names” jeff insisted they  very sweet about it quite willing  do whatever we asked  please us as   names alima frank soul  she was asked what good  would do terry always irritating her said    sign  possession “you  going   mrs nicholson”  said “mrs t o nicholson that shows everyone  you  my wife” “what   ‘wife’ exactly” she demanded  dangerous gleam  her eye “a wife   woman who belongs   man”  began but jeff took  up eagerly “and  husband   man who belongs   woman it  because we  monogamous you know and marriage   ceremony civil  religious  joins  two together‘until death do us part’”  finished looking  celis  unutterable devotion “what makes us all feel foolish” i told  girls “is  here we have nothing  give youexcept  course our names” “do your women have no names before they  married” celis suddenly demanded “why yes” jeff explained “they have their maiden namestheir father’s names  is” “and what becomes  them” asked alima “they change them  their husbands’ my dear” terry answered her “change them do  husbands then take  wives’ ‘maiden names’” “oh no”  laughed “the man keeps his own  gives   her too” “then she just loses hers  takes  new onehow unpleasant we won’t do that” alima said decidedly terry  goodhumored about it “i don’t care what you do or don’t do so long  we have  wedding pretty soon”  said reaching  strong brown hand after alima’s quite  brown  nearly  strong “as  giving us thingsof course we can see  you’d like to but we  glad you can’t” celis continued “you see we love you just  yourselveswe wouldn’t want you toto pay anything isn’t  enough  know  you  loved personallyand just  men” enough or not    way we  married we had  great triple wedding   biggest temple  all   looked  if most   nation  present it  very solemn  very beautiful someone had written  new song   occasion nobly beautiful about  new hope  their peoplethe new tie  other landsbrotherhood  well  sisterhood and  evident awe fatherhood terry  always restive under their talk  fatherhood “anybody’d think we  high priests ofof philoprogenitiveness”  protested “these women think  nothing but children seems  me we’ll teach ‘em” he  so certain  what   going  teach  alima so uncertain  her moods  reception  jeff  i feared  worst we tried  caution himmuch good  did the big handsome fellow drew himself up  his full height lifted  great chest  his  laughed “there  three separate marriages”  said “i won’t interfere  yoursnor you  mine” so  great day came   countless crowds  women  we three bridegrooms without any supporting “best men” or any other men  back us up felt strangely small  we came forward somel  zava  moadine   hand we  thankful  have them toothey seemed almost like relatives there   splendid procession wreathing dances  new anthem i spoke of   whole great place pulsed  feelingthe deep awe  sweet hope  wondering expectation   new miracle “there  been nothing like this   country since our motherhood began” somel said softly  me while we watched  symbolic marches “you see    dawn   new era you don’t know how much you mean

have never seen we hope  know themto love  help themand  learn  them ah you cannot know” thousands  voices rose   soaring climax   great hymn  the coming life by  great altar  motherhood   crown  fruit  flowers stood  new one crowned  well before  great over mother   land  her ring  high temple counsellors before  vast multitude  calmfaced mothers  holyeyed maidens came forward our own three chosen ones  we three men alone  all  land joined hands  them  made our marriage vows chapter  our difficulties we say “marriage   lottery” also “marriages  made  heaven”but this  not so widely accepted   other we have  wellfounded theory    best  marry “in one’s class”  certain wellgrounded suspicions  international marriages which seem  persist   interests  social progress rather than  those   contracting parties but no combination  alien races  color  caste or creed  ever so basically difficult  establish   between us three modern american men  these three women  herland it  all very well  say  we should have been frank about  beforehand we had been frank we had discussedat least ellador  i hadthe conditions  the great adventure  thought  path  clear before us but there  some things one takes  granted supposes  mutually understood   which both parties may repeatedly refer without ever meaning  same thing the differences   education   average man  woman  great enough but  trouble they make  not mostly   man  generally carries out his own views   case the woman may have imagined  conditions  married life   different but what she imagined  ignorant of or might have preferred did not seriously matter i can see clearly  speak calmly about this now writing after  lapse  years years full  growth  education but   time   rather hard sledding  all  usespecially  terry poor terry you see  any other imaginable marriage among  peoples   earth whether  woman  black red yellow brown or white whether she  ignorant or educated submissive or rebellious she would have behind her  marriage tradition  our general history this tradition relates  woman   man he goes   his business  she adapts herself  him   it even  citizenship  some strange hocuspocus  fact  birth  geography  waved aside   woman automatically acquired  nationality  her husband wellhere  we three aliens  this land  women it  small  area   external differences  not so great   astound us we did not yet appreciate  differences between  racemind  this people  ours in  first place they   “pure stock”  two thousand uninterrupted years where we have some long connected lines  thought  feeling together   wide range  differences often irreconcilable these people  smoothly  firmly agreed  most   basic principles  their life  not only agreed  principle but accustomed  these sixtyodd generations  act  those principles this  one thing which we did not understandhad made no allowance for when  our premarital discussions one  those dear girls had said “we understand  thus  thus” or “we hold such  such   true” we men  our own deepseated convictions   power  love  our easy views about beliefs  principles fondly imagined  we could convince them otherwise what we imagined before marriage did not matter any more than what  average innocent young girl imagines we found  facts   different it  not  they did not love us they did deeply  warmly but there  you againwhat they meant  “love”  what we meant  “love”  so different perhaps  seems rather coldblooded  say “we”  “they”  if we  not separate couples  our separate joys  sorrows but our positions  aliens drove us together constantly the whole strange experience had made our friendship more close  intimate than  would ever have become   free  easy lifetime among our own people also  men  our masculine tradition  far more than two thousand years we   unit small but firm against this far larger unit  feminine tradition i think i can make clear  points  difference without  too painful explicitness the more external disagreement    matter  “the home”   housekeeping duties  pleasures we  instinct  long education supposed   inherently appropriate  women i  give two illustrations one away up   other away down  show how completely disappointed we   this regard for  lower one try  imagine  male ant coming  some state  existence where ants live  pairs endeavoring  set up housekeeping   female ant   highly developed anthill this female ant might regard him  intense personal affection but her ideas  parentage  economic management would    very different scale  his now  course if she   stray female   country  pairing ants  might have had his way  her but if    stray male   anthill for  higher one try  imagine  devoted  impassioned man trying  set up housekeeping   lady angel  real wingsandharpandhalo angel accustomed  fulfilling divine missions all over interstellar space this angel might love  man   affection quite beyond his power  return or even  appreciation but her ideas  service  duty would    very different scale  his of course if she   stray angel   country  men  might have had his way  her but if    stray man among angels terry  his worst   black fury  which   man i must have some sympathy preferred  ant simile more  terry  his special troubles later it  hard  terry jeffwell jeff always had  streak   too good  this world he’s  kind  would have made  saintly priest  parentagearlier times he accepted  angel theory swallowed  whole tried  force   uswith varying effect he so worshipped celis  not only celis but what she represented  had become so deeply convinced   almost supernatural advantages  this country  people   took his medicine like ai cannot say “like  man” but more  if  wasn’t one don’t misunderstand me   moment dear old jeff  no milksop or mollycoddle either he   strong brave efficient man   excellent fighter when fighting  necessary but there  always this angel streak  him it  rather  wonder terry being so different   really loved jeff   did but  happens so sometimes  spite   differenceperhaps because  it as  me i stood between i  no such gay lothario  terry  no such galahad  jeff but  all my limitations i think i had  habit  using my brains  regard  behavior rather more frequently than either  them i had  use brainpower now i can tell you the big point  issue between us  our wives was  may easily  imagined   very nature   relation “wives don’t talk  me about wives” stormed terry “they don’t know what  word means” which  exactly  factthey didn’t how could they back  their prehistoric records  polygamy  slavery there  no ideals  wifehood  we know it  since then no possibility  forming such “the only thing they can think  about  man  fatherhood” said terry  high scorn “fatherhood as if  man  always wanting    father” this also  correct they had their long wide deep rich experience  motherhood  their only perception   value   male creature  such   fatherhood aside  that  course   whole range  personal love love which  jeff earnestly phrased  “passeth  love  women” it did too i can give no ideaeither now after long  happy experience  it or   seemed then   first measureless wonderof  beauty  power   love they gave us even alimawho had  more stormy temperament than either   others  who heaven knows had far more provocationeven alima  patience  tenderness  wisdom personified   man she loved until hebut i haven’t got   yet these  terry put it “alleged or socalled wives”  ours went right   their profession  foresters we having no special learnings had long since qualified  assistants we had  do something if only  pass  time   had   workwe couldn’t  playing forever this kept us out  doors  those dear girls  more or less togethertoo much together sometimes these people had  now became clear  us  highest keenest most delicate sense  personal privacy but not  faintest idea   solitude a deux we  so fond of they had every one  them  “two rooms   bath” theory realized from earliest childhood each had  separate bedroom  toilet conveniences  one   marks  coming  age   addition   outer room  which  receive friends long since we had been given our own two rooms apiece   being   different sex  race these    separate house it seemed   recognized  we should breathe easier if able  free our minds  real seclusion for food we either went  any convenient eatinghouse ordered  meal brought in or took   us   woods always  equally good all this we had become used   enjoyedin our courting days after marriage there arose  us  somewhat unexpected urge  feeling  called   separate house but this feeling found no response   hearts  those fair ladies “we are alone dear” ellador explained  me  gentle patience “we  alone  these great forests we may go  eat  any little summerhousejust we two or have  separate table anywhereor even have  separate meal  our own rooms how could we  aloner” this  all very true we had our pleasant mutual solitude about our work  our pleasant evening talks  their apartments or ours we had   were all  pleasures  courtship carried right on but we had no sense ofperhaps  may  called possession “might  well not  married  all” growled terry “they only got up  ceremony  please usplease jeff mostly they’ve no real idea  being married” i tried my best  get ellador’s point  view  naturally i tried  give her mine of course what we  men wanted  make them see   there  other   we proudly said “higher” uses  this relation than what terry called “mere parentage” in  highest terms i knew i tried  explain this  ellador “anything higher than  mutual love  hope  give life  we did” she said “how   higher” “it develops love” i explained “all  power  beautiful permanent mated love comes through this higher development” “are you sure” she asked gently “how do you know    so developed there  some birds who love each other so  they mope  pine if separated  never pair again if one dies but they never mate except   mating season among your people do you find high  lasting affection appearing  proportion  this indulgence” it   very awkward thing sometimes  have  logical mind of course i knew about those monogamous birds  beasts too  mate  life  show every sign  mutual affection without ever having stretched  sex relationship beyond  original range but what  it “those  lower forms  life” i protested “they have no capacity  faithful  affectionate  apparently happybut oh my dear my dearwhat can they know  such  love  draws us together why  touch youto  near youto come closer  closerto lose myself  yousurely you feel  too do you not” i came nearer i seized her hands her eyes   mine tender radiant but steady  strong there  something so powerful so large  changeless  those eyes  i could not sweep her off her feet  my own emotion  i had unconsciously assumed would   case it made me feel as one might imagine  man might feel who loved  goddessnot  venus though she did not resent my attitude did not repel it did not   least fear it evidently there  not  shade   timid withdrawal or pretty resistance which  soprovocative “you see dearest” she said “you have   patient  us we  not like  women  your country we  mothers  we  people but we have not specialized  this line” “we”  “we”  “we”it  so hard  get her   personal and  i thought that i suddenly remembered how we  always criticizing our women  being so personal then i did my earnest best  picture  her  sweet intense joy  married lovers   result  higher stimulus  all creative work “do you mean” she asked quite calmly  if i  not holding her cool firm hands  my hot  rather quivering ones “that  you when people marry they go right  doing this  season  out  season  no thought  children  all” “they do” i said  some bitterness “they  not mere parents they  men  women  they love each other” “how long” asked ellador rather unexpectedly “how long” i repeated  little dashed “why  long  they live” “there  something very beautiful   idea” she admitted still  if she  discussing life  mars “this climactic expression which  all  other lifeforms  but  one purpose   you become specialized  higher purer nobler uses it hasi judge  what you tell methe most ennobling effect  character people marry not only  parentage but  this exquisite interchangeand   result you have  world full  continuous lovers ardent happy mutually devoted always living   high tide  supreme emotion which we had supposed  belong only  one season  one use and you say   other results stimulating all high creative work that must mean floods oceans  such work blossoming  this intense happiness  every married pair it   beautiful idea” she  silent thinking so  i she slipped one hand free   stroking my hair     gentle motherly way i bowed my hot head  her shoulder  felt  dim sense  peace  restfulness which  very pleasant “you must take me there someday darling” she  saying “it  not only  i love you so much i want  see your countryyour peopleyour mother” she paused reverently “oh how i shall love your mother” i had not been  love many timesmy experience did not compare  terry’s but such  i had  so different  this  i  perplexed  full  mixed feelings partly  growing sense  common ground between us  pleasant rested calm feeling which i had imagined could only  attained  one way  partly  bewildered resentment because what i found  not what i had looked for it  their confounded psychology here they   this profound highly developed system  education so bred into them  even if they  not teachers  profession they all had  general proficiency  itit  second nature  them and no child stormily demanding  cookie “between meals”  ever more subtly diverted into  interest  housebuilding than  i when i found  apparently imperative demand had disappeared without my noticing it and all  time those tender mother eyes those keen scientific eyes noting every condition  circumstance  learning how  “take time   forelock”  avoid discussion before occasion arose i  amazed   results i found  much very much  what i had honestly supposed    physiological necessity   psychological necessityor so believed i found after my ideas  what  essential had changed  my feelings changed also and more than all i found thisa factor  enormous weightthese women  not provocative that made  immense difference the thing  terry had so complained  when we first camethat they weren’t “feminine” they lacked “charm” now became  great comfort their vigorous beauty   aesthetic pleasure not  irritant their dress  ornaments had not  touch   “comeandfindme” element even  my own ellador my wife who had   time unveiled  woman’s heart  faced  strange new hope  joy  dual parentage she afterward withdrew again into  same good comrade she had been  first they  women plus  so much plus  when they did not choose  let  womanness appear you could not find  anywhere i don’t say   easy  me  wasn’t but when i made appeal  her sympathies i came up against another immovable wall she  sorry honestly sorry  my distresses  made all manner  thoughtful suggestions often quite useful  well   wise foresight i have mentioned above which often saved all difficulty before  arose but her sympathy did not alter her convictions “if i thought   really right  necessary i could perhaps bring myself  it  your sake dear but i do not want tonot  all you would not have  mere submission would you that  not  kind  high romantic love you spoke of surely it   pity  course  you should have  adjust your highly specialized faculties  our unspecialized ones” confound it i hadn’t married  nation  i told her so but she only smiled  her own limitations  explained  she had  “think  we’s” confound  again here i’d have all my energies focused  one wish  before i knew  she’d have them dissipated  one direction or another some subject  discussion  began just   point i  talking about  ended miles away it must not  imagined  i  just repelled ignored left  cherish  grievance not  all my happiness    hands   larger sweeter womanhood than i had ever imagined before our marriage my own ardor had perhaps blinded me  much  this i  madly  love  not so much what  there   what i supposed   there now i found  endlessly beautiful undiscovered country  explore     sweetest wisdom  understanding it   if i had come  some new place  people   desire  eat  all hours  no other interests  particular   if my hosts instead  merely saying “you shall not eat” had presently aroused  me  lively desire  music  pictures  games  exercise  playing   water  running some ingenious machine and   multitude  my satisfactions i forgot  one point which  not satisfied  got along very well until mealtime one   cleverest  most ingenious  these tricks  only clear  me many years after when we  so wholly  one  this subject  i could laugh  my own predicament then it  this you see  us women  kept  different  possible   feminine  possible we men have our own world  only men  it we get tired  our ultramaleness  turn gladly   ultrafemaleness also  keeping our women  feminine  possible we see    when we turn  them we find  thing we want always  evidence well  atmosphere  this place  anything but seductive the very numbers  these human women always  human relation made them anything but alluring when  spite  this my hereditary instincts  racetraditions made me long   feminine response  ellador instead  withdrawing so  i should want her more she deliberately gave me  little too much  her societyalways defeminized   were it  awfully funny really here  i   ideal  mind  which i hotly longed  here  she deliberately obtruding   foreground  my consciousness  facta fact which i coolly enjoyed but which actually interfered  what i wanted i see now clearly enough why  certain kind  man like sir almroth wright resents  professional development  women it gets   way   sex ideal  temporarily covers  excludes femininity of course  this case i  so fond  ellador my friend  ellador my professional companion  i necessarily enjoyed her society  any terms onlywhen i had had her  me  her defeminine capacity   sixteenhour day i could go  my own room  sleep without dreaming about her the witch if ever anybody worked  woo  win  hold  human soul she did great superwoman  she was i couldn’t then half comprehend  skill  it  wonder but this i soon began  find  under all our cultivated attitude  mind toward women there   older deeper more “natural” feeling  restful reverence which looks up   mother sex so we grew together  friendship  happiness ellador  i  so did jeff  celis when  comes  terry’s part  it  alima’s i’m sorryand i’m ashamed of course i blame her somewhat she wasn’t  fine  psychologist  ellador  what’s more i think she had  fardescended atavistic trace  more marked femaleness never apparent till terry called  out but when all  said  doesn’t excuse him i hadn’t realized   full terry’s characteri couldn’t being  man the position   same   us  course only  these distinctions alima  shade more alluring  several shades less able   practical psychologist terry  hundredfold more demandingand proportionately less reasonable things grew strained very soon between them i fancy  first when they  together  her great hope  parentage  his keen joy  conquestthat terry  inconsiderate in fact i know it  things  said “you needn’t talk  me”  snapped  jeff one day just before our weddings “there never   woman yet  did not enjoy being mastered all your pretty talk doesn’t amount   hill o’beansi know” and terry would hum i’ve taken my fun where i found it i’ve rogued  i’ve ranged  my time  the things  i learned   yellow  black they ‘ave helped me  ‘eap   white jeff turned sharply  left him   time i   bit disquieted myself poor old terry the things he’d learned didn’t help him  heap  herland his idea   takehe thought    way he thought  honestly believed  women like it not  women  herland not alima i can see her nowone day   very first week  their marriage setting forth  her day’s work  long determined strides  hardset mouth  sticking close  ellador she didn’t wish   alone  terryyou could see that but  more she kept away  him  more  wanted hernaturally he made  tremendous row about their separate establishments tried  keep her  his rooms tried  stay  hers but there she drew  line sharply he came away one night  stamped up  down  moonlit road swearing under his breath i  taking  walk  night too but i wasn’t  his state  mind to hear him rage you’d not have believed   loved alima  allyou’d have thought  she  some quarry   pursuing something  catch  conquer i think that owing  all those differences i spoke of they soon lost  common ground they had  first   unable  meet sanely  dispassionately i fancy toothis  pure conjecturethat  had succeeded  driving alima beyond her best judgment her real conscience   after  her own sense  shame  reaction   thing made her bitter perhaps they quarreled really quarreled  after making  up once or twice they seemed  come   real breakshe would not  alone  him  all and perhaps she   bit nervous i don’t know but she got moadine  come  stay next door  her also she had  sturdy assistant detailed  accompany her  her work terry had his own ideas  i’ve tried  show i daresay  thought  had  right  do   did perhaps  even convinced himself   would  better  her anyhow  hid himself  her bedroom one night the women  herland have no fear  men why should they have they  not timid  any sense they  not weak  they all have strong trained athletic bodies othello could not have extinguished alima   pillow  if she   mouse terry put  practice his pet conviction   woman loves   mastered   sheer brute force  all  pride  passion  his intense masculinity  tried  master this woman it did not work i got  pretty clear account   later  ellador but what we heard   time   noise   tremendous struggle  alima calling  moadine moadine  close   came  once one or two more strong grave women followed terry dashed about like  madman  would cheerfully have killed themhe told me that himselfbut  couldn’t when  swung  chair over his head one sprang   air  caught it two threw themselves bodily upon him  forced him   floor   only  work   few moments  have him tied hand  foot  then  sheer pity  his futile rage  anesthetize him alima    cold fury she wanted him killedactually there   trial before  local over mother  this woman who did not enjoy being mastered stated her case in  court  our country  would have been held quite “within his rights”  course but this  not our country   theirs they seemed  measure  enormity   offense   effect upon  possible fatherhood   scorned even  reply  this way  putting it he did let himself go once  explained  definite terms  they  incapable  understanding  man’s needs  man’s desires  man’s point  view he called them neuters epicenes bloodless sexless creatures he said they could  course kill himas so many insects couldbut   despised them nonetheless and all those stern grave mothers did not seem  mind his despising them not   least it   long trial  many interesting points  brought out   their views  our habits  after  while terry had his sentence he waited grim  defiant the sentence was “you must go home” chapter  expelled we had all meant  go home again indeed we had not meantnot  any meansto stay  long  we had but when  came  being turned out dismissed sent away  bad conduct we none  us really liked it terry said  did he professed great scorn   penalty   trial  well  all  other characteristics  “this miserable halfcountry” but  knew  we knew   any “whole” country we should never have been  forgivingly treated  we had been here “if  people had come after us according   directions we left there’d have been quite  different story” said terry we found out later why no reserve party had arrived all our careful directions had been destroyed   fire we might have all died there  no one  home have ever known our whereabouts terry  under guard now all  time known  unsafe convicted  what   them  unpardonable sin he laughed  their chill horror “parcel  old maids”  called them “they’re all old maidschildren or not they don’t know  first thing about sex” when terry said sex sex   very large s  meant  male sex naturally  special values  profound conviction  being “the life force”  cheerful ignoring   true life process   interpretation   other sex solely   own point  view i had learned  see these things very differently since living  ellador    jeff   so thoroughly herlandized   wasn’t fair  terry who fretted sharply  his new restraint moadine grave  strong  sadly patient   mother   degenerate child kept steady watch  him  enough other women close  hand  prevent  outbreak he had no weapons  well knew  all his strength   small avail against those grim quiet women we  allowed  visit him freely but  had only his room   small highwalled garden  walk in while  preparations  our departure  under way three  us   go terry because  must i because two  safer  our flyer   long boat trip   coast ellador because she would not let me go without her if jeff had elected  return celis would have gone toothey   most absorbed  lovers but jeff had no desire  way “why should i want  go back  all our noise  dirt our vice  crime our disease  degeneracy”  demanded  me privately we never spoke like  before  women “i wouldn’t take celis there  anything  earth”  protested “she’d die she’d die  horror  shame  see our slums  hospitals how can you risk   ellador you’d better break   her gently before she really makes up her mind” jeff  right i ought  have told her more fully than i did  all  things we had   ashamed of but   very hard  bridge  gulf   deep  difference  existed between our life  theirs i tried to “look here my dear” i said  her “if you  really going  my country  me you’ve got   prepared   good many shocks it’s not  beautiful  thisthe cities i mean  civilized partsof course  wild country is” “i shall enjoy  all” she said her eyes starry  hope “i understand it’s not like ours i can see how monotonous our quiet life must seem  you how much more stirring yours must be it must  like  biological change you told me about when  second sex  introduceda far greater movement constant change  new possibilities  growth” i had told her   later biological theories  sex  she  deeply convinced   superior advantages  having two  superiority   world  men  it “we have done what we could alone perhaps we have some things better   quiet way but you have  whole worldall  people   different nationsall  long rich history behind youall  wonderful new knowledge oh i just can’t wait  see it” what could i do i told her  so many words  we had our unsolved problems  we had dishonesty  corruption vice  crime disease  insanity prisons  hospitals   made no more impression  her than  would  tell  south sea islander about  temperature   arctic circle she could intellectually see    bad  have those things but she could not feel it we had quite easily come  accept  herland life  normal because   normalnone  us make any outcry over mere health  peace  happy industry and  abnormal  which we  all so sadly well acclimated she had never seen the two things she cared most  hear about  wanted most  see  these  beautiful relation  marriage   lovely women who  mothers  nothing else beyond these her keen active mind hungered eagerly   world life “i’m almost  anxious  go  you  yourself” she insisted “and you must  desperately homesick” i assured her  no one could  homesick  such  paradise  theirs but she would have none  it “oh yesi know it’s like those little tropical islands you’ve told me about shining like jewels   big blue seai can’t wait  see  sea the little island may   perfect   garden but you always want  get back  your own big country don’t you even if   bad  some ways” ellador  more than willing but  nearer  came  our really going   my having  take her back  our “civilization” after  clean peace  beauty  theirs  more i began  dread it   more i tried  explain of course i had been homesick  first while we  prisoners before i had ellador and  course i had  first rather idealized my country   ways  describing it also i had always accepted certain evils  integral parts  our civilization  never dwelt  them  all even when i tried  tell her  worst i never remembered some thingswhich when she came  see them impressed her  once  they had never impressed me now  my efforts  explanation i began  see both ways more keenly than i had before  see  painful defects  my own land  marvelous gains  this in missing men we three visitors had naturally missed  larger part  life  had unconsciously assumed  they must miss  too it took me  long time  realizeterry never did realizehow little  meant  them when we say men man manly manhood  all  other masculine derivatives we have   background  our minds  huge vague crowded picture   world  all  activities to grow up  “be  man”  “act like  man”the meaning  connotation  wide indeed that vast background  full  marching columns  men  changing lines  men  long processions  men  men steering their ships into new seas exploring unknown mountains breaking horses herding cattle ploughing  sowing  reaping toiling   forge  furnace digging   mine building roads  bridges  high cathedrals managing great businesses teaching  all  colleges preaching  all  churches  men everywhere doing everything“the world” and when we say women we think femalethe sex but  these women   unbroken sweep  this twothousandyearold feminine civilization  word woman called up all  big background so far  they had gone  social development   word man meant  them only malethe sex of course we could tell them   our world men did everything but  did not alter  background  their minds that man “the male” did all these things   them  statement making no more change   point  view than  made  ours when we first faced  astounding factto usthat  herland women  “the world” we had been living there more than  year we had learned their limited history   straight smooth upreaching lines reaching higher  going faster up   smooth comfort  their present life we had learned  little  their psychology  much wider field than  history but here we could not follow so readily we  now well used  seeing women not  females but  people people  all sorts doing every kind  work this outbreak  terry’s   strong reaction against it gave us  new light  their genuine femininity this  given me  great clearness  both ellador  somel the feeling   samesick revulsion  horror such  would  felt  some climactic blasphemy they had no faintest approach  such  thing  their minds knowing nothing   custom  marital indulgence among us to them  one high purpose  motherhood had been  so long  governing law  life   contribution   father though known  them so distinctly another method   same end  they could not  all their effort get  point  view   male creature whose desires quite ignore parentage  seek only  what we euphoniously term “the joys  love” when i tried  tell ellador  women too felt so  us she drew away  me  tried hard  grasp intellectually what she could  no way sympathize with “you meanthat  youlove between man  woman expresses itself   waywithout regard  motherhood to parentage i mean” she added carefully “yes surely it  love we think ofthe deep sweet love between two of course we want children  children comebut   not what we think about” “butbutit seems so against nature” she said “none   creatures we know do that do other animalsin your country” “we  not animals” i replied  some sharpness “at least we  something moresomething higher this   far nobler  more beautiful relation  i have explained before your view seems  us rathershall i say practical prosaic merely  means   end with usoh my dear girlcannot you see cannot you feel it   last sweetest highest consummation  mutual love” she  impressed visibly she trembled  my arms  i held her close kissing her hungrily but there rose  her eyes  look i knew so well  remote clear look  if she had gone far away even though i held her beautiful body so close   now  some snowy mountain regarding me   distance “i feel  quite clearly” she said  me “it gives me  deep sympathy  what you feel no doubt more strongly still but what i feel even what you feel dearest does not convince me    right until i am sure  that  course i cannot do  you wish” ellador  times like this always reminded me  epictetus “i  put you  prison” said his master “my body you mean” replied epictetus calmly “i  cut your head off” said his master “have i said  my head could not  cut off” a difficult person epictetus what  this miracle  which  woman even  your arms may withdraw herself utterly disappear till what you hold   inaccessible   face   cliff “be patient  me dear” she urged sweetly “i know   hard  you and i begin  seea littlehow terry  so driven  crime” “oh come that’s  pretty hard word  it after all alima  his wife you know” i urged feeling   moment  sudden burst  sympathy  poor terry for  man  his temperamentand habitsit must have been  unbearable situation but ellador  all her wide intellectual grasp   broad sympathy  which their religion trained them could not make allowance  suchto hersacrilegious brutality it   more difficult  explain  her because we three  our constant talks  lectures about  rest   world had naturally avoided  seamy side not so much   desire  deceive but  wishing  put  best foot foremost  our civilization   face   beauty  comfort  theirs also we really thought some things  right or  least unavoidable which we could readily see would  repugnant  them  therefore did not discuss again there  much  our world’s life which we being used  it had not noticed  anything worth describing and still further there  about these women  colossal innocence upon which many   things we did say had made no impression whatever i am thus explicit about  because  shows how unexpectedly strong   impression made upon ellador when she  last entered our civilization she urged me   patient  i  patient you see i loved her so much  even  restrictions she so firmly established left me much happiness we  lovers  there  surely delight enough  that do not imagine  these young women utterly refused “the great new hope”  they called it   dual parentage for  they had agreed  marry us though  marrying part     concession  our prejudices rather than theirs to them  process   holy thingand they meant  keep  holy but so far only celis her blue eyes swimming  happy tears her heart lifted   tide  racemotherhood which  their supreme passion could  ineffable joy  pride announce  she     mother “the new motherhood” they called it   whole country knew there  no pleasure no service no honor  all  land  celis might not have had almost like  breathless reverence  which two thousand years ago  dwindling band  women had watched  miracle  virgin birth   deep awe  warm expectancy  which they greeted this new miracle  union all mothers   land  holy to them  long ages  approach  motherhood  been   most intense  exquisite love  longing   supreme desire  overmastering demand   child every thought they held  connection   processes  maternity  open   day simple yet sacred every woman  them placed motherhood not only higher than other duties but so far higher  there  no other duties one might almost say all their wide mutual love all  subtle interplay  mutual friendship  service  urge  progressive thought  invention  deepest religious emotion every feeling  every act  related  this great central power   river  life pouring through them which made them  bearers   very spirit  god of all this i learned more  morefrom their books  talk especially  ellador she   first   brief moment envious  her frienda thought she put away  her  once  forever “it  better” she said  me “it  much better    not come  me yetto us  is for if i am  go  you  your country we may have ‘adventures  sea  land’  you say and   truth we did   might not   all safe   baby so we won’t try again dear till   safewill we” this   hard saying   very loving husband “unless” she went on “if one  coming you  leave me behind you can come back you knowand i shall have  child” then  deep ancient chill  male jealousy  even his own progeny touched my heart “i’d rather have you ellador than all  children   world i’d rather have you  meon your own termsthan not  have you” this   very stupid saying of course i would for if she wasn’t there i should want all  her  have none  her but if she went along   sort  sublimated sisteronly much closer  warmer than that reallywhy i should have all  her but  one thing and i  beginning  find  ellador’s friendship ellador’s comradeship ellador’s sisterly affection ellador’s perfectly sincere lovenone  less deep  she held  back   definite line  reservewere enough  live  very happily i find  quite beyond me  describe what this woman   me we talk fine things about women but  our hearts we know  they  very limited beingsmost  them we honor them  their functional powers even while we dishonor them  our use  it we honor them  their carefully enforced virtue even while we show  our own conduct how little we think   virtue we value them sincerely   perverted maternal activities which make our wives  most comfortable  servants bound  us  life   wages wholly  our own decision their whole business outside   temporary duties  such motherhood  they may achieve  meet our needs  every way oh we value them all right “in their place” which place   home where they perform  mixture  duties so ably described  mrs josephine dodge daskam bacon  which  services  “a mistress”  carefully specified she   very clear writer mrs j d d bacon  understands her subjectfrom her own point  view butthat combination  industries while convenient    way economical does not arouse  kind  emotion commanded   women  herland these  women one had  love “up” very high up instead  down they  not pets they  not servants they  not timid inexperienced weak after i got over  jar  my pride which jeff i truly think never felthe   born worshipper  which terry never got overhe  quite clear  his ideas  “the position  women” i found  loving “up”   very good sensation after all it gave me  queer feeling way down deep    stirring  some ancient dim prehistoric consciousness  feeling  they  right somehowthat this   way  feel it  likecoming home  mother i don’t mean  underflannelsanddoughnuts mother  fussy person  waits  you  spoils you  doesn’t really know you i mean  feeling   very little child would have who had been lostfor ever so long it   sense  getting home  being clean  rested  safety  yet freedom  love   always there warm like sunshine  may not hot like  stove or  featherbeda love  didn’t irritate  didn’t smother i looked  ellador  if i hadn’t seen her before “if you won’t go” i said “i’ll get terry   coast  come back alone you can let me down  rope and if you  gowhy you blessed wonderwomani would rather live  you all my lifelike thisthan  have any other woman i ever saw or any number  them  do  i like with will you come” she  keen  coming so  plans went on she’d have liked  wait   marvel  celis’s but terry had no such desire he  crazy   out   all it made him sick  said sick this everlasting mothermothermothering i don’t think terry had what  phrenologists call “the lump  philoprogenitiveness”  all well developed “morbid onesided cripples”  called them even when  his window  could see their splendid vigor  beauty even while moadine  patient  friendly  if she had never helped alima  hold  bind him sat there   room  picture  wisdom  serene strength “sexless epicene undeveloped neuters”  went  bitterly he sounded like sir almwroth wright wellit  hard he  madly  love  alima really more so than  had ever been before  their tempestuous courtship quarrels  reconciliations had fanned  flame and then when  sought   supreme conquest which seems so natural  thing   type  man  force her  love him  her masterto have  sturdy athletic furious woman rise up  master himshe  her friendsit  no wonder  raged come  think  it i do not recall  similar case  all history or fiction women have killed themselves rather than submit  outrage they have killed  outrager they have escaped or they have submittedsometimes seeming  get  very well   victor afterward there   adventure  “false sextus”  instance who “found lucrese combing  fleece under  midnight lamp” he threatened  i remember  if she did not submit  would slay her slay  slave  place him beside her  say  found him there a poor device  always seemed  me if mr lucretius had asked him how  came    his wife’s bedroom overlooking her morals what could  have said but  point  lucrese submitted  alima didn’t “she kicked me” confided  embittered prisonerhe had  talk  someone “i  doubled up   pain  course  she jumped  me  yelled  this old harpy moadine couldn’t hear him  they had me trussed up  no time i believe alima could have done  alone”  added  reluctant admiration “she’s  strong   horse and  course  man’s helpless when you hit him like that no woman   shade  decency” i had  grin  that  even terry did sourly he wasn’t given  reasoning but  did strike him   assault like his rather waived considerations  decency “i’d give  year  my life  have her alone again”  said slowly his hands clenched till  knuckles  white but  never did she left our end   country entirely went up into  firforest   highest slopes  stayed there before we left  quite desperately longed  see her but she would not come   could not go they watched him like lynxes do lynxes watch any better than mousing cats i wonder wellwe had  get  flyer  order   sure there  enough fuel left though terry said we could glide all right down   lake once we got started we’d have gone gladly   week’s time  course but there   great todo all over  country about ellador’s leaving them she had interviews  some   leading ethicistswise women  still eyes    best   teachers there   stir  thrill  deep excitement everywhere our teaching about  rest   world  given them all  sense  isolation  remoteness  being  little outlying sample   country overlooked  forgotten among  family  nations we had called  “the family  nations”  they liked  phrase immensely they  deeply aroused   subject  evolution indeed  whole field  natural science drew them irresistibly any number  them would have risked everything  go   strange unknown lands  study but we could take only one   had   ellador naturally we planned greatly about coming back about establishing  connecting route  water about penetrating those vast forests  civilizingor exterminatingthe dangerous savages that is we men talked   lastnot   women they had  definite aversion  killing things but meanwhile there  high council being held among  wisest  them all the students  thinkers who had been gathering facts  us all this time collating  relating them  making inferences laid  result  their labors before  council little had we thought  our careful efforts  concealment had been so easily seen through  never  word  show us  they saw they had followed up words  ours   science  optics asked innocent questions about glasses   like   aware   defective eyesight so common among us with  lightest touch different women asking different questions  different times  putting all our answers together like  picture puzzle they had figured out  sort  skeleton chart    prevalence  disease among us even more subtly  no show  horror or condemnation they had gathered somethingfar   truth but something pretty clearabout poverty vice  crime they even had  goodly number  our dangers all itemized  asking us about insurance  innocent things like that they  well posted    different races beginning  their poisonarrow natives down below  widening out   broad racial divisions we had told them about never  shocked expression   face or exclamation  revolt had warned us they had been extracting  evidence without our knowing  all this time  now  studying   most devout earnestness  matter they had prepared the result  rather distressing  us they first explained  matter fully  ellador  she   one who purposed visiting  rest   world to celis they said nothing she must not   any way distressed while  whole nation waited  her great work finally jeff  i  called in somel  zava  there  ellador  many others  we knew they had  great globe quite fairly mapped out   small section maps   compendium  ours they had  different peoples   earth roughly outlined  their status  civilization indicated they had charts  figures  estimates based   facts   traitorous little book  what they had learned  us somel explained “we find   all your historic period so much longer than ours   all  interplay  services  exchange  inventions  discoveries   wonderful progress we so admire   this widespread other world  yours there  still much disease often contagious” we admitted this  once “also there  still  varying degree ignorance  prejudice  unbridled emotion” this too  admitted “we find also   spite   advance  democracy   increase  wealth  there  still unrest  sometimes combat” yes yes we admitted  all we  used  these things  saw no reason  so much seriousness “all things considered” they said  they did not say  hundredth part   things they  considering “we  unwilling  expose our country  free communication   rest   worldas yet if ellador comes back  we approve her report  may  done laterbut not yet “so we have this  ask  you gentlemen they knew  word  held  title  honor  us  you promise not  any way  betray  location  this country until permissionafter ellador’s return” jeff  perfectly satisfied he thought they  quite right he always did i never saw  alien become naturalized more quickly than  man  herland i studied  awhile thinking   time they’d have if some  our contagions got loose there  concluded they  right so i agreed terry   obstacle “indeed i won’t”  protested “the first thing i’ll do   get  expedition fixed up  force  entrance into maland” “then” they said quite calmly “he must remain  absolute prisoner always” “anesthesia would  kinder” urged moadine “and safer” added zava “he  promise i think” said ellador and  did with which agreement we  last left herland end  project gutenberg’s herland  charlotte perkins stetson gilman
