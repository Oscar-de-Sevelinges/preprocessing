eight fits  lewis carroll preface ifand  thing  wildly possiblethe charge  writing nonsense  ever brought against  author  this brief but instructive poem  would  based i feel convinced   line in p “then  bowsprit got mixed   rudder sometimes” in view  this painful possibility i  not as i might appeal indignantly  my other writings   proof  i am incapable  such  deed i  not as i might point   strong moral purpose  this poem itself   arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated  it or   noble teachings  natural historyi  take  more prosaic course  simply explaining how  happened the bellman who  almost morbidly sensitive about appearances used  have  bowsprit unshipped once or twice  week   revarnished   more than once happened when  time came  replacing it  no one  board could remember which end   ship  belonged to they knew   not   slightest use  appeal   bellman about ithe would only refer  his naval code  read out  pathetic tones admiralty instructions which none  them had ever been able  understandso  generally ended   being fastened on anyhow across  rudder the helmsman used  stand   tears  his eyes  knew   all wrong but alas rule    code “no one shall speak   man   helm” had been completed   bellman himself   words “and  man   helm shall speak  no one” so remonstrance  impossible  no steering could  done till  next varnishing day during these bewildering intervals  ship usually sailed backwards as this poem   some extent connected   lay   jabberwock let me take this opportunity  answering  question   often been asked me how  pronounce “slithy toves” the “i”  “slithy”  long   “writhe”  “toves”  pronounced so   rhyme  “groves” again  first “o”  “borogoves”  pronounced like  “o”  “borrow” i have heard people try  give   sound   “o”  “worry” such  human perversity this also seems  fitting occasion  notice  other hard words   poem humptydumpty’s theory  two meanings packed into one word like  portmanteau seems  me  right explanation  all for instance take  two words “fuming”  “furious” make up your mind  you  say both words but leave  unsettled which you  first now open your mouth  speak if your thoughts incline ever so little towards “fuming” you  say “fumingfurious” if they turn  even  hair’s breadth towards “furious” you  say “furiousfuming” but if you have  rarest  gifts  perfectly balanced mind you  say “frumious” supposing that when pistol uttered  wellknown words “under which king bezonian speak or die” justice shallow had felt certain    either william or richard but had not been able  settle which so   could not possibly say either name before  other can   doubted that rather than die  would have gasped out “rilchiam” fit  first the landing “just  place   snark”  bellman cried as  landed his crew  care supporting each man   top   tide by  finger entwined  his hair “just  place   snark i have said  twice that alone should encourage  crew just  place   snark i have said  thrice what i tell you three times  true” the crew  complete  included  boots a maker  bonnets  hoods a barrister brought  arrange their disputes and  broker  value their goods a billiardmarker whose skill  immense might perhaps have won more than his share but  banker engaged  enormous expense had  whole  their cash  his care there  also  beaver  paced   deck or would sit making lace   bow and had often the bellman said saved them  wreck though none   sailors knew how there  one who  famed   number  things he forgot when  entered  ship his umbrella his watch all his jewels  rings and  clothes  had bought   trip he had fortytwo boxes all carefully packed with his name painted clearly  each but since  omitted  mention  fact they  all left behind   beach the loss  his clothes hardly mattered because he had seven coats  when  came with three pairs  bootsbut  worst   was he had wholly forgotten his name he would answer  “hi” or  any loud cry such  “fry me” or “fritter my wig” to “whatyoumaycallum” or “whatwashisname” but especially “thingumajig” while  those who preferred  more forcible word he had different names  these his intimate friends called him “candleends” and his enemies “toastedcheese” “his form  ungainlyhis intellect small” so  bellman would often remark “but his courage  perfect and that after all is  thing  one needs   snark” he would joke  hyenas returning their stare with  impudent wag   head and  once went  walk pawinpaw   bear “just  keep up  spirits”  said he came   baker but owned when too late and  drove  poor bellman halfmad he could only bake bridecakefor which i may state no materials    had the last   crew needs especial remark though  looked  incredible dunce he had just one ideabut  one being “snark” the good bellman engaged him  once he came   butcher but gravely declared when  ship had been sailing  week he could only kill beavers the bellman looked scared and  almost too frightened  speak but  length  explained   tremulous tone there  only one beaver  board and    tame one  had  his own whose death would  deeply deplored the beaver who happened  hear  remark protested  tears   eyes that not even  rapture  hunting  snark could atone   dismal surprise it strongly advised   butcher should  conveyed   separate ship but  bellman declared  would never agree with  plans  had made   trip navigation  always  difficult art though  only one ship  one bell and  feared  must really decline  his part undertaking another  well the beaver’s best course was no doubt  procure a secondhand daggerproof coat so  baker advised itand next  insure its life  some office  note this  banker suggested  offered  hire on moderate terms or  sale two excellent policies one against fire and one against damage from hail yet still ever after  sorrowful day whenever  butcher  by the beaver kept looking  opposite way and appeared unaccountably shy fit  second the bellman’s speech the bellman himself they all praised   skies such  carriage such ease  such grace such solemnity too one could see   wise the moment one looked  his face he had bought  large map representing  sea without  least vestige  land and  crew  much pleased when they found    a map they could all understand “what’s  good  mercator’s north poles  equators tropics zones  meridian lines” so  bellman would cry   crew would reply “they  merely conventional signs “other maps  such shapes  their islands  capes but we’ve got our brave captain  thank” so  crew would protest “that he’s bought us  best a perfect  absolute blank” this  charming no doubt but they shortly found out that  captain they trusted so well had only one notion  crossing  ocean and    tingle his bell he  thoughtful  gravebut  orders  gave were enough  bewilder  crew when  cried “steer  starboard but keep her head larboard” what  earth   helmsman  do then  bowsprit got mixed   rudder sometimes a thing   bellman remarked that frequently happens  tropical climes when  vessel is so  speak “snarked” but  principal failing occurred   sailing and  bellman perplexed  distressed said  had hoped  least when  wind blew due east that  ship would not travel due west but  danger  pastthey had landed  last with their boxes portmanteaus  bags yet  first sight  crew  not pleased   view which consisted  chasms  crags the bellman perceived  their spirits  low and repeated  musical tone some jokes  had kept   season  woe but  crew would do nothing but groan he served out some grog   liberal hand and bade them sit down   beach and they could not but own  their captain looked grand as  stood  delivered his speech “friends romans  countrymen lend me your ears” they  all  them fond  quotations so they drank  his health  they gave him three cheers while  served out additional rations “we have sailed many months we have sailed many weeks four weeks   month you may mark but never  yet ‘tis your captain who speaks have we caught  least glimpse   snark “we have sailed many weeks we have sailed many days seven days   week i allow but  snark   which we might lovingly gaze we have never beheld till now “come listen my men while i tell you again the five unmistakable marks by which you may know wheresoever you go the warranted genuine snarks “let us take them  order the first   taste which  meagre  hollow but crisp like  coat   rather too tight   waist with  flavour  willo’thewisp “its habit  getting up late you’ll agree that  carries too far when i say that  frequently breakfasts  fiveo’clock tea and dines   following day “the third   slowness  taking  jest should you happen  venture  one it  sigh like  thing   deeply distressed and  always looks grave   pun “the fourth   fondness  bathingmachines which  constantly carries about and believes  they add   beauty  scenes a sentiment open  doubt “the fifth  ambition it next   right to describe each particular batch distinguishing those  have feathers  bite and those  have whiskers  scratch “for although common snarks do no manner  harm yet i feel  my duty  say some  boojums” the bellman broke off  alarm for  baker had fainted away fit  third the baker’s tale they roused him  muffinsthey roused him  ice they roused him  mustard  cress they roused him  jam  judicious advice they set him conundrums  guess when  length  sat up   able  speak his sad story  offered  tell and  bellman cried “silence not even  shriek” and excitedly tingled his bell there  silence supreme not  shriek not  scream scarcely even  howl or  groan as  man they called “ho” told his story  woe in  antediluvian tone “my father  mother  honest though poor” “skip all that” cried  bellman  haste “if  once becomes dark there’s no chance   snark we have hardly  minute  waste” “i skip forty years” said  baker  tears “and proceed without further remark to  day when you took me aboard  your ship to help you  hunting  snark “a dear uncle  mine after whom i  named remarked when i bade him farewell” “oh skip your dear uncle”  bellman exclaimed as  angrily tingled his bell “he remarked  me then” said  mildest  men “‘if your snark   snark   right fetch  home  all meansyou may serve   greens and it’s handy  striking  light “‘you may seek   thimblesand seek   care you may hunt   forks  hope you may threaten  life   railwayshare you may charm   smiles  soap’” “that’s exactly  method”  bellman bold in  hasty parenthesis cried “that’s exactly  way i have always been told that  capture  snarks should  tried” “‘but oh beamish nephew beware   day if your snark   boojum for then you  softly  suddenly vanish away and never  met  again’ “it  this   this  oppresses my soul when i think  my uncle’s last words and my heart  like nothing so much   bowl brimming over  quivering curds “it  this   this” “we have had  before” the bellman indignantly said and  baker replied “let me say  once more it  this   this  i dread “i engage   snarkevery night after dark in  dreamy delirious fight i serve   greens  those shadowy scenes and i use   striking  light “but if ever i meet   boojum  day in  moment of this i am sure i shall softly  suddenly vanish away and  notion i cannot endure” fit  fourth the hunting the bellman looked huffish  wrinkled his brow “if only you’d spoken before it’s excessively awkward  mention  now with  snark so  speak   door “we should all  us grieve  you well may believe if you never  met  again but surely my man when  voyage began you might have suggested  then “it’s excessively awkward  mention  now as i think i’ve already remarked” and  man they called “hi” replied   sigh “i informed you  day we embarked “you may charge me  murderor want  sense we  all  us weak  times but  slightest approach   false pretence was never among my crimes “i said   hebrewi said   dutch i said   german  greek but i wholly forgot and  vexes me much that english  what you speak” “‘tis  pitiful tale” said  bellman whose face had grown longer  every word “but now  you’ve stated  whole  your case more debate would  simply absurd “the rest  my speech” he explained  his men “you shall hear when i’ve leisure  speak it but  snark   hand let me tell you again ‘tis your glorious duty  seek it “to seek   thimbles  seek   care to pursue   forks  hope to threaten  life   railwayshare to charm   smiles  soap “for  snark’s  peculiar creature  won’t be caught   commonplace way do all  you know  try all  you don’t not  chance must  wasted today “for england expectsi forbear  proceed ‘tis  maxim tremendous but trite and you’d best  unpacking  things  you need to rig yourselves out   fight” then  banker endorsed  blank cheque which  crossed and changed his loose silver  notes the baker  care combed his whiskers  hair and shook  dust out  his coats the boots   broker  sharpening  spade each working  grindstone  turn but  beaver went  making lace  displayed no interest   concern though  barrister tried  appeal   pride and vainly proceeded  cite a number  cases  which making laces had been proved  infringement  right the maker  bonnets ferociously planned a novel arrangement  bows while  billiardmarker  quivering hand was chalking  tip  his nose but  butcher turned nervous  dressed himself fine with yellow kid gloves   ruff said  felt  exactly like going  dine which  bellman declared  all “stuff” “introduce me now there’s  good fellow”  said “if we happen  meet  together” and  bellman sagaciously nodding his head said “that must depend   weather” the beaver went simply galumphing about at seeing  butcher so shy and even  baker though stupid  stout made  effort  wink  one eye “be  man” said  bellman  wrath   heard the butcher beginning  sob “should we meet   jubjub  desperate bird we shall need all our strength   job” fit  fifth the beaver’s lesson they sought   thimbles they sought   care they pursued   forks  hope they threatened  life   railwayshare they charmed   smiles  soap then  butcher contrived  ingenious plan for making  separate sally and had fixed   spot unfrequented  man a dismal  desolate valley but  very same plan   beaver occurred it had chosen  very same place yet neither betrayed   sign or  word the disgust  appeared  his face each thought   thinking  nothing but “snark” and  glorious work   day and each tried  pretend   did not remark that  other  going  way but  valley grew narrow  narrower still and  evening got darker  colder till merely  nervousness not  goodwill they marched along shoulder  shoulder then  scream shrill  high rent  shuddering sky and they knew  some danger  near the beaver turned pale   tip   tail and even  butcher felt queer he thought  his childhood left far far behind that blissful  innocent state the sound so exactly recalled  his mind a pencil  squeaks   slate “‘tis  voice   jubjub”  suddenly cried this man  they used  call “dunce” “as  bellman would tell you”  added  pride “i have uttered  sentiment once “‘tis  note   jubjub keep count i entreat you  find i have told  you twice ‘tis  song   jubjub the proof  complete if only i’ve stated  thrice” the beaver had counted  scrupulous care attending  every word but  fairly lost heart  outgrabe  despair when  third repetition occurred it felt that  spite  all possible pains it had somehow contrived  lose count and  only thing now   rack  poor brains by reckoning up  amount “two added  oneif  could but  done” it said “with one’s fingers  thumbs” recollecting  tears how  earlier years it had taken no pains   sums “the thing can  done” said  butcher “i think the thing must  done i am sure the thing shall  done bring me paper  ink the best there  time  procure” the beaver brought paper portfolio pens and ink  unfailing supplies while strange creepy creatures came out  their dens and watched them  wondering eyes so engrossed   butcher  heeded them not as  wrote   pen  each hand and explained all  while   popular style which  beaver could well understand “taking three   subject  reason about a convenient number  state we add seven  ten  then multiply out by one thousand diminished  eight “the result we proceed  divide  you see by nine hundred  ninety two then subtract seventeen   answer must  exactly  perfectly true “the method employed i would gladly explain while i have  so clear  my head if i had but  time  you had but  brain but much yet remains   said “in one moment i’ve seen what  hitherto been enveloped  absolute mystery and without extra charge i  give you  large a lesson  natural history” in his genial way  proceeded  say forgetting all laws  propriety and  giving instruction without introduction would have caused quite  thrill  society “as  temper  jubjub’s  desperate bird since  lives  perpetual passion its taste  costume  entirely absurd it  ages ahead   fashion “but  knows any friend   met once before it never  look   bribe and  charitymeetings  stands   door and collectsthough  does not subscribe “its’ flavour when cooked  more exquisite far than mutton or oysters or eggs some think  keeps best   ivory jar and some  mahogany kegs “you boil   sawdust you salt   glue you condense   locusts  tape still keeping one principal object  view to preserve  symmetrical shape” the butcher would gladly have talked till next day but  felt   lesson must end and  wept  delight  attempting  say he considered  beaver his friend while  beaver confessed  affectionate looks more eloquent even than tears it had learned  ten minutes far more than all books would have taught   seventy years they returned handinhand   bellman unmanned for  moment  noble emotion said “this amply repays all  wearisome days we have spent   billowy ocean” such friends   beaver  butcher became have seldom if ever been known in winter or summer ‘twas always  same you could never meet either alone and when quarrels aroseas one frequently finds quarrels will spite  every endeavour the song   jubjub recurred  their minds and cemented their friendship  ever fit  sixth the barrister’s dream they sought   thimbles they sought   care they pursued   forks  hope they threatened  life   railwayshare they charmed   smiles  soap but  barrister weary  proving  vain that  beaver’s lacemaking  wrong fell asleep   dreams saw  creature quite plain that his fancy had dwelt  so long he dreamed   stood   shadowy court where  snark   glass   eye dressed  gown bands  wig  defending  pig on  charge  deserting  sty the witnesses proved without error or flaw that  sty  deserted when found and  judge kept explaining  state   law in  soft undercurrent  sound the indictment had never been clearly expressed and  seemed   snark had begun and had spoken three hours before any one guessed what  pig  supposed  have done the jury had each formed  different view long before  indictment  read and they all spoke  once so  none  them knew one word   others had said “you must know” said  judge but  snark exclaimed “fudge” that statute  obsolete quite let me tell you my friends  whole question depends on  ancient manorial right “in  matter  treason  pig would appear to have aided but scarcely abetted while  charge  insolvency fails   clear if you grant  plea ‘never indebted’ “the fact  desertion i  not dispute but  guilt  i trust  removed so far  related   costs  this suit by  alibi which  been proved “my poor client’s fate now depends  your votes” here  speaker sat down  his place and directed  judge  refer  his notes and briefly  sum up  case but  judge said  never had summed up before so  snark undertook  instead and summed  so well   came  far more than  witnesses ever had said when  verdict  called for  jury declined as  word  so puzzling  spell but they ventured  hope   snark wouldn’t mind undertaking  duty  well so  snark found  verdict although   owned it  spent   toils   day when  said  word “guilty”  jury all groaned and some  them fainted away then  snark pronounced sentence  judge being quite too nervous  utter  word when  rose   feet there  silence like night and  fall   pin might  heard “transportation  life”   sentence  gave “and then   fined forty pound” the jury all cheered though  judge said  feared that  phrase  not legally sound but their wild exultation  suddenly checked when  jailer informed them  tears such  sentence would have not  slightest effect as  pig had been dead  some years the judge left  court looking deeply disgusted but  snark though  little aghast as  lawyer  whom  defense  entrusted went bellowing    last thus  barrister dreamed while  bellowing seemed to grow every moment more clear till  woke   knell   furious bell which  bellman rang close  his ear fit  seventh the banker’s fate they sought   thimbles they sought   care they pursued   forks  hope they threatened  life   railwayshare they charmed   smiles  soap and  banker inspired   courage so new it  matter  general remark rushed madly ahead   lost  their view in his zeal  discover  snark but while   seeking  thimbles  care a bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh and grabbed   banker who shrieked  despair for  knew   useless  fly he offered large discounthe offered  cheque drawn “to bearer”  sevenpoundsten but  bandersnatch merely extended  neck and grabbed   banker again without rest or pausewhile those frumious jaws went savagely snapping around he skipped   hopped   floundered  flopped till fainting  fell   ground the bandersnatch fled   others appeared led    fearstricken yell and  bellman remarked “it  just  i feared” and solemnly tolled  his bell he  black   face  they scarcely could trace the least likeness  what  had been while so great  his fright  his waistcoat turned white a wonderful thing   seen to  horror  all who  present  day he uprose  full evening dress and  senseless grimaces endeavoured  say what his tongue could no longer express down  sank   chairran his hands through his hair and chanted  mimsiest tones words whose utter inanity proved his insanity while  rattled  couple  bones “leave him here  his fateit  getting so late” the bellman exclaimed   fright “we have lost half  day any further delay and we sha’nt catch  snark before night” fit  eighth the vanishing they sought   thimbles they sought   care they pursued   forks  hope they threatened  life   railwayshare they charmed   smiles  soap they shuddered  think   chase might fail and  beaver excited  last went bounding along   tip   tail for  daylight  nearly past “there  thingumbob shouting”  bellman said “he  shouting like mad only hark he  waving his hands   wagging his head he  certainly found  snark” they gazed  delight while  butcher exclaimed “he  always  desperate wag” they beheld himtheir bakertheir hero unnamed on  top   neighboring crag erect  sublime  one moment  time in  next  wild figure they saw as if stung   spasm plunge into  chasm while they waited  listened  awe “it’s  snark”   sound  first came  their ears and seemed almost too good   true then followed  torrent  laughter  cheers then  ominous words “it’s  boo” then silence some fancied they heard   air a weary  wandering sigh then sounded like “jum” but  others declare it  only  breeze  went by they hunted till darkness came on but they found not  button or feather or mark by which they could tell  they stood   ground where  baker had met   snark in  midst   word   trying  say in  midst  his laughter  glee he had softly  suddenly vanished away for  snark was  boojum you see the end  end of the
