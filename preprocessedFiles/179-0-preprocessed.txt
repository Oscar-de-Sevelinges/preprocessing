after this she carried her head less becomingly she turned away   window  last pressing her hands  her eyes “it’s too horrible” she exclaimed “i shall go backi shall go back” and she flung herself

sketch “i think you mean simply  you  irritated” “ah  that yes” said his companion   little bitter laugh “it’s  darkest day  my lifeand you know what  means” “wait till tomorrow” rejoined  young man “yes we have made  great mistake if there  any doubt about  today there certainly   none tomorrow ce sera clair au moins” the young man  silent  few moments driving his pencil then  last “there  no

dearest sister” said  young man always intent upon his drawing “it’s  first time you have told me i am not clever” “well  your own theory i can’t call   mistake” answered his sister pertinently enough the young man gave  clear fresh laugh “you  least  clever enough dearest sister”  said “i  not so when i proposed this” “was  you who proposed it” asked her brother she turned her head  gave him  little stare “do you desire  credit  it” “if you like i  take  blame”  said looking up   smile “yes” she rejoined   moment “you make no difference  these things you have no sense  property” the young

drawing   bring me fifty francs” “voyons” said  lady putting out her hand he added  touch or two  then gave her his sketch she looked  it but she went   her idea   moment before “if  woman   ask you  marry her you would say ‘certainly my dear  pleasure’ and you would marry her   ridiculously happy then   end  three months you would say  her ‘you know  blissful day when i begged you   mine’” the young man had risen   table stretching his arms  little  walked   window “that   description   charming nature”  said “oh yes you have  charming nature i regard   our capital if i had not been convinced   i should never have taken  risk  bringing you  this dreadful country” “this comical country this delightful country” exclaimed  young man   broke into  most animated laughter “is  those women scrambling into  omnibus” asked his companion “what do you suppose   attraction” “i suppose there   very goodlooking man inside” said  young man “in each  them they come along  hundreds   men  this country don’t seem  all handsome as   womeni have never seen so many  once since i left  convent” “the women  very pretty” her brother declared “and  whole affair  very amusing i must make

inspired  liveliest confidence “be sure you put  plenty  snow” said his sister “bonté divine what  climate” “i shall leave  sketch all white  i shall put   little figures  black”  young man answered laughing “and i shall call itwhat   line  keatsmidmay’s eldest child” “i don’t remember” said  lady “that mamma ever told me   like this” “mamma never told you anything disagreeable and it’s not like

the young man turned  little  looked  her  his crayon poised “my dear eugenia”  murmured “were you so happy  sea” eugenia got up she still held  her hand  drawing her brother had given her it   bold expressive sketch   group  miserable people   deck   steamer clinging together  clutching  each other while  vessel lurched downward   terrific angle into  hollow   wave it  extremely clever  full   sort  tragicomical power eugenia dropped her eyes upon   made  sad grimace “how can you draw such odious scenes” she asked “i should like  throw  into  fire” and she tossed  paper away her brother watched quietly  see where  went it fluttered down   floor where  let  lie she came toward  window pinching  her waist “why don’t you reproach meabuse me” she asked “i think i should feel better then why don’t you tell me  you hate me  bringing you here” “because you would not believe it i adore you dear sister i am delighted   here  i am charmed   prospect” “i don’t know what had taken possession  me i had lost my head” eugenia went on the young man  his side went  plying his pencil “it  evidently  most curious  interesting country here we are  i mean  enjoy it” his companion turned away   impatient step but presently came back “high spirits  doubtless  excellent thing” she said “but you give one too much  them  i can’t see  they have done you any good” the young man stared  lifted eyebrows smiling  tapped his handsome nose  his pencil “they have made me happy” “that   least they could do they have made you nothing else you have gone through life thanking fortune  such very small favors  she  never put herself  any trouble  you” “she must have put herself   little i think  present me  so admirable  sister” “be serious felix you forget  i am your elder” “with  sister then so elderly” rejoined felix laughing “i hoped we had left seriousness  europe” “i fancy you  find  here remember  you  nearly thirty years old   you  nothing but  obscure bohemiana penniless correspondent   illustrated newspaper” “obscure  much  you please but not so much   bohemian  you think and not  all penniless i have  hundred pounds  my pocket i have  engagement  make fifty sketches  i mean  paint  portraits  all our cousins   all their cousins   hundred dollars  head” “you  not ambitious” said eugenia “you are dear baroness”  young man replied the baroness  silent  moment looking out   sleetdarkened graveyard   bumping horsecars “yes i am ambitious” she said  last “and my ambition  brought me  this dreadful place” she glanced about herthe room had  certain vulgar nudity  bed   window  curtainlessand she gave  little passionate sigh “poor old ambition” she exclaimed then she flung herself down upon  sofa which stood near against  wall  covered her face  her hands her brother went   his drawing rapidly  skillfully after some moments  sat down beside her  showed her his sketch “now don’t you think that’s pretty good   obscure bohemian”  asked “i have knocked off another fifty francs” eugenia glanced   little picture   laid   her lap “yes   very clever” she said and   moment she added “do you suppose our cousins do that” “do what” “get into those things  look like that” felix meditated awhile “i really can’t say it   interesting  discover” “oh  rich people can’t” said  baroness “are you very sure they  rich” asked felix lightly his sister slowly turned  her place looking  him “heavenly powers” she murmured “you have  way  bringing out things” “it  certainly  much pleasanter if they  rich” felix declared “do you suppose if i had not known they  rich i would ever have come” the young man met his sister’s somewhat peremptory eye  his bright contented glance “yes  certainly   pleasanter”  repeated “that  all i expect  them” said  baroness “i don’t count upon their being clever or friendlyat firstor elegant or interesting but i assure you i insist upon their being rich” felix leaned his head upon  back   sofa  looked awhile   oblong patch  sky  which  window served  frame the snow  ceasing  seemed  him   sky had begun  brighten “i count upon their being rich”  said  last “and powerful  clever  friendly  elegant  interesting  generally delightful tu vas voir” and  bent forward  kissed his sister “look there”  went on “as  portent even while i speak  sky  turning  color  gold  day  going   splendid” and indeed within five minutes  weather had changed the sun broke out through  snowclouds  jumped into  baroness’s room “bonté divine” exclaimed this lady “what  climate” “we  go out  see  world” said felix and after  while they went out the air had grown warm  well  brilliant  sunshine had dried  pavements they walked about  streets  hazard looking   people   houses  shops   vehicles  blazing blue sky   muddy crossings  hurrying men   slowstrolling maidens  fresh red bricks   bright green trees  extraordinary mixture  smartness  shabbiness from one hour  another  day had grown vernal even   bustling

same sort  attention   would have given   movements   lively young person   bright complexion such attention would have been demonstrative  complimentary    present case felix might have passed   undispirited young exile revisiting  haunts  his childhood he kept looking   violent blue   sky   scintillating air   scattered  multiplied patches  color “comme c’est bariolé eh”  said  his sister   foreign tongue which they both appeared  feel  mysterious prompting occasionally  use “yes   bariolé indeed”  baroness answered “i don’t like  coloring  hurts my eyes” “it shows how extremes meet”  young man rejoined “instead  coming   west we seem  have gone   east the way  sky touches  housetops  just like cairo   red  blue signboards patched over  face  everything remind one  mahometan decorations” “the young women  not mahometan” said his companion “they can’t  said  hide their faces i never saw anything so bold” “thank heaven they don’t hide their faces” cried felix “their faces  uncommonly pretty” “yes their faces  often very pretty” said  baroness who   very clever woman she  too clever  woman not   capable   great deal  just  fine observation she clung more closely than usual  her brother’s arm she  not exhilarated   was she said very little but she noted  great many things  made her reflections she   little excited she felt  she had indeed come   strange country

probable  moment  moment  one would  jostled the baroness had never seen so many people walking about before she had never been so mixed up  people she did not know but little  little she felt  this fair   more serious undertaking she went  her brother into  large public garden which seemed very pretty but where she  surprised  seeing no carriages the afternoon  drawing   close  coarse vivid

girls  called his sister’s attention  them this latter measure however  superfluous   baroness had inspected narrowly these charming young ladies “i feel  intimate conviction  our cousins  like that” said felix the baroness hoped so but this  not what she said “they  very pretty” she said “but they  mere little girls where   womenthe women  thirty” “of thirtythree do you mean” her brother  going  ask   understood often both what she said  what she did not say but  only exclaimed upon  beauty   sunset while  baroness who had come  seek her fortune reflected   would certainly  well  her if  persons against whom she might need  measure herself should all  mere little girls the sunset  superb they stopped  look  it felix declared   had never seen such  gorgeous mixture  colors the baroness also thought  splendid  she  perhaps  more easily pleased   fact  while she stood there she  conscious  much admiring observation   part  various nicelooking people who passed  way   whom  distinguished strikinglydressed woman   foreign air exclaiming upon  beauties  nature   boston street corner   french tongue could not   object  indifference eugenia’s spirits rose she surrendered herself   certain tranquil gaiety if she had come  seek her fortune  seemed  her  her fortune would  easy  find there   promise     gorgeous purity   western sky there   intimation   mild unimpertinent gaze   passers   certain natural facility  things “you  not go back  silberstadt eh” asked felix “not tomorrow” said  baroness “nor write   reigning prince” “i shall write  him  they evidently know nothing about him over here” “he  not believe you” said  young man “i advise you  let him alone” felix himself continued    high good humor brought up among ancient customs   picturesque cities  yet found plenty  local color   little puritan metropolis that evening after dinner  told his sister   should go forth early   morrow  look up their cousins “you  very impatient” said eugenia “what can  more natural”  asked “after seeing all those pretty girls today if one’s cousins    pattern  sooner one knows them  better” “perhaps they  not” said eugenia “we ought  have brought some lettersto some other people” “the other people would not  our kinsfolk” “possibly they would  none  worse  that”  baroness replied her brother looked  her  his eyebrows lifted “that  not what you said when you first proposed  me  we should come out here  fraternize  our relatives you said     prompting  natural affection  when i suggested some reasons against  you declared   voix du sang should go before everything” “you remember all that” asked  baroness “vividly i  greatly moved  it” she  walking up  down  room  she had done   morning she stopped  her walk  looked  her brother she apparently  going  say something but she checked herself  resumed her walk then   few moments she said something different which had  effect   explanation   suppression  her earlier thought “you  never  anything but  child dear brother” “one would suppose  you madam” answered felix laughing “were  thousand years old” “i amsometimes” said  baroness “i  go then  announce  our cousins  arrival   personage so extraordinary they  immediately come  pay you their respects” eugenia paced  length   room again  then she stopped before her brother laying her hand upon his arm “they  not  come  see me” she said “you  not  allow that that  not  way i shall meet them first” and  answer  his interrogative glance she went on “you  go  examine  report you  come back  tell me who they   what they are

who had  lively faith   justness  his sister’s arrangements she looked  him  momentat his expression  agreeable veracity and   justness   admired she replied “say what you please tell my story   way  seems  you mostnatural” and she bent her forehead  him  kiss chapter ii the next day  splendid  felix had prophesied if  winter had suddenly leaped into spring  spring had   moment  quickly leaped

earnestly her companion  silent then she said “well perhaps it’s not  much use” charlotte looked  her  little  then kissed her “i hope you   better when we come back” “my dear sister i am very well” said gertrude charlotte went down  large brick walk   garden gate her companion strolled slowly toward  house at  gate charlotte met  young man who  coming ina tall fair young man wearing  high hat   pair  thread gloves he  handsome but rather too stout he had  pleasant smile “oh mr brand” exclaimed  young lady “i came  see whether your sister  not going  church” said  young man “she says she  not

very glad  talk  her for  i should  willing  absent myself  almost any occasion  worship however attractive” “well i suppose you know” said charlotte softly  if positive acceptance  this proposition might  dangerous “but i am afraid i shall  late” “i hope you  have  pleasant sermon” said  young man “oh mr gilman  always pleasant” charlotte answered and she went  her way mr brand went into  garden where gertrude hearing  gate close behind him turned  looked  him for  moment she watched him coming then she turned away but almost immediately she corrected this movement  stood still facing him he took off his hat  wiped his forehead   approached then  put  his hat again  held out his hand his hat being removed you would have perceived  his forehead  very large  smooth  his hair abundant but rather colorless his nose  too large  his mouth  eyes  too small but  all this  was  i have said  young man  striking appearance the expression  his little cleancolored blue eyes  irresistibly gentle

you” gertrude answered “i am not going  church” she had shaken hands  him  held her hand  moment “have you any special reason  not going” “yes mr brand” said  young girl “may i ask what  is” she looked  him smiling   her smile  i have intimated there   certain dullness but mingled  this dullness  something sweet  suggestive “because  sky  so blue” she said he looked   sky which  magnificent  then said smiling too “i have heard  young ladies staying  home  bad weather but never  good your sister whom i met   gate tells me you  depressed”  added “depressed i am never depressed” “oh surely

speaking  miss wentworth” “my name  gertrude wentworth” murmured  young woman “thentheni have  honorthe pleasureof being your cousin” the young man had so much  character   apparition  this announcement seemed  complete his unreality “what cousin who  you” said gertrude he stepped back  few paces  looked up   house then glanced round him   garden   distant view after this  burst out laughing “i see  must seem  you very strange”  said there was after all something substantial  his laughter gertrude looked  him  head  foot yes   remarkably handsome but his smile  almost  grimace “it  very still”  went on coming nearer again and  she only looked  him  reply  added “are you all alone” “everyone  gone  church” said gertrude “i  afraid  that”  young man exclaimed “but i hope you  not afraid  me” “you ought  tell me who you are” gertrude answered “i am afraid  you” said  young man “i had  different plan i expected  servant would take  my card   you would put your heads together

afraid  me then” asked  young man again  his light laugh she wondered  moment  then “we  not afraidhere” she said “ah comme vous devez avoir raison” cried  young man looking all round him appreciatively it   first time  gertrude had heard so many words  french spoken they gave her something   sensation her companion followed her watching   certain excitement  his own this tall interestinglooking girl dressed  her clear crisp muslin he paused   hall where there   broad white staircase   white balustrade “what  pleasant house”  said “it’s lighter inside than   out” “it’s pleasanter here” said gertrude  she led  way into  parlora high clean rather emptylooking room here they stood looking  each otherthe young man smiling more than ever gertrude very serious trying  smile “i don’t believe you know my name”  said “i am called felix young your father  my uncle my mother  his half sister  older than he” “yes” said gertrude “and she turned roman catholic  married  europe” “i see you know” said  young man “she married  she died your father’s family didn’t like her husband they called him  foreigner but   not my poor father  born  sicily but his parents

began  laugh again “i can easily  french if   please you” “you   foreigner  some sort” said gertrude “of some sortyes i suppose so but who can say  what sort i don’t think we have ever had occasion  settle  question you know there  people like that about their country their religion their profession they can’t tell” gertrude stood there gazing she had not asked him  sit down she had never heard  people like that she wanted  hear “where do you live” she asked “they can’t tell that either” said felix “i am afraid you  think they  little better than vagabonds i have lived anywhereeverywhere i really think i have lived  every city  europe” gertrude gave  little long soft exhalation it made  young man smile  her again  his smile made her blush  little to take refuge  blushing she asked him if after his long walk   not hungry or thirsty her hand   her pocket she  fumbling   little key  her sister had given her “ah my dear young lady”  said clasping his hands  little “if you could give me  charity  glass  wine” gertrude gave  smile   little nod  went quickly out   room presently she came back   very large decanter  one hand   plate   other  which  placed  big round cake   frosted top

drinking smiling talking “i am very hungry”  said “i am not  all tired i am never tired but i am very hungry” “you must stay  dinner” said gertrude “at two o’clock they  all have come back  church you  see  others” “who   others” asked  young man “describe them all” “you  see  yourself it  you  must tell me now about your sister” “my sister   baroness münster” said felix on hearing  his sister   baroness gertrude got up  walked about slowly  front  him she  silent  moment she  thinking  it “why didn’t she come too” she asked “she did come she   boston   hotel” “we  go  see her” said gertrude looking  him “she begs you  not”  young man replied “she sends you her love she sent me  announce her she  come  pay her respects  your father” gertrude felt herself trembling again a baroness münster who sent  brilliant young man  “announce” her who  coming   queen  sheba came  solomon  pay her “respects”  quiet mr wentworthsuch  personage presented herself  gertrude’s vision   most effective unexpectedness for  moment she hardly knew what  say “when  she come” she asked  last “as soon  you  allow hertomorrow she  very impatient” answered felix who wished   agreeable “tomorrow yes” said gertrude she wished  ask more about her but she hardly knew what could  predicated   baroness münster “is sheis shemarried” felix had finished his cake  wine  got up fixing upon  young girl his bright expressive eyes “she  married   german princeprince adolf  silberstadtschreckenstein he  not  reigning prince    younger brother” gertrude gazed  her informant her lips  slightly parted “is she aa princess” she asked  last “oh no” said  young man “her position  rather  singular one it’s  morganatic marriage” “morganatic” these  new names  new words  poor gertrude “that’s what they call  marriage you know contracted between  scion   ruling house andand  common mortal they made eugenia  baroness poor woman but   all they could do now they want  dissolve  marriage prince adolf between ourselves   ninny but his brother who   clever man  plans  him eugenia naturally enough makes difficulties not however  i think she cares muchshe’s  very clever woman i’m sure you’ll like herbut she wants  bother them just now everything  en l’air” the cheerful offhand tone  which her visitor related this darkly romantic tale seemed  gertrude very strange but  seemed also  convey  certain flattery  herself  recognition  her wisdom  dignity she felt  dozen impressions stirring within her  presently  one   uppermost found words “they want  dissolve her marriage” she asked “so  appears” “and against her will” “against her right” “she must  very unhappy” said gertrude her visitor looked  her smiling  raised his hand   back  his head  held  there  moment “so she says”  answered “that’s her story she told me  tell  you” “tell me more” said gertrude “no i  leave   her she does  better” gertrude gave her little excited sigh again “well if she  unhappy” she said “i am glad she  come

before he came into  parlor looking  gertrude he had two little books  his hand on seeing gertrude’s companion  slowly stopped looking  him “is this  cousin” asked felix then gertrude saw  she must introduce him but her ears and  sympathy her lips  full  all   had been telling her “this   prince” she said “the prince  silberstadtschreckenstein” felix burst out laughing  mr brand stood staring while  others who had passed into  house appeared behind him   open doorway chapter iii that evening  dinner felix young gave his sister  baroness münster  account  his impressions she saw   had come back   highest possible spirits but this fact  her own mind  not  reason  rejoicing she had but  limited confidence  her brother’s judgment his capacity  taking rosecolored views  such   vulgarize one   prettiest  tints still she supposed  could  trusted  give her  mere facts  she invited him  some eagerness  communicate them “i suppose  least they didn’t turn you out   door” she said “you have been away some ten hours” “turn me   door” felix exclaimed “they took me  their hearts they killed  fatted calf” “i know what you want  say they   collection  angels” “exactly” said felix “they   collection  angelssimply” “c’est bien vague” remarked  baroness “what  they like” “like nothing you ever saw” “i am sure i am much obliged but   hardly more definite seriously they  glad  see you” “enchanted it  been  proudest day  my life never never have i been so lionized i assure you i  cock   walk my dear sister” said  young man “nous n’avons qu’à nous tenir we shall  great swells” madame münster looked  him  her eye exhibited  slight responsive spark she touched her lips   glass  wine  then she said “describe them give me  picture” felix drained his own glass “well it’s   country

primitive it’s patriarchal it’s  ton   golden age” “and have they nothing golden but their ton are there no symptoms  wealth” “i should say there  wealth without symptoms a plain homely way  life nothing  show  very little forwhat shall i call itfor  senses but  great aisance   lot  money out  sight  comes forward very quietly  subscriptions  institutions  repairing tenements  paying doctor’s bills perhaps even  portioning daughters” “and  daughters” madame münster demanded “how many  there” “there  two charlotte  gertrude” “are they pretty” “one  them” said felix “which  that” the young man  silent looking  his sister “charlotte”  said  last she looked  him  return “i see you   love  gertrude they must  puritans  their fingertips anything but gay” “no they  not gay” felix admitted “they  sober they  even severe they    pensive cast they take things hard i think there  something  matter  them they have some melancholy memory or some depressing expectation it’s not  epicurean

stirring up but they  wonderfully kind  gentle and they  appreciative they think one clever they think one remarkable” “that  very fine so far   goes” said  baroness “but  we   shut up  these three people mr wentworth   two young womenwhat did you say their names weredeborah  hephzibah” “oh no there  another little girl  cousin  theirs  very pretty creature  thorough little american and then there   son   house” “good” said  baroness “we  coming   gentlemen what   son   house” “i am afraid  gets tipsy” “he then   epicurean temperament how old  he” “he   boy  twenty  pretty young fellow but i am afraid   vulgar tastes and then there  mr branda very tall young man  sort  laypriest they seem  think  good deal  him but i don’t exactly make him out” “and  there nothing” asked  baroness “between these extremesthis mysterious ecclesiastic   intemperate youth” “oh yes there  mr acton i think” said  young man   nod  his sister “that you  like mr acton” “remember  i am very fastidious” said  baroness “has  very good manners” “he  have them  you he   man   world   been  china” madame münster gave  little laugh “a man   chinese world he must  very interesting” “i have  idea   brought home  fortune” said felix “that  always interesting is  young goodlooking clever” “he  less than forty    baldish head  says witty things i rather think” added  young man “that   admire  baroness

descended her american kinsfolk  stationed   portico felix waved his hat  them   tall lean gentleman   high forehead   clean shaven face came forward toward  garden gate charlotte wentworth walked  his side gertrude came behind more slowly both  these young ladies wore rustling silk dresses felix ushered his sister into  gate “be very gracious”  said  her but  saw  admonition  superfluous eugenia  prepared   gracious  only eugenia could be felix knew no keener pleasure than   able  admire his sister unrestrictedly  if  opportunity  frequent   not inveterate when she desired  please she   him   everyone else  most charming woman   world then  forgot  she  ever anything else  she  sometimes hard  perverse    occasionally afraid  her now  she took his arm  pass into  garden  felt  she desired  she proposed  please  this situation made him very happy eugenia would please the tall gentleman came  meet her looking very rigid  grave but    rigidity  had no illiberal meaning mr wentworth’s manner  pregnant   contrary   sense  grand responsibility   solemnity   occasion   being difficult  show sufficient deference   lady  once so distinguished  so unhappy felix had observed   day before his characteristic pallor  now  perceived  there  something almost cadaverous  his uncle’s highfeatured white face but so clever  this young man’s quick sympathies  perceptions   already learned   these semimortuary manifestations there  no cause  alarm his light imagination had gained  glimpse  mr wentworth’s spiritual mechanism  taught him that  old man being infinitely conscientious  special operation  conscience within him announced itself  several   indications  physical faintness the baroness took her uncle’s hand  stood looking  him  her ugly face  her beautiful smile “have i done right  come” she asked “very right very right” said mr wentworth solemnly he had arranged  his mind  little speech but now  quite faded away he felt almost frightened he had never

right   just   acceptable he always slept badly   night before  had lain awake much more even than usual asking himself these questions the strange word “morganatic”  constantly  his ears  reminded him   certain mrs morgan whom  had once known  who had been  bold unpleasant woman he had  feeling    his duty so long   baroness looked  him smiling   way  meet her glance  his own scrupulously adjusted consciously frigid organs  vision but  this occasion  failed  perform his duty   last he looked away toward his daughters “we  very glad  see you”  had said “allow me  introduce my daughtersmiss charlotte wentworth miss gertrude wentworth” the baroness thought she had never seen people less demonstrative but charlotte kissed her  took her hand looking  her sweetly  solemnly gertrude seemed  her almost funereal though gertrude might have found  source  gaiety   fact  felix  his magnificent smile had been talking  her  had greeted her   very old friend when she kissed  baroness she had tears  her eyes madame münster took each  these young women   hand  looked  them all over charlotte thought her very strangelooking  singularly dressed she could not have said whether   well or ill she  glad  any rate  they had put  their silk gownsespecially gertrude “my cousins  very pretty” said  baroness turning her eyes  one   other “your daughters  very handsome sir” charlotte blushed quickly she had never yet heard her personal appearance alluded    loud expressive voice gertrude looked awaynot  felix she  extremely pleased it  not  compliment  pleased her she did not believe it she thought herself very plain she could hardly have told you  source  her satisfaction  came  something   way  baroness spoke    not diminishedit  rather deepened oddly enoughby  young girl’s disbelief mr wentworth  silent  then  asked formally “won’t you come into  house” “these  not all you have some other children” said  baroness “i have  son” mr wentworth answered “and why doesn’t  come  meet me” eugenia cried “i am afraid   not so charming  his sisters” “i don’t know i  see about it”  old man declared “he  rather afraid  ladies” charlotte said softly “he  very handsome” said gertrude  loud  she could “we  go   find him we  draw him out  his cachette” and  baroness took mr wentworth’s arm who  not aware   had offered   her  who  they walked toward  house wondered whether  ought  have offered   whether   proper  her  take  if  had not been offered “i want  know you well” said  baroness interrupting these meditations “and i want you  know me” “it seems natural  we should know each other” mr wentworth rejoined “we  near relatives” “ah there comes  moment  life when one reverts irresistibly  one’s natural tiesto one’s natural affections you must have found that” said eugenia mr wentworth had been told  day before  felix  eugenia  very clever very brilliant   information had held him  some suspense this   cleverness  supposed  brilliancy  beginning “yes  natural affections  very strong”  murmured “in some people”  baroness declared “not  all” charlotte  walking beside her she took hold  her hand again smiling always “and you cousine where did you get  enchanting complexion” she went on “such lilies  roses” the roses  poor charlotte’s countenance began speedily  predominate over  lilies  she quickened her step  reached  portico “this   country  complexions”  baroness continued addressing herself  mr wentworth “i am convinced they  more delicate there  very good ones  englandin holland but they  very apt   coarse there  too much red” “i think you  find” said mr wentworth “that this country  superior  many respects  those you mention i have been  england  holland” “ah you have been  europe” cried  baroness “why didn’t you come  see me but it’s better after all this way” she said they  entering  house she paused  looked round her “i see you have arranged your houseyour beautiful housein thein  dutch taste” “the house  very old” remarked mr wentworth “general washington once spent  week here” “oh i have heard  washington” cried  baroness “my father used  tell me  him” mr wentworth  silent  moment  then “i found   very well known  europe”  said felix had lingered   garden  gertrude   standing before her  smiling   had done  day before what had happened  day before seemed  her  kind  dream he had been there   had changed everything  others had seen him they had talked  him but   should come again   should  part   future part  her small familiar muchmeditating lifethis needed afresh  evidence  her senses the evidence had come  her senses now  her senses seemed  rejoice  it “what do you think  eugenia” felix asked “isn’t she charming” “she  very brilliant” said gertrude “but i can’t tell yet she seems  me like  singer singing  air you can’t tell till  song  done” “ah  song  never  done” exclaimed  young man laughing “don’t you think her handsome” gertrude had been disappointed   beauty   baroness münster she had expected her  mysterious reasons  resemble  very pretty portrait   empress josephine  which there hung  engraving  one   parlors  which  younger miss wentworth had always greatly admired but  baroness  not  all like thatnot  all though different however she  very wonderful  gertrude felt herself most suggestively corrected it  strange nevertheless  felix should speak   positive way about his sister’s beauty “i think i shall think her handsome” gertrude said “it must  very interesting  know her i don’t feel  if i ever could” “ah you  know her well you  become great friends” felix declared  if this   easiest thing   world “she  very graceful” said gertrude looking after  baroness suspended  her father’s arm it   pleasure  her  say  anyone  graceful felix had been looking about him “and your little cousin  yesterday”  said “who  so wonderfully prettywhat  become  her” “she    parlor” gertrude answered “yes she  very pretty” she felt  if   her duty  take him straight into  house  where  might  near her cousin but after hesitating  moment she lingered still “i didn’t believe you would come back” she said “not come back” cried felix laughing “you didn’t know then  impression made upon this susceptible heart  mine” she wondered whether  meant  impression her cousin lizzie had made “well” she said “i didn’t think we should ever see you again” “and pray what did you think would become  me” “i don’t know i thought you would melt away” “that’s  compliment  my solidity i melt very often” said felix “but there  always something left  me” “i came  waited  you   door because  others did” gertrude went on “but if you had never appeared i should not have been surprised” “i hope” declared felix looking  her “that you would have been disappointed” she looked  him  little  shook her head “nono” “ah par exemple” cried  young man “you deserve  i should never leave you” going into  parlor they found mr wentworth performing introductions a young man  standing before  baroness blushing  good deal laughing  little  shifting his weight  one foot   othera slim mildfaced young man  neatlyarranged features like those  mr wentworth two other gentlemen behind him had risen  their seats   little apart near one   windows stood  remarkably pretty young girl the young girl  knitting  stocking but while her fingers quickly moved she looked  wide brilliant eyes   baroness “and what  your son’s name” said eugenia smiling   young man “my name  clifford wentworth ma’am”  said   tremulous voice “why didn’t you come out  meet me mr clifford wentworth”  baroness demanded  her beautiful smile “i didn’t think you would want me” said  young man slowly sidling about “one always wants  beau cousinif one  one but if you  very nice  me  future i won’t remember  against you” and madame münster transferred her smile   other persons present it rested first upon  candid countenance  longskirted figure  mr brand whose eyes  intently fixed upon mr wentworth  if  beg him not  prolong  anomalous situation mr wentworth pronounced his name eugenia gave him  very charming glance  then looked   other gentleman this latter personage   man  rather less than  usual stature   usual weight   quick observant agreeable dark eye  small quantity  thin dark hair   small moustache he had been standing  his hands  his pockets  when eugenia looked  him  took them out but  did not like mr brand look evasively  urgently  their host he met eugenia’s eyes  appeared  appreciate  privilege  meeting them madame münster instantly felt   was intrinsically  most important person present she  not unconscious  this impression   some degree manifested   little sympathetic nod  which she acknowledged mr wentworth’s announcement “my cousin mr acton” “your cousinnot mine” said  baroness “it only depends upon you” mr acton declared laughing the baroness looked  him  moment  noticed   had very white teeth “let  depend upon your behavior” she said “i think i had better wait i have cousins enough unless i can also claim relationship” she added “with  charming young lady”  she pointed   young girl   window “that’s my sister” said mr acton and gertrude wentworth put her arm round  young girl  led her forward it  not apparently  she needed much leading she came toward  baroness   light quick step   perfect selfpossession rolling her stocking round  needles she had dark blue eyes  dark brown hair she  wonderfully pretty eugenia kissed her  she had kissed  other young women  then held her off  little looking  her “now this  quite another type” she said she pronounced  word   french manner “this   different outline my uncle  different character    your own daughters this felix” she went on “is very much more what we have always thought    american type” the young girl during this exposition  smiling askance  everyone  turn   felix out  turn “i find only one type here” cried felix laughing “the type adorable” this sally  received  perfect silence but felix who learned all things quickly had already learned   silences frequently observed among his new acquaintances  not necessarily restrictive or resentful it was  one might say  silence  expectation  modesty they  all standing round his sister  if they  expecting her  acquit herself   exhibition  some peculiar faculty some brilliant talent their attitude seemed  imply  she   kind  conversational mountebank attired intellectually  gauze  spangles this attitude gave  certain ironical force  madame münster’s next words “now this  your circle” she said  her uncle “this  your salon these  your regular habitués eh i am so glad  see you all together” “oh” said mr wentworth “they  always dropping   out you must do  same” “father” interposed charlotte wentworth “they must do something more” and she turned her sweet serious face  seemed  once timid  placid upon their interesting visitor “what  your name” she asked “eugeniacamilladolores” said  baroness smiling “but you needn’t say all that” “i  say eugenia if you  let me you must come  stay  us” the baroness laid her hand upon charlotte’s arm very tenderly but she reserved herself she  wondering whether  would  possible  “stay”  these people “it would  very charmingvery charming” she said  her eyes wandered over  company over  room she wished  gain time before committing herself her glance fell upon young mr brand who stood there  his arms folded  his hand  his chin looking  her “the gentleman i suppose   sort  ecclesiastic” she said  mr wentworth lowering her voice  little “he   minister” answered mr wentworth “a protestant” asked eugenia “i am  unitarian madam” replied mr brand impressively “ah i see” said eugenia “something new” she had never heard  this form  worship mr acton began  laugh  gertrude looked anxiously  mr brand “you have come very far” said mr wentworth “very farvery far”  baroness replied   graceful shake  her heada shake  might have meant many different things “that’s  reason why you ought  settle down  us” said mr wentworth   dryness  utterance which  eugenia  too intelligent not  feel took nothing   delicacy  his meaning she looked  him    instant  his cold still face she seemed  see  faraway likeness   vaguely remembered image  her mother eugenia   woman  sudden emotions  now unexpectedly she felt one rising  her heart she kept looking round  circle she knew  there  admiration  all  eyes

agreeable foreigners gertrude however had  struggle   great accumulation  obstructions both   subjective   metaphysicians say    objective order  indeed   no small part   purpose  this little history  set forth her struggle what seemed paramount  this abrupt enlargement  mr wentworth’s sympathies  those  his daughters   extension   field  possible mistakes   doctrine   may almost  called   oppressive gravity  mistakes  one   most cherished traditions   wentworth family “i don’t believe she wants  come  stay  this house” said gertrude madame münster  this time forward receiving no other designation than  personal pronoun charlotte  gertrude acquired considerable facility  addressing her directly  “eugenia” but  speaking  her  each other they rarely called her anything but “she” “doesn’t she think  good enough  her” cried little lizzie acton who  always asking unpractical questions  required  strictness no answer   which indeed she expected no other answer than such  she herself invariably furnished   small innocentlysatirical laugh “she certainly expressed  willingness  come” said mr wentworth “that  only politeness” gertrude rejoined “yes she  very politevery polite” said mr wentworth “she  too polite” his son declared   softly growling tone which  habitual  him but which   indication  nothing worse than  vaguely humorous intention “it  very embarrassing” “that  more than can  said  you sir” said lizzie acton  her little laugh “well i don’t mean  encourage her” clifford went on “i’m sure i don’t care if you do” cried lizzie “she  not think  you clifford” said gertrude gravely “i hope not” clifford exclaimed “she  think  robert” gertrude continued   same tone robert acton began  blush but there  no occasion  it  everyone  looking  gertrudeeveryone  least save lizzie who  her pretty head  one side contemplated her brother “why do you attribute motives gertrude” asked mr wentworth “i don’t attribute motives father” said gertrude “i only say she  think  robert  she will” “gertrude judges  herself” acton exclaimed laughing “don’t you gertrude of course  baroness  think  me she  think  me  morning till night” “she   very comfortable here” said charlotte  something   housewife’s pride “she can have  large northeast room and  french bedstead” charlotte added   constant sense   lady’s foreignness “she  not like it” said gertrude “not even if you pin little tidies all over  chairs” “why not dear” asked charlotte perceiving  touch  irony here but not resenting it gertrude had left her chair she  walking about  room her stiff silk dress which she had put   honor   baroness made  sound upon  carpet “i don’t know” she replied “she  want something moremore private” “if she wants   private she can stay  her room” lizzie acton remarked gertrude paused  her walk looking  her “that would not  pleasant” she answered “she wants privacy  pleasure together” robert acton began  laugh again “my dear cousin what  picture” charlotte had fixed her serious eyes upon her sister she wondered whence she had suddenly derived these strange notions mr wentworth also observed his younger daughter “i don’t know what her manner  life may have been”  said “but she certainly never can have enjoyed  more refined  salubrious home” gertrude stood there looking  them all “she   wife   prince” she said “we  all princes here” said mr wentworth “and i don’t know  any palace  this neighborhood    let” “cousin william” robert acton interposed “do you want  do something handsome make them  present  three months   little house over  way” “you  very generous  other people’s things” cried his sister “robert  very generous  his own things” mr wentworth observed dispassionately  looking  cold meditation  his kinsman “gertrude” lizzie went on “i had  idea you  so fond  your new cousin” “which new cousin” asked gertrude “i don’t mean  baroness”  young girl rejoined  her laugh “i thought you expected  see so much  him” “of felix i hope  see  great deal  him” said gertrude simply “then why do you want  keep him out   house” gertrude looked  lizzie acton  then looked away “should you want me  live   house  you lizzie” asked clifford “i hope you never will i hate you” such  this young lady’s reply “father” said gertrude stopping before mr wentworth  smiling   smile  sweeter  her smile always was   rarity “do let them live   little house over  way it   lovely” robert acton had been watching her “gertrude  right”  said “gertrude   cleverest girl   world if i might take  liberty i should strongly recommend their living there” “there  nothing there so pretty   northeast room” charlotte urged “she  make  pretty leave her alone” acton exclaimed gertrude  his compliment had blushed  looked  him    if someone less familiar had complimented her “i am sure she  make  pretty it   very interesting it    place  go to it    foreign house” “are we very sure  we need  foreign house” mr wentworth inquired “do you think  desirable  establish  foreign housein this quiet place” “you speak” said acton laughing “as if    question   poor baroness opening  wineshop or  gamingtable” “it would  too lovely” gertrude declared again laying her hand   back  her father’s chair “that she should open  gamingtable” charlotte asked  great gravity gertrude looked  her  moment  then “yes charlotte” she said simply “gertrude  growing pert” clifford wentworth observed  his humorous young growl “that comes  associating  foreigners” mr wentworth looked up  his daughter who  standing beside him  drew her gently forward “you must  careful”  said “you must keep watch indeed we must all  careful this   great change we    exposed  peculiar influences i don’t say they  bad i don’t judge them  advance but they may perhaps make  necessary  we should exercise  great deal  wisdom  selfcontrol it    different tone” gertrude  silent  moment  deference  her father’s speech then she spoke   manner   not   least  answer  it “i want  see how they  live i am sure they  have different hours she  do all kinds  little things differently when we go over there    like going  europe she  have  boudoir she  invite us  dinnervery late she  breakfast  her room” charlotte gazed  her sister again gertrude’s imagination seemed  her   fairly running riot she had always known  gertrude had  great deal  imaginationshe had been very proud  it but   same time she had always felt     dangerous  irresponsible faculty  now  her sense   moment  seemed  threaten  make her sister  strange person who should come  suddenly    journey talking   peculiar  possibly unpleasant things she had observed charlotte’s imagination took no journeys whatever she kept it   were  her pocket   other furniture  this receptaclea thimble  little box  peppermint   morsel  courtplaster “i don’t believe she would have any dinneror any breakfast” said miss wentworth “i don’t believe she knows how  do anything herself i should have  get her ever so many servants  she wouldn’t like them” “she   maid” said gertrude “a french maid she mentioned her” “i wonder if  maid   little fluted cap  red slippers” said lizzie acton “there   french maid   play  robert took me  see she had pink stockings she  very wicked” “she   soubrette” gertrude announced who had never seen  play  her life “they call   soubrette it    great chance  learn french” charlotte gave  little soft helpless groan she had  vision   wicked theatrical person clad  pink stockings  red shoes  speaking  confounding volubility  incomprehensible tongue flitting through  sacred penetralia   large clean house “that  one reason  favor  their coming here” gertrude went on “but we can make eugenia speak french  us  felix i mean  beginthe next time” mr wentworth had kept her standing near him   gave her his earnest thin unresponsive glance again “i want you  make me  promise gertrude”  said “what  it” she asked smiling “not  get excited not  allow thesethese occurrences    occasion  excitement” she looked down  him  moment  then she shook her head “i don’t think i can promise that father i am excited already” mr wentworth  silent  while they all  silent  if  recognition  something audacious  portentous “i think they had better go   other house” said charlotte quietly “i shall keep them   other house” mr wentworth subjoined more pregnantly gertrude turned away then she looked across  robert acton her cousin robert   great friend  hers she often looked  him this way instead  saying things her glance  this occasion however struck him   substitute   larger volume  diffident utterance than usual inviting him  observe among other things  inefficiency  her father’s designif design  wasfor diminishing   interest  quiet nerves their occasions  contact  their foreign relatives but acton immediately complimented mr wentworth upon his liberality “that’s  very nice thing  do”  said “giving them  little house you  have treated them handsomely and whatever happens you   glad  it” mr wentworth  liberal   knew   liberal it gave him pleasure  know it  feel it  see  recorded  this pleasure   only palpable form  selfindulgence  which  narrator  these incidents   able  charge him “a three days’ visit  most over there  all i should have found possible” madame münster remarked  her brother after they had taken possession   little white house

does not think so” they had  course desired   first  do everything   way  helping her  arrange herself it had seemed  charlotte  there would   great many things  talk about but  baroness  apparently inclined  talk about nothing “write her  note asking her leave  come  see her i think   what she  like” said gertrude “why should i give her  trouble  answering me” charlotte asked “she  have  write

and   case she would spare herself  trouble  having  cook “ah but i must have  cook” cried  baroness “an old negress   yellow turban i have set my heart upon that i want  look out  my window  see her

wentworth’s garden  stopped  looked back  some time   little white house then looking  his companion  his head bent  little  one side  his eyes somewhat contracted “now i suppose that’s what  called

interesting points mr wentworth grew visibly paler “i should like  do you   old prelate  old cardinal or  prior   order” “a prelate  cardinal” murmured mr wentworth “do you refer   roman catholic priesthood” “i mean  old ecclesiastic who should have led  very pure abstinent life now i take    been  case  you sir one sees   your face” felix proceeded “you have been verya very moderate don’t you think one always sees    man’s face” “you see more   man’s face than i should think  looking for” said mr wentworth coldly the baroness rattled her fan  gave her brilliant laugh “it   risk  look so close” she exclaimed “my uncle  some peccadilloes  his conscience” mr wentworth looked  her painfully   loss   so far   signs   pure  abstinent life  visible  his face they  then probably peculiarly manifest “you   beau vieillard dear uncle” said madame münster smiling  her foreign eyes “i think you  paying me  compliment” said  old man “surely i am not  first woman  ever did so” cried  baroness “i think you are” said mr wentworth gravely and turning  felix  added   same tone “please don’t take my likeness my children have my daguerreotype that  quite satisfactory” “i won’t promise” said felix “not  work your head into something” mr wentworth looked  him  then  all  others then  got up  slowly walked away “felix” said gertrude   silence  followed “i wish you would paint my portrait” charlotte wondered whether gertrude  right  wishing this  she looked  mr brand   most legitimate way  ascertaining whatever gertrude did or said charlotte always looked  mr brand it   standing pretext  looking  mr brandalways  charlotte thought   interest  gertrude’s welfare it  true  she felt  tremulous interest  gertrude being right  charlotte  her small still way   heroic sister “we should  glad  have your portrait miss gertrude” said mr brand “i should  delighted  paint so charming  model” felix declared “do you think you  so lovely my dear” asked lizzie acton  her little inoffensive pertness biting off  knot  her knitting “it  not because i think i am beautiful” said gertrude looking all round “i don’t think i am beautiful  all” she spoke   sort  conscious deliberateness   seemed very strange  charlotte  hear her discussing this question so publicly “it  because i think  would  amusing  sit   painted i have always thought that” “i am sorry you have not had better things  think about my daughter” said mr wentworth “you  very beautiful cousin gertrude” felix declared “that’s  compliment” said gertrude “i put all  compliments i receive into  little moneyjug    slit   side i shake them up  down  they rattle there  not many yetonly two or three” “no it’s not  compliment” felix rejoined “see i am careful not  give   form   compliment i didn’t think you  beautiful  first but you have come  seem so little  little” “take care now your jug doesn’t burst” exclaimed lizzie “i think sitting  one’s portrait  only one   various forms  idleness” said mr wentworth “their name  legion” “my dear sir” cried felix “you can’t  said   idle when you  making  man work so” “one might  painted while one  asleep” suggested mr brand   contribution   discussion “ah do paint me while i am asleep” said gertrude  felix smiling and she closed her eyes  little it had  this time become  matter  almost exciting anxiety  charlotte what gertrude would say or would do next she began  sit  her portrait   following dayin  open air   north side   piazza “i wish you would tell me what you think  ushow we seem  you” she said  felix   sat before his easel “you seem  me  best people   world” said felix “you say that” gertrude resumed “because  saves you  trouble  saying anything else” the young man glanced  her over  top  his canvas “what else should i say it would certainly   great deal  trouble  say anything different” “well” said gertrude “you have seen people before  you have liked have you not” “indeed i have thank heaven” “and they have been very different  us” gertrude went on “that only proves” said felix “that there   thousand different ways  being good company” “do you think us good company” asked gertrude “company   king” gertrude  silent  moment  then “there must   thousand different ways  being dreary” she said “and sometimes i think we make use  them all” felix stood up quickly holding up his hand “if you could only keep  look  your face  half  hourwhile i catch it”  said “it  uncommonly handsome” “to look handsome  half  hourthat   great deal  ask  me” she answered “it would   portrait   young woman who  taken some vow some pledge  she repents of” said felix “and who  thinking  over  leisure” “i have taken no vow no pledge” said gertrude very gravely “i have nothing  repent of” “my dear cousin   only  figure  speech i am very sure  no one  your excellent family  anything  repent of” “and yet we  always repenting” gertrude exclaimed “that  what i mean  our being dreary you know  perfectly well you only pretend  you don’t” felix gave  quick laugh “the half hour  going on  yet you  handsomer than ever one must  careful what one says you see” “to me” said gertrude “you can say anything” felix looked  her   artist might  painted  some time  silence “yes you seem  me different  your father  sisterfrom most   people you have lived with”  observed “to say  one’s self” gertrude went on “is like sayingby implication  leastthat one  better i am not better i am much worse but they say themselves  i am different it makes them unhappy” “since you accuse me  concealing my real impressions i may admit  i think  tendencyamong you generallyis   made unhappy too easily” “i wish you would tell   my father” said gertrude “it might make him more unhappy” felix exclaimed laughing “it certainly would i don’t believe you have seen people like that” “ah my dear cousin how do you know what i have seen” felix demanded “how can i tell you” “you might tell me  great many things if you only would you have seen people like yourselfpeople who  bright  gay  fond  amusement we  not fond  amusement” “yes” said felix “i confess  rather strikes me you don’t seem  me  get all  pleasure out  life  you might you don’t seem  me  enjoy do you mind my saying this”  asked pausing “please go on” said  girl earnestly “you seem  me very well placed  enjoying you have money  liberty  what  called  europe  ‘position’ but you take  painful view  life  one may say” “one ought  think  bright  charming  delightful eh” asked gertrude “i should say soif one can it  true  all depends upon that” felix added “you know there   great deal  misery   world” said his model “i have seen  little  it”  young man rejoined “but   all over therebeyond  sea i don’t see any here this   paradise” gertrude said nothing she sat looking   dahlias   currantbushes   garden while felix went   his work “to ‘enjoy’” she began  last “to take lifenot painfully must one do something wrong” felix gave his long light laugh again “seriously i think not and  this reason among others you strike me  very capable  enjoying if  chance  given you  yet   same time  incapable  wrongdoing” “i am sure” said gertrude “that you  very wrong  telling  person  she  incapable  that we  never nearer  evil than when we believe that” “you  handsomer than ever” observed felix irrelevantly gertrude had got used  hearing him say this there  not so much excitement     first “what ought one  do” she continued “to give parties  go   theatre  read novels  keep late hours” “i don’t think it’s what one does or one doesn’t do  promotes enjoyment” her companion answered “it   general way  looking  life” “they look     disciplinethat’s what they do here i have often been told that” “well that’s very good but there  another way” added felix smiling “to look     opportunity” “an opportunityyes” said gertrude “one would get more pleasure  way” “i don’t attempt  say anything better   than    been my own wayand   not saying much” felix had laid down his palette  brushes   leaning back  his arms folded  judge  effect  his work “and you know”  said “i am  very petty personage” “you have  great deal  talent” said gertrude “nono”  young man rejoined   tone  cheerful impartiality “i have not  great deal  talent it  nothing  all remarkable i assure you i should know if  were i shall always  obscure the world  never hear  me” gertrude looked  him   strange feeling she  thinking   great world which  knew  which she did not  how full  brilliant talents  must be since  could afford  make light  his abilities “you needn’t  general attach much importance  anything i tell you”  pursued “but you may believe me when i say thisthat i am little better than  goodnatured featherhead” “a featherhead” she repeated “i am  species  bohemian” “a bohemian” gertrude had never heard this term before save   geographical denomination  she quite failed  understand  figurative meaning which her companion appeared  attach  it but  gave her pleasure felix had pushed back his chair  risen  his feet  slowly came toward her smiling “i am  sort  adventurer”  said looking down  her she got up meeting his smile “an adventurer” she repeated “i should like  hear your adventures” for  instant she believed    going  take her hand but  dropped his own hands suddenly into  pockets  his paintingjacket “there  no reason why you shouldn’t”  said “i have been  adventurer but my adventures have been very innocent they have all been happy ones i don’t think there  any i shouldn’t tell they  very pleasant  very pretty i should like  go over them  memory sit down again  i  begin”  added   moment  his naturally persuasive smile gertrude sat down again   day  she sat down  several other days felix while  plied his brush told her  great many stories  she listened  charmed avidity her eyes rested upon his lips she  very serious sometimes  her air  wondering gravity  thought she  displeased but felix never believed  more than  single moment  any displeasure  his own producing this would have been fatuity if  optimism  expressed had not been much more  hope than  prejudice it  beside  matter  say   had  good conscience   best conscience   sort  selfreproach  this young man’s brilliantly healthy nature spent itself  objective good intentions which  ignorant  any test save exactness  hitting their mark he told gertrude how  had walked over france  italy

through foreign lands giving provincial concerts he told her also how  had been  momentary ornament   troupe  strolling actors engaged   arduous task  interpreting shakespeare  french  german polish

she came nearer she recognized mr brand she had  feeling   not having seen him  some time she could not have said  how long   yet seemed  her   had been very lately   house “may i walk back  you”  asked and when she had said   might if  wanted  observed   had seen her  recognized her half  mile away “you must have very good eyes” said gertrude “yes i have very good eyes miss gertrude” said mr brand she perceived   meant something but   long time past mr brand had constantly meant something  she had almost got used  it she felt however  what  meant had now  renewed power  disturb her  perplex  agitate her he walked beside her  silence   moment  then  added “i have had no trouble  seeing  you  beginning  avoid me but perhaps”  went on “one needn’t have had very good eyes  see that” “i have not avoided you” said gertrude without looking  him “i think you have been unconscious  you  avoiding me” mr brand replied “you have not even known  i  there” “well you  here now mr brand” said gertrude   little laugh “i know  very well” he made no rejoinder he simply walked beside her slowly  they  obliged  walk over  soft grass presently they came  another gate which  closed mr brand laid his hand upon it but  made no movement  open it  stood  looked  his companion “you  very much interestedvery much absorbed”  said gertrude glanced  him she saw    pale    looked excited she had never seen mr brand excited before  she felt   spectacle if fully carried out would  impressive almost painful “absorbed  what” she asked then she looked away   illuminated sky she felt guilty  uncomfortable  yet she  vexed  herself  feeling so but mr brand   stood there looking  her  his small kind persistent eyes represented  immense body  halfobliterated obligations   rising again into  certain distinctness “you have new interests new occupations”  went on “i don’t know  i can say  you have new duties we have always old ones gertrude”  added “please open  gate mr brand” she said  she felt  if  saying so she  cowardly  petulant but  opened  gate  allowed her  pass then  closed  behind himself before she had time  turn away  put out his hand  held her  instant   wrist “i want  say something  you”  said “i know what you want  say” she answered and she    point  adding “and i know just how you  say it” but these words she kept back “i love you gertrude”  said “i love you very much i love you more than ever” he said  words just  she had known  would she had heard them before they had no charm  her she had said  herself before    very strange it  supposed   delightful   woman  listen  such words but these seemed  her flat  mechanical “i wish you would forget that” she declared “how can iwhy should i”  asked “i have made you no promisegiven you no pledge” she said looking  him  her voice trembling  little “you have let me feel  i have  influence over you you have opened your mind  me” “i never opened my mind  you mr brand” gertrude cried  some vehemence “then you  not so frank  i thoughtas we all thought” “i don’t see what anyone else had  do  it” cried  girl “i mean your father  your sister you know  makes them happy  think you  listen  me” she gave  little laugh “it doesn’t make them happy” she said “nothing makes them happy no one  happy here” “i think your cousin  very happymr young” rejoined mr brand   soft almost timid tone “so much  better  him” and gertrude gave her little laugh again the young man looked  her  moment “you  very much changed”  said “i am glad  hear it” gertrude declared “i am not i have known you  long time  i have loved you  you were” “i am much obliged  you” said gertrude “i must  going home” he  his side gave  little laugh “you certainly do avoid meyou see” “avoid me then” said  girl he looked  her again  then very gently “no i  not avoid you”  replied “but i  leave you   present  yourself i think you  rememberafter  whilesome   things you have forgotten i think you  come back  me i have great faith  that” this time his voice  very touching there   strong reproachful force  what  said  gertrude could answer nothing he turned away  stood there leaning his elbows   gate  looking   beautiful sunset gertrude left him  took her way home again but when she reached  middle   next field she suddenly burst into tears her tears seemed  her  have been  long time gathering   some moments    kind  glee  shed them but they presently passed away there  something  little hard about gertrude  she never wept again chapter vi going   afternoon  call upon his niece mr wentworth more than once found robert

wentworth’s one summer morningvery few arms indeed had ever passed into mr wentworth’sand led him across  garden  along  road into  studio which  had extemporized   little house among  apple trees the grave gentleman felt himself more  more fascinated  his clever nephew whose fresh demonstrative youth seemed  compendium  experiences so strangely numerous it appeared  him  felix must know  great deal  would like  learn what  thought about some  those things  regards which his own conversation had always been formal but his knowledge vague felix had  confident gayly trenchant way  judging human actions which mr wentworth grew little  little  envy  seemed like criticism made easy forming  opinionsay   person’s conductwas  mr wentworth  good deal like fumbling   lock   key chosen  hazard

consistency  almost asked his nephew’s advice “have you ever entertained  idea  settling   united states”  asked one morning while felix brilliantly plied his brush “my dear uncle” said felix “excuse me if your question makes me smile  little to begin with i have never entertained  idea ideas often entertain me but i am afraid i have never seriously made  plan i know what you  going  say or rather i know what you think  i don’t think you  say itthat this  very frivolous  looseminded  my part so  is but i am made like that i take things  they come  somehow there  always some new thing  follow  last in  second place i should never propose  settle i can’t settle my dear uncle i’m not  settler i know   what strangers  supposed  do here they always settle but i haven’tto answer your questionentertained  idea” “you intend  return  europe  resume your irregular manner  life” mr wentworth inquired “i can’t say i intend but it’s very likely i shall go back  europe after all i am  european i feel that you know it  depend  good deal upon my sister she’s even more   european than i here you know she’s  picture out  her setting and   ‘resuming’ dear uncle i really have never given up my irregular manner  life what  me could  more irregular than this” “than what” asked mr wentworth  his pale gravity “well than everything living   midst  you this way this charming quiet serious family life fraternizing  charlotte  gertrude calling upon twenty young ladies  going out  walk  them sitting  you   evening   piazza  listening   crickets  going  bed  ten o’clock” “your description  very animated” said mr wentworth “but i see nothing improper  what you describe” “neither do i dear uncle it  extremely delightful i shouldn’t like  if   improper i assure you i don’t like improper things though i dare say you think i do” felix went on painting away “i have never accused you  that” “pray don’t” said felix “because you see  bottom i am  terrible philistine” “a philistine” repeated mr wentworth “i mean  one may say  plain godfearing man” mr wentworth looked  him reservedly like  mystified sage  felix continued “i trust i shall enjoy  venerable  venerated old age i mean  live long i can hardly call   plan perhaps but it’s  keen desirea rosy vision i shall   lively perhaps even  frivolous old man” “it  natural” said his uncle sententiously “that one should desire  prolong  agreeable life we have perhaps  selfish indisposition  bring our pleasure   close but i presume”  added “that you expect  marry” “that too dear uncle   hope  desire  vision” said felix it occurred  him   instant  this  possibly  preface   offer   hand  one  mr wentworth’s admirable daughters but   name  decent modesty   proper sense   hard realities  this world felix banished  thought his uncle   incarnation  benevolence certainly but    acceptingmuch more postulatingthe idea   union between  young lady   dowry presumptively brilliant   penniless artist  no prospect  fame there   very long way felix had lately become conscious   luxurious preference   societyif possible unshared  othersof gertrude wentworth but  had relegated this young lady   moment   coldly brilliant category  unattainable possessions she  not  first woman  whom  had entertained  unpractical admiration he had been  love  duchesses  countesses   had made once or twice  perilously near approach  cynicism  declaring   disinterestedness  women had been overrated on  whole  had tempered audacity  modesty    but fair  him now  say explicitly   would have been incapable  taking advantage  his present large allowance  familiarity  make love   younger  his handsome cousins felix had grown up among traditions   light  which such  proceeding looked like  grievous breach  hospitality i have said    always happy   may  counted among  present sources  his happiness   had  regards this matter  his relations  gertrude  deliciously good conscience his own deportment seemed  him suffused   beauty  virtuea form  beauty   admired   same vivacity  which  admired all other forms “i think  if you marry” said mr wentworth presently “it  conduce  your happiness” “sicurissimo” felix exclaimed  then arresting his brush  looked  his uncle   smile “there  something i feel tempted  say  you may i risk it” mr wentworth drew himself up  little “i am very safe i don’t repeat things” but  hoped felix would not risk too much felix  laughing  his answer “it’s odd  hear you telling me how   happy i don’t think you know yourself dear uncle now does  sound brutal” the old man  silent  moment  then   dry dignity  suddenly touched his nephew “we may sometimes point out  road we  unable  follow” “ah don’t tell me you have had any sorrows” felix rejoined “i didn’t suppose it  i didn’t mean  allude  them i simply meant  you all don’t amuse yourselves” “amuse ourselves we  not children” “precisely not you have reached  proper age i  saying   other day  gertrude” felix added “i hope   not indiscreet” “if  was” said mr wentworth   keener irony than felix would have thought him capable of “it  but your way  amusing yourself i am afraid you have never had  trouble” “oh yes i have” felix declared  some spirit “before i knew better but you don’t catch me   again” mr wentworth maintained   while  silence more expressive than  deepdrawn sigh “you have no children”  said  last “don’t tell me” felix exclaimed “that your charming young people   source  grief  you” “i don’t speak  charlotte” and then after  pause mr wentworth continued “i don’t speak  gertrude but i feel considerable anxiety about clifford i  tell you another time” the next time  gave felix  sitting his nephew reminded him   had taken him into his confidence “how  clifford today” felix asked “he  always seemed  me  young man  remarkable discretion indeed   only too discreet  seems  his guard against meas if  thought me rather light company the other day  told his sistergertrude repeated   methat i  always laughing  him if i laugh   simply   impulse  try  inspire him  confidence that   only way i have” “clifford’s situation  no laughing matter” said mr wentworth “it  very peculiar  i suppose you have guessed” “ah you mean his love affair  his cousin” mr wentworth stared blushing  little “i mean his absence  college he  been suspended we have decided not  speak   unless we  asked” “suspended” felix repeated “he  been requested   harvard authorities  absent himself  six months meanwhile   studying  mr brand we think mr brand  help him  least we hope so” “what befell him  college” felix asked “he  too fond  pleasure mr brand certainly  not teach him any  those secrets” “he  too fond  something  which  should not have been fond i suppose   considered  pleasure” felix gave his light laugh “my dear uncle  there any doubt about  being  pleasure c’est de son âge  they say  france” “i should have said rather    vice  later lifeof disappointed old age” felix glanced  his uncle  his lifted eyebrows  then “of what  you speaking”  demanded smiling “of  situation  which clifford  found” “ah   foundhe  caught” “necessarily   caught he couldn’t walk  staggered” “oh” said felix “he drinks i rather suspected that  something i observed  first day i came here i quite agree  you     low taste it’s not  vice   gentleman he ought  give  up” “we hope   good deal  mr brand’s influence” mr wentworth went on “he  talked  him   first and  never touches anything himself” “i  talk  himi  talk  him” felix declared gayly “what  you say  him” asked his uncle  some apprehension felix  some moments answered nothing “do you mean  marry him  his cousin”  asked  last “marry him” echoed mr wentworth “i shouldn’t think his cousin would want  marry him” “you have no understanding then  mrs acton” mr wentworth stared almost blankly “i have never discussed such subjects  her” “i should think  might  time” said felix “lizzie acton  admirably pretty  if clifford  dangerous” “they  not engaged” said mr wentworth “i have no reason  suppose they  engaged” “par exemple” cried felix “a clandestine engagement trust me clifford  i say   charming boy he  incapable  that lizzie acton then would not  jealous  another woman” “i certainly hope not” said  old man   vague sense  jealousy being  even lower vice than  love  liquor “the best thing  clifford then” felix propounded “is  become interested  some clever charming woman” and  paused  his painting and  his elbows  his knees looked  bright communicativeness  his uncle “you see i believe greatly   influence  women living  women helps  make  man  gentleman it  very true clifford  his sisters who  so charming but there should   different sentiment  play   fraternal you know he  lizzie acton but she perhaps  rather immature” “i suspect lizzie  talked  him reasoned  him” said mr wentworth “on  impropriety  getting tipsyon  beauty  temperance that  dreary work   pretty young girl no” felix continued “clifford ought  frequent some agreeable woman who without ever mentioning such unsavory subjects would give him  sense   being very ridiculous   fuddled if  could fall  love  her  little so much  better the thing would operate   cure” “well now what lady should you suggest” asked mr wentworth “there   clever woman under your hand my sister” “your sisterunder my hand” mr wentworth repeated “say  word  clifford tell him   bold he  well disposed already   invited her two or three times  drive but i don’t think  comes  see her give him  hint  cometo come often he  sit there   afternoon  they  talk it  do him good” mr wentworth meditated “you think she  exercise  helpful influence” “she  exercise  civilizingi may call   soberinginfluence a charming clever witty woman always doesespecially if she   little   coquette my dear uncle  society  such women  been half my education if clifford  suspended  you say  college let eugenia  his preceptress” mr wentworth continued thoughtful “you think eugenia   coquette”  asked “what pretty woman  not” felix demanded  turn but this  mr wentworth could   best have been no answer   did not think his niece pretty “with clifford”  young man pursued “eugenia  simply  enough   coquette    little ironical that’s what  needs so you recommend him   nice  her you know the suggestion  come best  you” “do i understand” asked  old man “that i am  suggest  my son  make aa profession ofof affection  madame münster” “yes yesa profession” cried felix sympathetically “but  i understand it madame münster   married woman” “ah” said felix smiling “of course she can’t marry him but she  do what she can” mr wentworth sat  some time  his eyes   floor  last  got up “i don’t think”  said “that i can undertake  recommend my son any such course” and without meeting felix’s surprised glance  broke off his sitting which  not resumed   fortnight felix  very fond   little lake which occupied so many  mr wentworth’s numerous acres    remarkable pine grove which lay upon  further side  it planted upon  steep embankment  haunted   summer breeze the murmur   air   far off treetops had  strange distinctness   almost articulate one afternoon  young man came out  his paintingroom  passed  open door  eugenia’s little salon within   cool dimness  saw his sister dressed  white buried  her armchair  holding  her face  immense bouquet opposite  her sat clifford wentworth twirling his hat he had evidently just presented  bouquet   baroness whose fine eyes  she glanced  him over  big roses  geraniums wore  conversational smile felix standing   threshold   cottage hesitated   moment   whether  should retrace his steps  enter  parlor then  went his way  passed into mr wentworth’s garden that civilizing process  which  had suggested  clifford should  subjected appeared  have come   itself felix  very sure  least  mr wentworth had not adopted his ingenious device  stimulating  young man’s aesthetic consciousness “doubtless  supposes”  said  himself after  conversation   been narrated “that i desire out  fraternal benevolence  procure  eugenia  amusement   flirtationor   probably calls it  intriguewith  too susceptible clifford it must  admittedand i have noticed  beforethat nothing exceeds  license occasionally taken   imagination  very rigid people” felix  his own side had  course said nothing  clifford but  had observed  eugenia  mr wentworth  much mortified  his son’s low tastes “we ought  do something  help them after all their kindness  us”  had added “encourage clifford  come  see you  inspire him   taste  conversation that  supplant  other which only comes  his puerility  his not taking his position   worldthat   rich young man  ancient stockseriously enough make him  little more serious even if  makes love  you   no great matter” “i am  offer myself   superior form  intoxicationa substitute   brandy bottle eh” asked  baroness “truly  this country one comes  strange uses” but she had not positively declined  undertake clifford’s higher education  felix who had not thought   matter again being haunted  visions  more personal profit now reflected   work  redemption had fairly begun the idea  prospect had seemed   happiest but  operation  made him  trifle uneasy “what if eugeniawhat if eugenia”he asked himself softly  question dying away  his sense  eugenia’s undetermined capacity but before felix had time either  accept or  reject  admonition even  this vague form  saw robert acton turn out  mr wentworth’s enclosure   distant gate  come toward  cottage   orchard acton had evidently walked  his own house along  shady byway   intending  pay  visit  madame münster felix watched him  moment then  turned away acton could  left  play  part  providence  interruptif interruption  neededclifford’s entanglement  eugenia felix passed through  garden toward  house  toward  postern gate which opened upon  path leading across  fields beside  little wood   lake he stopped  looked up   house his eyes rested more particularly upon  certain open window   shady side presently gertrude appeared there looking out into  summer light he took off his hat  her  bade her goodday  remarked    going  row across  pond  begged  she would do him  honor  accompany him she looked  him  moment then without saying anything she turned away but she soon reappeared below  one  those quaint  charming leghorn

well  feel it felix  gertrude sat down   rustcolored carpet  pineneedles  talked  many things felix spoke  last   course  talk  his going away    first time  had alluded  it “you  going away” said gertrude looking  him “some daywhen  leaves begin  fall you know i can’t stay forever” gertrude transferred her eyes   outer prospect  then after  pause she said “i shall never see you again” “why not” asked felix “we shall probably both survive my departure” but gertrude only repeated “i shall never see you again i shall never hear  you” she went on “i shall know nothing about you i knew nothing about you before      same again” “i knew nothing about you then unfortunately” said felix “but now i shall write  you” “don’t write  me i shall not answer you” gertrude declared “i should  course burn your letters” said felix gertrude looked  him again “burn my letters you sometimes say strange things” “they  not strange  themselves”  young man answered “they  only strange  said  you you  come  europe” “with whom shall i come” she asked this question simply she  very much  earnest felix  interested  her earnestness  some moments  hesitated “you can’t tell me that” she pursued “you can’t say  i shall go  my father  my sister you don’t believe that” “i shall keep your letters” said felix presently  all answer “i never write i don’t know how  write” gertrude  some time said nothing more  her companion   looked  her wished  had not been “disloyal”  make love   daughter   old gentleman who had offered one hospitality the afternoon waned  shadows stretched themselves   light grew deeper   western sky two persons appeared   opposite side   lake coming   house  crossing  meadow “it  charlotte  mr brand” said gertrude “they  coming over here” but charlotte  mr brand only came down   edge   water  stood there looking across they made no motion  enter  boat  felix had left   mooringplace felix waved his hat  them   too far  call they made no visible response  they presently turned away  walked along  shore “mr brand  not demonstrative” said felix “he  never demonstrative  me he sits silent  his chin  his hand looking  me sometimes  looks away your father tells me   so eloquent  i should like  hear him talk he looks like such  noble young man but  me   never talk and yet i am so fond  listening  brilliant imagery” “he  very eloquent” said gertrude “but   no brilliant imagery i have heard him talk  great deal i knew  when they saw us they would not come over here” “ah   making la cour  they say  your sister they desire   alone” “no” said gertrude gravely “they have no such reason    being alone” “but why doesn’t  make la cour  charlotte” felix inquired “she  so pretty so gentle so good” gertrude glanced  him  then she looked   distantlyseen couple they  discussing mr brand  charlotte  walking side  side they might have been  pair  lovers  yet they might not “they think i should not  here” said gertrude “with me i thought you didn’t have those ideas” “you don’t understand there   great many things you don’t understand” “i understand my stupidity but why then do not charlotte  mr brand who   elder sister   clergyman  free  walk about together come over  make me wiser  breaking up  unlawful interview into which i have lured you” “that   last thing they would do” said gertrude felix stared  her  moment  his lifted eyebrows “je n’y comprends rien”  exclaimed then his eyes followed   while  retreating figures  this critical pair “you may say what you please”  declared “it  evident  me  your sister  not indifferent  her clever companion it  agreeable  her   walking there  him i can see   here” and   excitement  observation felix rose  his feet gertrude rose also but she made no attempt  emulate her companion’s discovery she looked rather  another direction felix’s words had struck her but  certain delicacy checked her “she  certainly not indifferent  mr brand she   highest opinion  him” “one can see itone can see it” said felix   tone  amused contemplation  his head  one side gertrude turned her back   opposite shore   disagreeable  her  look but she hoped felix would say something more “ah they have wandered away into  wood”  added gertrude turned round again “she  not  love  him” she said  seemed her duty  say that “then    love  her or if   not  ought  be she  such  perfect little woman  her kind she reminds me   pair  oldfashioned silver sugartongs you know i am very fond  sugar and she  very nice  mr brand i have noticed that very gentle  gracious” gertrude reflected  moment then she took  great resolution “she wants him  marry me” she said “so  course she  nice” felix’s eyebrows rose higher than ever “to marry you ah ah this  interesting and you think one must  very nice   man  induce him  do that” gertrude had turned  little pale but she went on “mr brand wants  himself” felix folded his arms  stood looking  her “i seei see”  said quickly “why did you never tell me this before” “it  disagreeable  me  speak   even now i wished simply  explain  you about charlotte” “you don’t wish  marry mr brand then” “no” said gertrude gravely “and does your father wish it” “very much” “and you don’t like himyou have refused him” “i don’t wish  marry him” “your father  sister think you ought to eh” “it   long story” said gertrude “they think there  good reasons i can’t explain it they think i have obligations   i have encouraged him” felix smiled  her  if she had been telling him  amusing story about someone else “i can’t tell you how this interests me”  said “now you don’t recognize these reasonsthese obligations” “i am not sure   not easy” and she picked up her parasol  turned away  if  descend  slope “tell me this” felix went on going  her “are you likely  give into let them persuade you” gertrude looked  him   serious face  she had constantly worn  opposition  his almost eager smile “i shall never marry mr brand” she said “i see” felix rejoined and they slowly descended  hill together saying nothing till they reached  margin   pond “it  your own affair”  then resumed “but do you know i am not altogether glad if   settled  you   marry mr brand i should take  certain comfort   arrangement i should feel more free i have no right  make love  you myself eh” and  paused lightly pressing his argument upon her “none whatever” replied gertrude quicklytoo quickly “your father would never hear  it i haven’t  penny mr brand  course  property  his own eh” “i believe   some property but   nothing  do  it” “with you  course not but  your father  sister  must have so  i say if this  settled i should feel more  liberty” “more  liberty” gertrude repeated “please unfasten  boat” felix untwisted  rope  stood holding it “i should  able  say things  you  i can’t give myself  pleasure  saying now”  went on “i could tell you how much i admire you without seeming  pretend   which i have no right  pretend to i should make violent love  you”  added laughing “if i thought you  so placed  not   offended  it” “you mean if i  engaged  another man that  strange reasoning” gertrude exclaimed “in  case you would not take me seriously” “i take everyone seriously” said gertrude and without his help she stepped lightly into  boat felix took up  oars  sent  forward “ah this  what you have been thinking about it seemed  me you had something  your mind i wish very much”  added “that you would tell me some  these socalled reasonsthese obligations” “they  not real reasonsgood reasons” said gertrude looking   pink  yellow gleams   water “i can understand that because  handsome girl  had  spark  coquetry   no reason” “if you mean me it’s not that i have not done that” “it  something  troubles you  any rate” said felix “not so much   used to” gertrude rejoined he looked  her smiling always “that  not saying much eh” but she only rested her eyes very gravely   lighted water she seemed  him   trying  hide  signs   trouble  which she had just told him felix felt  all times much  same impulse  dissipate visible melancholy   good housewife feels  brush away dust there  something  wished  brush away now suddenly  stopped rowing  poised his oars “why should mr brand have addressed himself  you  not  your sister”  asked “i am sure she would listen  him” gertrude  her family  thought capable   good deal  levity but her levity had never gone so far  this it moved her greatly however  hear felix say    sure  something so that raising her eyes toward him she tried intently  some moments  conjure up this wonderful image   loveaffair between her own sister  her own suitor we know  gertrude had  imaginative mind so    not impossible  this effort should have been partially successful but she only murmured “ah felix ah felix” “why shouldn’t they marry try  make them marry” cried felix “try  make them” “turn  tables  them then they  leave you alone i  help you  far  i can” gertrude’s heart began  beat she  greatly excited she had never had anything so interesting proposed  her before felix had begun  row again   now sent  boat home  long strokes “i believe she does care  him” said gertrude after they had disembarked “of course she does  we  marry them off it  make them happy   make everyone happy we shall have  wedding  i  write  epithalamium” “it seems  if  would make me happy” said gertrude “to get rid  mr brand eh to recover your liberty” gertrude walked on “to see my sister married  so good  man” felix gave his light laugh “you always put things  those grounds you  never say anything  yourself you  all so afraid here  being selfish i don’t think you know how”  went on “let me show you it  make me happy  myself   just  reverse  what i told you  while ago after that when i make love  you you  have  think i mean it” “i shall never think you mean anything” said gertrude “you  too fantastic” “ah” cried felix “that’s  license  say everything gertrude i adore you” chapter viii charlotte  mr brand had not returned when they reached  house but  baroness had come  tea  robert acton also who now regularly asked   place  this generous repast or made his appearance later   evening clifford wentworth  his juvenile growl remarked upon it “you  always coming  tea nowadays robert”  said “i should think you had drunk enough tea  china” “since when  mr acton more frequent” asked  baroness “since you came” said clifford “it seems  if you   kind  attraction” “i suppose i am  curiosity” said  baroness “give me time  i  make you  salon” “it would fall  pieces after you go” exclaimed acton “don’t talk about her going   familiar way” clifford said “it makes me feel gloomy” mr wentworth glanced  his son  taking note  these words wondered if felix had been teaching him according   programme  had sketched out  make love   wife   german prince charlotte came  late  mr brand but gertrude  whom  least felix had taught something looked  vain  her face   traces   guilty passion mr brand sat down  gertrude  she presently asked him why they had not crossed  pond  join felix  herself “it  cruel  you  ask me that”  answered very softly he had  large morsel  cake before him but  fingered  without eating it “i sometimes think you  growing cruel”  added gertrude said nothing she  afraid  speak there   kind  rage  her heart she felt  if she could easily persuade herself  she  persecuted she said  herself    quite right  she should not allow him  make her believe she  wrong she thought  what felix had said  her she wished indeed mr brand would marry charlotte she looked away  him  spoke no more mr brand ended  eating his cake while felix sat opposite describing  mr wentworth  students’ duels  heidelberg after tea they all dispersed themselves  usual upon  piazza    garden  mr brand drew near  gertrude again “i didn’t come  you this afternoon because you  not alone”  began “because you    newer friend” “felix he   old friend  this time” mr brand looked   ground  some moments “i thought i  prepared  hear you speak   way”  resumed “but i find  very painful” “i don’t see what else i can say” said gertrude mr brand walked beside her   while  silence gertrude wished  would go away “he  certainly very accomplished but i think i ought  advise you” “to advise me” “i think i know your nature” “i think you don’t” said gertrude   soft laugh “you make yourself out worse than you areto please him” mr brand said gently “worseto please him what do you mean” asked gertrude stopping mr brand stopped also    same soft straightforwardness “he doesn’t care   things you care forthe great questions  life” gertrude  her eyes  his shook her head “i don’t care   great questions  life they  much beyond me” “there   time when you didn’t say that” said mr brand “oh” rejoined gertrude “i think you made me talk  great deal  nonsense and  depends” she added “upon what you call  great questions  life there  some things i care for” “are they  things you talk about  your cousin” “you should not say things  me against my cousin mr brand” said gertrude “that  dishonorable” he listened  this respectfully then  answered   little vibration   voice “i should  very sorry  do anything dishonorable but i don’t see why   dishonorable  say  your cousin  frivolous” “go  say   himself” “i think  would admit it” said mr brand “that   tone  would take he would not  ashamed  it” “then i am not ashamed  it” gertrude declared “that  probably what i like him for i am frivolous myself” “you  trying  i said just now  lower yourself” “i am trying  once   natural” cried gertrude passionately “i have been pretending all my life i have been dishonest   you  have made me so” mr brand stood gazing  her  she went on “why shouldn’t i  frivolous if i want one   right   frivolous if it’s one’s nature no i don’t care   great questions i care  pleasurefor amusement perhaps i am fond  wicked things   very possible” mr brand remained staring   even  little pale  if  had been frightened “i don’t think you know what you  saying”  exclaimed “perhaps not perhaps i am talking nonsense but   only  you  i talk nonsense i never do so  my cousin” “i  speak  you again when you  less excited” said mr brand “i am always excited when you speak  me i must tell you thateven if  prevents you altogether  future your speaking  me irritates me with my cousin   very different that seems quiet  natural” he looked  her  then  looked away   kind  helpless distress   dusky garden   faint summer stars after which suddenly turning back “gertrude gertrude”  softly groaned “am i really losing you” she  touchedshe  pained but  had already occurred  her  she might do something better than say so it would not have alleviated her companion’s distress  perceive just then whence she had sympathetically borrowed this ingenuity “i am not sorry  you” gertrude said “for  paying so much attention  me you  following  shadowyou  wasting something precious there  something else you might have  you don’t look atsomething better than i am that   reality” and then  intention she looked  him  tried  smile  little he thought this smile  hers very strange but she turned away  left him she wandered about alone   garden wondering what mr brand would make  her words which  had been  singular pleasure  her  utter shortly after passing  front   house she saw   distance two persons standing near  garden gate it  mr brand going away  bidding goodnight  charlotte who had walked down  him   house gertrude saw   parting  prolonged then she turned her back upon it she had not gone very far however when she heard her sister slowly following her she neither turned round nor waited  her she knew what charlotte  going  say charlotte who  last overtook her  fact presently began she had passed her arm into gertrude’s “will you listen  me dear if i say something very particular” “i know what you  going  say” said gertrude “mr brand feels very badly” “oh gertrude how can you treat him so” charlotte demanded and  her sister made no answer she added “after all   done  you” “what   done  me” “i wonder you can ask gertrude he  helped you so you told me so yourself  great many times you told me   helped you  struggle  youryour peculiarities you told me   had taught you how  govern your temper” for  moment gertrude said nothing then “was my temper very bad” she asked “i am not accusing you gertrude” said charlotte “what  you doing then” her sister demanded   short laugh “i am pleading  mr brandreminding you  all you owe him” “i have given  all back” said gertrude still  her little laugh “he can take back  virtue  imparted i want   wicked again” her sister made her stop   path  fixed upon her   darkness  sweet reproachful gaze “if you talk this way i shall almost believe it think  all we owe mr brand think  how   always expected something  you think how much   been  us think  his beautiful influence upon clifford” “he  very good” said gertrude looking  her sister “i know   very good but  shouldn’t speak against felix” “felix  good” charlotte answered softly but promptly “felix  very wonderful only   so different mr brand  much nearer  us i should never think  going  felix   troublewith  question mr brand  much more  us gertrude” “he  veryvery good” gertrude repeated “he  more  you yes much more charlotte” she added suddenly “you   love  him” “oh gertrude” cried poor charlotte  her sister saw her blushing   darkness gertrude put her arm round her “i wish  would marry you” she went on charlotte shook herself free “you must not say such things” she exclaimed beneath her breath “you like him more than you say   likes you more than  knows” “this  very cruel  you” charlotte wentworth murmured but if   cruel gertrude continued pitiless “not if it’s true” she answered “i wish  would marry you” “please don’t say that” “i mean  tell him so” said gertrude “oh gertrude gertrude” her sister almost moaned “yes if  speaks  me again about myself i  say ‘why don’t you marry charlotte she’s  thousand times better than i’” “you are wicked you are changed” cried her sister “if you don’t like  you can prevent it” said gertrude “you can prevent   keeping him  speaking  me” and  this she walked away very conscious  what she had done measuring   finding  certain joy   quickened sense  freedom  it mr wentworth  rather wide   mark  suspecting  clifford had begun  pay unscrupulous compliments  his brilliant cousin   young man had really more scruples than  received credit   his family he had  certain transparent shamefacedness which   itself  proof    not  his ease

he believedalthough  must  added   had not quite  courage  declare itin  doctrine  wild oats  thought   useful preventive  superfluous fears if mr wentworth  charlotte  mr brand would only apply   clifford’s case they would  happier  acton thought   pity they should not  happier they took  boy’s misdemeanors too much  heart they talked  him too solemnly they frightened  bewildered him of course there   great standard  morality which forbade   man should get tipsy play  billiards  money or cultivate his sensual consciousness but what fear  there  poor clifford  going  run  tilt  any great standard it had however never occurred  acton  dedicate  baroness münster   redemption   refractory collegian the instrument here would have seemed  him quite too complex   operation felix   other

intimating she had come four thousand miles  seek her fortune    not   supposed  after this great effort she could neglect any apparent aid  advancement it  my misfortune   attempting  describe

robert acton but  she had afterwards remembered   prudent archer  always  second bowstring eugenia   woman  finelymingled motive  her intentions  never sensibly gross she had  sort  aesthetic ideal  clifford which seemed  her  disinterested reason  taking him  hand it  very well   freshcolored young gentleman   ingenuous but clifford really  crude with such  pretty face  ought  have prettier manners she would teach him that   beautiful name  expectation   large property and  they said  europe  social position  only son should know how  carry himself once clifford had begun  come  see her  himself   himself  came very often he hardly knew why  should come  saw her almost every evening  his father’s house  had nothing particular  say  her she  not  young girl  fellows  his age called only upon young girls he exaggerated her age she seemed  him  old woman   happy   baroness  all her intelligence  incapable  guessing this but gradually  struck clifford  visiting old women might be if not  natural  least  they say  some articles  diet  acquired taste the baroness  certainly  very amusing old woman she talked  him  no ladyand indeed no gentlemanhad ever talked  him before “you should go  europe  make  tour” she said  him one afternoon “of course  leaving college you  go” “i don’t want  go” clifford declared “i know some fellows who have been  europe they say you can have better fun here” “that depends it depends upon your idea  fun your friends probably  not introduced” “introduced” clifford demanded “they had no opportunity  going into society they formed no relations” this  one   certain number  words   baroness often pronounced   french manner “they went   ball  paris i know that” said clifford “ah there  balls  balls especially  paris no you must go you know   not  thing  which you can dispense yourself you need it” “oh i’m very well” said clifford “i’m not sick” “i don’t mean  your health my poor child i mean  your manners” “i haven’t got any manners” growled clifford “precisely you don’t mind my assenting  that eh” asked  baroness   smile “you must go  europe  get  few you can get them better there it   pity you might not have come while i  living inin germany i would have introduced you i had  charming little circle you would perhaps have been rather young but  younger one begins i think  better now  any rate you have no time  lose  when i return you must immediately come  me” all this  clifford’s apprehension   great mixturehis beginning young eugenia’s return  europe his being introduced  her charming little circle what    begin  what  her little circle his ideas about her marriage had  good deal  vagueness but they   so far definite    felt     matter not   freely mentioned he sat  looked all round  room  supposed she  alluding  some way  her marriage “oh i don’t want  go  germany”  said  seemed  him  most convenient thing  say she looked  him  while smiling  her lips but not  her eyes “you have scruples” she asked “scruples” said clifford “you young people here  very singular one doesn’t know where  expect you when you  not extremely improper you  so terribly proper i dare say you think that owing  my irregular marriage i live  loose people you  never more mistaken i have been all  more particular” “oh no” said clifford honestly distressed “i never thought such  thing  that” “are you very sure i am convinced  your father does  your sisters they say  each other  here i am  my good behavior but  over theremarried   left handi associate  light women” “oh no” cried clifford energetically “they don’t say such things    each other” “if they think them they had better say them”  baroness rejoined “then they can  contradicted please contradict  whenever you hear it  don’t  afraid  coming  see me  account   company i keep i have  honor  knowing more distinguished men my poor child than you  likely  see   lifetime i see very few women but those  women  rank so my dear young puritan you needn’t  afraid i

school than  others trust me clifford  i  prove   you”  baroness continued while she made  agreeable reflection  she could not  least  accused  perverting her young kinsman “so if you ever fall among thieves don’t go about saying i sent you  them” clifford thought  so comical   should knowin spite  her figurative languagewhat she meant   she should mean what  knew   could hardly help laughing  little although  tried hard “oh no oh no”  murmured “laugh out laugh out if i amuse you” cried  baroness “i am here  that” and clifford thought her  very amusing person indeed “but remember” she said  this occasion “that you  comingnext yearto pay me  visit over there” about  week afterwards she said  him pointblank “are you seriously making love  your little cousin” “seriously making love”these words  madame münster’s lips had  clifford’s sense  portentous  embarrassing sound  hesitated about assenting lest  should commit himself  more than  understood “well i shouldn’t say  if i was”  exclaimed “why wouldn’t you say it”  baroness demanded “those things ought   known” “i don’t care whether   known or not” clifford rejoined “but i don’t want people looking  me” “a young man  your importance ought  learn  bear observationto carry himself  if   quite indifferent  it i won’t say exactly unconscious”  baroness explained “no  must seem  know   observed   think  natural  should be but  must appear perfectly used  it now you haven’t that clifford you haven’t   all you must have that you know don’t tell me you  not  young man  importance” eugenia added “don’t say anything so flat  that” “oh no you don’t catch me saying that” cried clifford “yes you must come  germany” madame münster continued “i  show you how people can  talked about  yet not seem  know it you   talked about  course  me    said you  my lover i  show you how little one may mind thathow little i shall mind it” clifford sat staring blushing  laughing “i shall mind   good deal”  declared “ah not too much you know  would  uncivil but i give you leave  mind   little especially if you have  passion  miss acton voyons  regards that you either have or you have not it  very simple  say it” “i don’t see why you want  know” said clifford “you ought  want me  know if one  arranging  marriage one tells one’s friends” “oh i’m not arranging anything” said clifford “you don’t intend  marry your cousin” “well i expect i shall do  i choose” the baroness leaned her head upon  back  her chair  closed her eyes  if she  tired then opening them again “your cousin  very charming” she said “she   prettiest girl  this place” clifford rejoined “‘in this place’  saying little she would  charming anywhere i am afraid you  entangled” “oh no i’m not entangled” “are you engaged at your age    same thing” clifford looked   baroness  some audacity “will you tell no one” “if it’s  sacred  thatno” “well thenwe  not” said clifford “that’s  great secretthat you  not eh” asked  baroness   quick laugh “i am very glad  hear it you  altogether too young a young man  your position must choose  compare  must see  world first depend upon it” she added “you should not settle  matter before you have come abroad  paid me  visit there  several things i should like  call your attention  first” “well i am rather afraid   visit” said clifford “it seems  me    rather like going  school again” the baroness looked  him  moment “my dear child” she said “there  no agreeable man who  not  some moment been  school   clever womanprobably  little older than himself and you must  thankful when you get your instructions gratis with me you would get  gratis” the next day clifford told lizzie acton   baroness thought her  most charming girl she had ever seen lizzie shook her head “no she doesn’t” she said “do you think everything she says” asked clifford “is   taken  opposite way” “i think  is” said lizzie clifford  going  remark   this case  baroness must desire greatly  bring about  marriage between mr clifford wentworth  miss elizabeth acton but  resolved   whole  suppress this observation chapter ix it seemed  robert acton after eugenia had come  his house  something had passed between them which made them

whatever else  might imply   narrator  these incidents  not obliged   more definite he returned home rapidly and arriving   afternoon lost  little time  possible  joining  familiar circle  mr wentworth’s on reaching  house however  found  piazzas empty the doors  windows  open  their emptiness  made clear   shafts  lamplight   parlors entering  house  found mr wentworth sitting alone  one  these apartments engaged   perusal   north american review after they had exchanged greetings  his cousin had made discreet inquiry about his journey acton asked what had become  mr wentworth’s companions “they  scattered about amusing themselves  usual” said  old man “i saw charlotte  short time since seated  mr brand upon  piazza they  conversing  their customary animation i suppose they have joined her sister who   hundredth time  doing  honors   garden  her foreign cousin” “i suppose you mean felix” said acton and  mr wentworth’s assenting  said “and  others” “your sister  not come this evening you must have seen her  home” said mr wentworth “yes i proposed  her  come she declined” “lizzie i suppose  expecting  visitor” said  old man   kind  solemn slyness “if she  expecting clifford  had not turned up” mr wentworth  this intelligence closed  north american review  remarked   had understood clifford  say    going  see his cousin privately  reflected  if lizzie acton had had no news  his son clifford must have gone  boston   evening  unnatural course   summer night especially when accompanied  disingenuous representations “you must remember    two cousins” said acton laughing and then coming   point “if lizzie  not here”  added “neither apparently   baroness” mr wentworth stared  moment  remembered  queer proposition  felix’s for  moment  did not know whether   not   wished  clifford after all might have gone  boston “the baroness  not honored us tonight”  said “she  not come over  three days” “is she ill” acton asked “no i have been  see her” “what   matter  her” “well” said mr wentworth “i infer she  tired  us” acton pretended  sit down but   restless  found  impossible  talk  mr wentworth at  end  ten minutes  took up his hat  said   thought  would “go off” it  very late   ten o’clock his quietfaced kinsman looked  him  moment “are you going home”  asked acton hesitated  then answered   had proposed  go over  take  look   baroness “well you  honest  least” said mr wentworth sadly “so  you if you come  that” cried acton laughing “why shouldn’t i  honest” the old man opened  north american again  read  few lines “if we have ever had any virtue among us we had better keep hold   now”  said he  not quoting “we have  baroness among us” said acton “that’s what we must keep hold of” he  too impatient  see madame münster again  wonder what mr wentworth  talking about nevertheless after  had passed out   house  traversed  garden   little piece  road  separated him  eugenia’s provisional residence  stopped  moment outside he stood  her little garden  long window  her parlor  open   could see  white curtains   lamplight shining through them swaying softly   fro   warm night wind there   sort  excitement   idea  seeing madame münster again  became aware  his heart  beating rather faster than usual it  this  made him stop   halfamused surprise but   moment  went along  piazza and approaching  open window tapped upon  lintel  his stick he could see  baroness within she  standing   middle   room she came   window  pulled aside  curtain then she stood looking  him  moment she  not smiling she seemed serious “mais entrez donc” she said  last acton passed  across  windowsill  wondered   instant what   matter  her but  next moment she had begun  smile  had put out her hand “better late than never” she said “it  very kind  you  come  this hour” “i have just returned  my journey” said acton “ah very kind very kind” she repeated looking about her where  sit “i went first   other house” acton continued “i expected  find you there” she had sunk into her usual chair but she got up again  began  move about  room acton had laid down his hat  stick   looking  her conscious  there   fact  great charm  seeing her again “i don’t know whether i ought  tell you  sit down” she said “it  too late  begin  visit” “it’s too early  end one” acton declared “and we needn’t mind  beginning” she looked  him again and after  moment dropped once more into her low chair while  took  place near her “we    middle then” she asked “was  where we  when you went away no i haven’t been   other house” “not yesterday nor  day before eh” “i don’t know how many days  is” “you  tired  it” said acton she leaned back  her chair her arms  folded “that   terrible accusation but i have not  courage  defend myself” “i am not attacking you” said acton “i expected something  this kind” “it’s  proof  extreme intelligence i hope you enjoyed your journey” “not  all” acton declared “i would much rather have been here  you” “now you are attacking me” said  baroness “you  contrasting my inconstancy  your own fidelity” “i confess i never get tired  people i like” “ah you  not  poor wicked foreign woman  irritable nerves   sophisticated mind” “something  happened  you since i went away” said acton changing his place “your going awaythat  what  happened  me” “do you mean  say  you have missed me”  asked “if i had meant  say it  would not  worth your making  note of i am very dishonest  my compliments  worthless” acton  silent  some moments “you have broken down”  said  last madame münster left her chair  began  move about “only   moment i shall pull myself together again” “you had better not take  too hard if you  bored you needn’t  afraid  say soto me  least” “you shouldn’t say such things  that”  baroness answered “you should encourage me” “i admire your patience   encouraging” “you shouldn’t even say that when you talk  my patience you  disloyal  your own people patience implies suffering  what have i had  suffer” “oh not hunger not unkindness certainly” said acton laughing “nevertheless we all admire your patience” “you all detest me” cried  baroness   sudden vehemence turning her back toward him “you make  hard” said acton getting up “for  man  say something tender  you” this evening there  something particularly striking  touching about her  unwonted softness   look  suppressed emotion he felt himself suddenly appreciating  fact  she had behaved very well she had come  this quiet corner   world under  weight   cruel indignity  she had been so gracefully modestly thankful   rest she found there she had joined  simple circle over  way she had mingled   plain provincial talk she had shared  meagre  savorless pleasures she had set herself  task  she had rigidly performed it she had conformed   angular conditions  new england life  she had had  tact  pluck  carry  off  if she liked them acton felt  more downright need than  had ever felt before  tell her   admired her   she struck him   very superior woman all along hitherto  had been  his guard  her  had been cautious observant suspicious but now  certain light tumult  his blood seemed  tell him   finer degree  confidence  this charming woman would   own reward “we don’t detest you”  went on “i don’t know what you mean at any rate i speak  myself i don’t know anything about  others very likely you detest them   dull life they make you lead really  would give me  sort  pleasure  hear you say so” eugenia had been looking   door   other side   room now she slowly turned her eyes toward robert acton “what can   motive” she asked “of  man like youan honest man  galant hommein saying so base  thing  that” “does  sound very base” asked acton candidly “i suppose  does  i thank you  telling me so of course i don’t mean  literally” the baroness stood looking  him “how do you mean it” she asked this question  difficult  answer  acton feeling  least bit foolish walked   open window  looked out he stood there thinking  moment  then  turned back “you know  document  you   send  germany”  said “you called  your ‘renunciation’ did you ever send it” madame münster’s eyes expanded she looked very grave “what  singular answer  my question” “oh  isn’t  answer” said acton “i have wished  ask you many times i thought  probable you would tell me yourself the question  my part seems abrupt now but  would  abrupt  any time” the baroness  silent  moment  then “i think i have told you too much” she said this declaration appeared  acton  have  certain force  had indeed  sense  asking more  her than  offered her he returned   window  watched   moment  little star  twinkled through  lattice   piazza there   any rate offers enough  could make perhaps  had hitherto not been sufficiently explicit  doing so “i wish you would ask something  me”  presently said “is there nothing i can do  you if you can’t stand this dull life any more let me amuse you” the baroness had sunk once more into  chair  she had taken up  fan which she held  both hands  her mouth over  top   fan her eyes  fixed  him “you  very strange tonight” she said   little laugh “i  do anything   world”  rejoined standing  front  her “shouldn’t you like  travel about  see something   country won’t you go  niagara you ought  see niagara you know” “with you do you mean” “i should  delighted  take you” “you alone” acton looked  her smiling  yet   serious air “well yes we might go alone”  said “if you  not what you are” she answered “i should feel insulted” “how do you meanwhat i am” “if you  one   gentlemen i have been used  all my life if you  not  queer bostonian” “if  gentlemen you have been used  have taught you  expect insults” said acton “i am glad i am what i am you had much better come  niagara” “if you wish  ‘amuse’ me”  baroness declared “you need go  no further expense you amuse me very effectually” he sat down opposite  her she still held her fan up  her face  her eyes only showing above it there   moment’s silence  then  said returning  his former question “have you sent  document  germany” again there   moment’s silence the expressive eyes  madame münster seemed however half  break it “i  tell youat niagara” she said she had hardly spoken when  door   further end   room openedthe door upon which some minutes previous eugenia had fixed her gaze clifford wentworth stood there blushing  looking rather awkward the baroness rose quickly  acton more slowly did  same clifford gave him no greeting   looking  eugenia “ah you  here” exclaimed acton “he   felix’s studio” said madame münster “he wanted  see his sketches” clifford looked  robert acton but said nothing  only fanned himself  his hat “you chose  bad moment” said acton “you hadn’t much light” “i hadn’t any” said clifford laughing “your candle went out” eugenia asked “you should have come back here  lighted  again” clifford looked  her  moment “so i havecome back but i have left  candle” eugenia turned away “you  very stupid my poor boy you had better go home” “well” said clifford “goodnight” “haven’t you  word  throw   man when   safely returned   dangerous journey” acton asked “how do you do” said clifford “i thoughti thought you were”   paused looking   baroness again “you thought i   newport eh so i wasthis morning” “goodnight clever child” said madame münster over her shoulder clifford stared  hernot  all like  clever child  then  one  his little facetious growls took his departure “what   matter  him” asked acton when   gone “he seemed rather   muddle” eugenia who  near  window glanced out listening  moment “the matterthe matter”she answered “but you don’t say such things here” “if you mean   had been drinking  little you can say that” “he doesn’t drink any more i have cured him and  returnhe’s  love  me” it  acton’s turn  stare he instantly thought  his sister but  said nothing about her he began  laugh “i don’t wonder  his passion but i wonder  his forsaking your society    your brother’s paintbrushes” eugenia  silent  little “he had not been   studio i invented    moment” “invented it for what purpose” “he   idea  being romantic he  adopted  habit  coming  see me  midnightpassing only through  orchard  through felix’s paintingroom which   door opening  way it seems  amuse him” added eugenia   little laugh acton felt more surprise than  confessed to  this   new view  clifford whose irregularities had hitherto been quite without  romantic element he tried  laugh again but  felt rather too serious  after  moment’s hesitation his seriousness explained itself “i hope you don’t encourage him”  said “he must not  inconstant  poor lizzie” “to your sister” “you know they  decidedly intimate” said acton “ah” cried eugenia smiling “has shehas she” “i don’t know” acton interrupted “what she has but i always supposed  clifford had  desire  make himself agreeable  her” “ah par exemple”  baroness went on “the little monster the next time  becomes sentimental i  him tell   ought   ashamed  himself” acton  silent  moment “you had better say nothing about it” “i had told him  much already  general grounds” said  baroness “but  this country you know  relations  young people  so extraordinary  one  quite  sea they  not engaged when you would quite say they ought  be take charlotte wentworth  instance   young ecclesiastic if i  her father i should insist upon his marrying her but  appears   thought there  no urgency on  other hand you suddenly learn   boy  twenty   little girl who  still  her governessyour sister  no governess well then who  never away  her mammaa young couple  short between whom you have noticed nothing beyond  exchange   childish pleasantries characteristic  their age    point  setting up  man  wife” the baroness spoke   certain exaggerated volubility which   contrast   languid grace  had characterized her manner before clifford made his appearance it seemed  acton  there   spark  irritation  her eyea note  irony as when she spoke  lizzie being never away  her mother  her voice if madame münster  irritated robert acton  vaguely mystified she began  move about  room again   looked  her without saying anything presently she took out her watch and glancing  it declared    three o’clock   morning    must go “i have not been here  hour”  said “and they  still sitting up   other house you can see  lights your brother  not come in” “oh   other house” cried eugenia “they  terrible people i don’t know what they may do over there i am  quiet little humdrum woman i have rigid rules  i keep them one  them  not  have visitors   small hoursespecially clever men like you so goodnight” decidedly  baroness  incisive  though acton bade her goodnight  departed   still  good deal mystified the next day clifford wentworth came  see lizzie  acton who   home  saw him pass through  garden took note   circumstance he had  natural desire  make  tally  madame münster’s account  clifford’s disaffection but his ingenuity finding itself unequal   task resolved  last  ask help   young man’s candor he waited till  saw him going away  then  went out  overtook him   grounds “i wish very much you would answer me  question” acton said “what  you doing last night  madame münster’s” clifford began  laugh   blush  no means like  young man   romantic secret “what did she tell you”  asked “that  exactly what i don’t want  say” “well i want  tell you  same” said clifford “and unless i know  perhaps i can’t” they had stopped   garden path acton looked hard  his rosy young kinsman “she said she couldn’t fancy what had got into you you appeared  have taken  violent dislike  her” clifford stared looking  little alarmed “oh come”  growled “you don’t mean that” “and  whenfor common civility’s sakeyou came occasionally   house you left her alone  spent your time  felix’s studio under pretext  looking  his sketches” “oh come” growled clifford again “did you ever know me  tell  untruth” “yes lots  them” said clifford seeing  opening out   discussion  his sarcastic powers “well”  presently added “i thought you  my father” “you knew someone  there” “we heard you coming in” acton meditated “you had been   baroness then” “i    parlor we heard your step outside i thought   my father” “and  that” asked acton “you ran away” “she told me  goto go out   studio” acton meditated more intensely if there had been  chair  hand  would have sat down “why should she wish you not  meet your father” “well” said clifford “father doesn’t like  see me there” acton looked askance  his companion  forbore  make any comment upon this assertion “has  said so”  asked “to  baroness” “well i hope not” said clifford “he hasn’t said soin so many wordsto me but i know  worries him  i want  stop worrying him the baroness knows it  she wants me  stop too” “to stop coming  see her” “i don’t know about that but  stop worrying father eugenia knows everything” clifford added   air  knowingness  his own “ah” said acton interrogatively “eugenia knows everything” “she knew   not father coming in” “then why did you go” clifford blushed  laughed afresh “well i  afraid  was and besides she told me  go  any rate” “did she think   i” acton asked “she didn’t say so” again robert acton reflected “but you didn’t go”  presently said “you came back” “i couldn’t get out   studio” clifford rejoined “the door  locked  felix  nailed some planks across  lower half   confounded windows  make  light come   above so they  no use i waited there  good while  then suddenly i felt ashamed i didn’t want   hiding away  my own father i couldn’t stand  any longer i bolted out  when i found   you i   little flurried but eugenia carried  off didn’t she” clifford added   tone   young humorist whose perception had not been permanently clouded   sense  his own discomfort “beautifully” said acton “especially”  continued “when one remembers  you  very imprudent   she must have been  good deal annoyed” “oh” cried clifford   indifference   young man who feels  however  may have failed  felicity  behavior   extremely just  his impressions “eugenia doesn’t care  anything” acton hesitated  moment “thank you  telling me this”  said  last and then laying his hand  clifford’s shoulder  added “tell me one thing more  you  chance  little  love   baroness” “no sir” said clifford almost shaking off his hand chapter x the first sunday  followed robert acton’s return  newport witnessed

thought she heard his step   piazza but   only  windowshutter shaking   raingust the baroness since  beginning   episode  her career  which  slight sketch  been attempted  these pages had had many moments  irritation but today her irritation had  peculiar keenness  appeared  feed upon itself it urged her  do something but  suggested no particularly profitable line  action if she could have done

“ah you have  fire”  said “les beaux jours sont passés” replied  baroness “never never they have only begun” felix declared planting himself before  hearth he turned his back   fire placed his hands behind him extended his legs  looked away through  window   expression  face which seemed  denote  perception  rosecolor even   tints   wet sunday his sister  her chair looked up  him watching him  what she saw  his face  not grateful  her present mood she  puzzled  many things but her brother’s disposition   frequent source  wonder  her i say frequent  not constant  there  long periods during which she gave her attention  other problems sometimes she had said  herself  his happy temper his eternal gaiety   affectation  pose but she  vaguely conscious  during  present summer  had been  highly successful comedian they had never yet had  explanation she had not known  need  one felix  presumably following  bent  his disinterested genius  she felt  she had no advice  give him   would understand with this there  always  certain element  comfort about felixthe assurance   would not interfere he  very delicate this pureminded felix  effect   her brother  madame münster felt  there   great propriety every way  that it  true  felix  delicate   not fond  explanations  his sister this  one   very few things   world about which   uncomfortable but now   not thinking  anything uncomfortable “dear brother” said eugenia  last “do stop making les yeux doux   rain” “with pleasure i  make them  you” answered felix “how much longer” asked eugenia   moment “do you propose  remain  this lovely spot” felix stared “do you want  go awayalready” “‘already’  delicious i am not so happy  you” felix dropped into  chair looking   fire “the fact  i am happy”  said  his light clear tone “and do you propose  spend your life  making love  gertrude wentworth” “yes” said felix smiling sidewise  his sister the baroness returned his glance much more gravely  then “do you like her” she asked “don’t you” felix demanded the baroness  silent  moment “i  answer you   words   gentleman who  asked if  liked music ‘je ne la crains pas’” “she admires you immensely” said felix “i don’t care  that other women should not admire one” “they should dislike you” again madame münster hesitated “they should hate me it’s  measure   time i have been losing here  they don’t” “no time  lost  which one  been happy” said felix   bright sententiousness which may well have been  little irritating “and  which” rejoined his sister   harsher laugh “one  secured  affections   young lady   fortune” felix explained very candidly  seriously “i have secured gertrude’s affection but i am  no means sure  i have secured her fortune that may comeor  may not” “ah well  may that’s  great point” “it depends upon her father he doesn’t smile upon our union you know  wants her  marry mr brand” “i know nothing about it” cried  baroness “please  put   log” felix complied  her request  sat watching  quickening   flame presently his sister added “and you propose  elope  mademoiselle” “by no means i don’t wish  do anything that’s disagreeable  mr wentworth he  been far too kind  us” “but you must choose between pleasing yourself  pleasing him” “i want  please everyone” exclaimed felix joyously “i have  good conscience i made up my mind   outset    not my place  make love  gertrude” “so  simplify matters she made love  you” felix looked  his sister  sudden gravity “you say you  not afraid  her”  said “but perhaps you ought  bea little she’s  very clever person” “i begin  see it” cried  baroness her brother making no rejoinder leaned back  his chair  there   long silence at last   altered accent madame münster put another question “you expect  any rate  marry” “i shall  greatly disappointed if we don’t” “a disappointment or two  do you good”  baroness declared “and afterwards do you mean  turn american” “it seems  me i am  very good american already but we shall go  europe gertrude wants extremely  see  world” “ah like me when i came here” said  baroness   little laugh “no not like you” felix rejoined looking  his sister   certain gentle seriousness while  looked  her she rose  her chair   also got up “gertrude  not  all like you”  went on “but  her own way she  almost  clever” he paused  moment his soul  full   agreeable feeling    lively disposition  express it his sister  his spiritual vision  always like  lunar disk when only  part    lighted the shadow  this bright surface seemed  him  expand   contract but whatever  proportions  always appreciated  moonlight he looked   baroness  then  kissed her “i am very much  love  gertrude”  said eugenia turned away  walked about  room  felix continued “she  very interesting  very different  what she seems she  never had  chance she  very brilliant we  go  europe  amuse ourselves” the baroness had gone   window where she stood looking out the day  drearier than ever  rain  doggedly falling “yes  amuse yourselves” she said  last “you had decidedly better go  europe” then she turned round looking  her brother a chair stood near her she leaned her hands upon  back  it “don’t you think   very good  me” she asked “to come all this way  you simply  see you properly marriedif properly  is” “oh    properly” cried felix  light eagerness the baroness gave  little laugh “you  thinking only  yourself  you don’t answer my question while you  amusing yourselfwith  brilliant gertrudewhat shall i  doing” “vous serez de la partie” cried felix “thank you i should spoil it” the baroness dropped her eyes  some moments “do you propose however  leave me here” she inquired felix smiled  her “my dearest sister where you  concerned i never propose i execute your commands” “i believe” said eugenia slowly “that you   most heartless person living don’t you see  i am  trouble” “i saw  you  not cheerful  i gave you some good news” “well let me give you some news” said  baroness “you probably  not have discovered   yourself robert acton wants  marry me” “no i had not discovered that but i quite understand it why does  make you unhappy” “because i can’t decide” “accept him accept him” cried felix joyously “he   best fellow   world” “he  immensely  love  me” said  baroness “and    large fortune permit me  turn  remind you  that” “oh i am perfectly aware  it” said eugenia “that’s  great item  his favor i am terribly candid” and she left her place  came nearer her brother looking  him hard he  turning over several things she  wondering  what manner  really understood her there  several ways  understanding her there  what she said  there  what she meant  there  something between  two   neither it  probable that   last analysis what she meant   felix should spare her  necessity  stating  case more exactly  should hold himself commissioned  assist her  all honorable means  marry  best fellow   world but  all this   never discovered what felix understood “once you have your liberty what  your objections”  asked “well i don’t particularly like him” “oh try  little” “i am trying now” said eugenia “i should succeed better if  didn’t live here i could never live here” “make him go  europe” felix suggested “ah there you speak  happiness based upon violent effort”  baroness rejoined “that  not what i am looking for he would never live  europe” “he would live anywhere  you” said felix gallantly his sister looked  him still   ray  penetration  her charming eyes then she turned away again “you see  all events” she presently went on “that if  had been said  me  i had come over here  seek my fortune  would have   added  i have found it” “don’t leave  lying” urged felix  smiling solemnity “i am much obliged  you  your interest” his sister declared after  moment “but promise me one thing pas de zèle if mr acton should ask you  plead his cause excuse yourself” “i shall certainly have  excuse” said felix “that i have  cause  my own  plead” “if  should talk  mefavorably” eugenia continued “warn him against dangerous illusions i detest importunities i want  decide  my leisure  my eyes open” “i shall  discreet” said felix “except  you to you i  say accept him outright” she had advanced   open doorway  she stood looking  him “i  go  dress  think  it” she said   heard her moving slowly  her apartments late   afternoon  rain stopped  just afterwards there   great flaming flickering trickling sunset felix sat  his paintingroom  did some work but  last   light which had not been brilliant began  fade  laid down his brushes  came out   little piazza   cottage here  walked up  down  some time looking   splendid blaze   western sky  saying   had often said before  this  certainly  country  sunsets there  something  these glorious deeps  fire  quickened his imagination  always found images  promises   western sky he thought   good many thingsof roaming about  world  gertrude wentworth  seemed  see their possible adventures   glowing frieze between  cloudbars then  what eugenia had just been telling him he wished very much  madame münster would make  comfortable  honorable marriage presently   sunset expanded  deepened  fancy took him  making  note  so magnificent  piece  coloring he returned  his studio  fetched out  small panel  his palette  brushes and placing  panel against  windowsill  began  daub  great gusto while   so occupied  saw mr brand   distance slowly come down  mr wentworth’s house nursing  large folded umbrella he walked   joyless meditative tread  his eyes  bent upon  ground felix poised his brush   moment watching him then   sudden impulse   drew nearer advanced   gardengate  signaled  himthe palette  bunch  brushes contributing  this effect mr brand stopped  started then  appeared  decide  accept felix’s invitation he came out  mr wentworth’s gate  passed along  road after which  entered  little garden   cottage felix had gone back  his sunset but  made his visitor welcome while  rapidly brushed  in “i wanted so much  speak  you  i thought i would call you”  said   friendliest tone “all  more  you have been  see me so little you have come  see my sister i know that but you haven’t come  see methe celebrated artist artists  very sensitive you know they notice those things” and felix turned round smiling   brush  his mouth mr brand stood there   certain blank candid majesty pulling together  large flaps  his umbrella “why should i come  see you”  asked “i know nothing  art” “it would sound very conceited i suppose” said felix “if i   say   would   good little chance  you  learn something you would ask me why you should learn  i should have no answer  that i suppose  minister  no need  art eh” “he  need  good temper sir” said mr brand  decision felix jumped up  his palette  his thumb   movement   liveliest deprecation “that’s because i keep you standing there while i splash my red paint i beg  thousand pardons you see what bad manners art gives  man  how right you   let  alone i didn’t mean you should stand either the piazza  you see  ornamented  rustic chairs though indeed i ought  warn you  they have nails   wrong places i  just making  note   sunset i never saw such  blaze  different reds it looks  if  celestial city   flames eh if   really  case i suppose  would   business  you theologians  put out  fire fancy mean ungodly artistquietly sitting down  paint it” mr brand had always credited felix young   certain impudence but  appeared  him   this occasion his impudence  so great   make  special explanationor even  apologynecessary and  impression  must  added  sufficiently natural felix had  all times  brilliant assurance  manner which  simply  vehicle  his good spirits  his good will but  present  had  special design    would have admitted   design  audacious so   conscious  having summoned all  arts  conversation  his aid but   so far  desiring  offend his visitor    rapidly asking himself what personal compliment  could pay  young clergyman  would gratify him most if  could think  it   prepared  pay  down “have you been preaching one  your beautiful sermons today”  suddenly asked laying down his palette this  not what felix had been trying  think of but    tolerable stopgap mr brand frownedas much   man can frown who  very fair soft eyebrows and beneath them very gentle tranquil eyes “no i have not preached any sermon today did you bring me over here   purpose  making  inquiry” felix saw    irritated   regretted  immensely but  had no fear  not being   end agreeable  mr brand he looked  him smiling  laying his hand  his arm “no no not  thatnot  that i wanted  ask you something i wanted  tell you something i am sure   interest you very much onlyas   something rather privatewe had better come into my little studio i have  western window we can still see  sunset andiamo” and  gave  little pat  his companion’s arm he led  way in mr brand stiffly  softly followed the twilight had thickened   little studio but  wall opposite  western window  covered   deep pink flush there   great many sketches  halffinished canvasses suspended  this rosy glow   corners   room  vague  dusky felix begged mr brand  sit down then glancing round him “by jove how pretty  looks”  cried but mr brand would not sit down  went  leaned against  window  wondered what felix wanted  him in  shadow   darker parts   wall  saw  gleam  three or four pictures  looked fantastic  surprising they seemed  represent naked figures felix stood there  his head  little bent  his eyes fixed upon his visitor smiling intensely pulling his moustache mr brand felt vaguely uneasy “it  very delicatewhat i want  say” felix began “but i have been thinking    some time” “please  say   quickly  possible” said mr brand “it’s because you   clergyman you know” felix went on “i don’t think i should venture  say    common man” mr brand  silent  moment “if    question  yielding   weakness  resenting  injury i am afraid i am  very common man” “my dearest friend” cried felix “this  not  injury it’s  benefita great service you  like  extremely only it’s so delicate” and   dim light  continued  smile intensely “you know i take  great interest  my cousinsin charlotte  gertrude wentworth that’s very evident  my having traveled some five thousand miles  see them” mr brand said nothing  felix proceeded “coming into their society   perfect stranger i received  course  great many new impressions  my impressions had  great freshness  great keenness do you know what i mean” “i am not sure  i do but i should like you  continue” “i think my impressions have always  good deal  freshness” said mr brand’s entertainer “but  this occasion   perhaps particularly natural thatcoming in  i say  outsidei should  struck  things  passed unnoticed among yourselves and then i had my sister  help me  she  simply  most observant woman   world” “i am not surprised” said mr brand “that  our little circle two intelligent persons should have found food  observation i am sure that  late i have found  myself” “ah but i shall surprise you yet” cried felix laughing “both my sister  i took  great fancy  my cousin charlotte” “your cousin charlotte” repeated mr brand “we fell  love  her   first” “you fell  love  charlotte” mr brand murmured “dame” exclaimed felix “she’s  very charming person  eugenia  especially smitten” mr brand stood staring   pursued “affection you know opens one’s eyes  we noticed something charlotte  not happy charlotte   love” and felix drawing nearer laid his hand again upon his companion’s arm there  something akin   acknowledgment  fascination   way mr brand looked  him but  young clergyman retained  yet quite enough selfpossession   able  say   good deal  solemnity “she  not  love  you” felix gave  light laugh  rejoined   alacrity   maritime adventurer who feels  puff  wind  his sail “ah no if she   love  me i should know it i am not so blind  you” “as i” “my dear sir you  stone blind poor charlotte  dead  love  you” mr brand said nothing   moment  breathed  little heavily “is  what you wanted  say  me”  asked “i have wanted  say  these three weeks because  late she  been worse i told you” added felix “it  very delicate” “well sir”mr brand began “well sir” “i  sure you didn’t know it” felix continued “but don’t you seeas soon  i mention ithow everything  explained” mr brand answered nothing  looked   chair  softly sat down felix could see    blushing  had looked straight  his host hitherto but now  looked away the foremost effect  what  had heard had been  sort  irritation  his modesty “of course” said felix “i suggest nothing  would  very presumptuous  me  advise you but i think there  no doubt about  fact” mr brand looked hard   floor  some moments   oppressed   mixture  sensations felix standing there  very sure  one  them  profound surprise the innocent young man had been completely unsuspicious  poor charlotte’s hidden flame this gave felix great hope   sure  mr brand would  flattered felix thought him very transparent  indeed   so  could neither simulate nor dissimulate “i scarcely know what  make  this”  said  last without looking up  felix  struck   fact   offered no protest or contradiction evidently felix had kindled  train  memoriesa retrospective illumination it  making  mr brand’s astonished eyes  very pretty blaze his second emotion had been  gratification  vanity “thank me  telling you” felix rejoined “it’s  good thing  know” “i am not sure  that” said mr brand “ah don’t let her languish” felix murmured lightly  softly “you do advise me then” and mr brand looked up “i congratulate you” said felix smiling he had thought  first his visitor  simply appealing but  saw    little ironical “it   your interest you have interfered  me”  young clergyman went on felix still stood  smiled the little room had grown darker   crimson glow had faded but mr brand could see  brilliant expression  his face “i won’t pretend not  know what you mean” said felix  last “but i have not really interfered  you of what you had  losewith another personyou have lost nothing and think what you have gained” “it seems  me i am  proper judge  each side” mr brand declared he got up holding  brim  his hat against his mouth  staring  felix through  dusk “you have lost  illusion” said felix “what do you call  illusion” “the belief  you really knowthat you have ever really knowngertrude wentworth depend upon that” pursued felix “i don’t know her yet but i have no illusions i don’t pretend to” mr brand kept gazing over his hat “she  always been  lucid limpid nature”  said solemnly “she  always been  dormant nature she  waiting   touchstone but now she  beginning  awaken” “don’t praise her  me” said mr brand   little quaver  his voice “if you have  advantage  me   not generous” “my dear sir i am melting  generosity” exclaimed felix “and i am not praising my cousin i am simply attempting  scientific definition  her she doesn’t care  abstractions now i think  contrary  what you have always fanciedis  basis  which you have been building she  extremely preoccupied   concrete i care   concrete too but gertrude  stronger than i she whirls me along” mr brand looked   moment into  crown  his hat “it’s  most interesting nature” “so  is” said felix “but  pullsit pullslike  runaway horse now i like  feeling   runaway horse  if i am thrown out   vehicle   no great matter but if you should  thrown mr brand”and felix paused  moment“another person also would suffer   accident” “what other person” “charlotte wentworth” mr brand looked  felix   moment sidewise mistrustfully then his eyes slowly wandered over  ceiling felix  sure   secretly struck   romance   situation “i think this  none  our business”  young minister murmured “none  mine perhaps but surely yours” mr brand lingered still looking   ceiling there  evidently something  wanted  say “what do you mean  miss gertrude being strong”  asked abruptly “well” said felix meditatively “i mean  she  had  great deal  selfpossession she  waitingfor years even when she seemed perhaps   living   present she knew how  wait she had  purpose that’s what i mean  her being strong” “but what do you mean  her purpose” “wellthe purpose  see  world” mr brand eyed his strange informant askance again but  said nothing at last  turned away  if  take leave he seemed bewildered however  instead  going   door  moved toward  opposite corner   room felix stood  watched him   momentalmost groping about   dusk then  led him   door   tender almost fraternal movement “is  all you have  say” asked mr brand “yes it’s allbut   bear  good deal  thinking of” felix went  him   gardengate  watched him slowly walk away into  thickening twilight   relaxed rigidity  tried  rectify itself “he  offended excited bewildered perplexedand enchanted” felix said  himself “that’s  capital mixture” chapter xi since  visit paid   baroness münster  mrs acton  which some account  given   earlier stage  this narrative  intercourse between these two ladies had been neither frequent nor intimate it  not  mrs acton had failed  appreciate madame münster’s charms   contrary her perception   graces  manner  conversation  her brilliant visitor had been only too acute mrs acton was  they said  boston very “intense”  her impressions  apt   too many  her the state  her health required  restriction  emotion  this  why receiving  she sat  her eternal armchair very few visitors even   soberest local type she had been obliged  limit  number  her interviews   lady whose costume  manner recalled  her imaginationmrs acton’s imagination   marvelall  she had ever read   most stirring historical periods but she had sent  baroness  great many quaintlyworded messages   great many nosegays  her garden  baskets  beautiful fruit felix had eaten  fruit   baroness had arranged  flowers  returned  baskets   messages on  day  followed  rainy sunday  which mention  been made eugenia determined  go  pay  beneficent invalid  “visite d’adieux” so   that  herself she qualified her enterprise it may  noted  neither   sunday evening nor   monday morning had she received  expected visit  robert acton to his own consciousness evidently   “keeping away”    baroness  her side  keeping away  her uncle’s whither  several days felix had been  unembarrassed bearer  apologies  regrets  absence chance had not taken  cards   hands  design mr wentworth  his daughters had respected eugenia’s seclusion certain intervals  mysterious retirement appeared  them vaguely  natural part   graceful rhythmic movement  so remarkable  life gertrude especially held these periods  honor she wondered what madame münster did  such times but she would not have permitted herself  inquire too curiously the long rain had freshened  air  twelve hours’ brilliant sunshine had dried  roads so   baroness   late afternoon proposing  walk  mrs acton’s exposed herself  no great discomfort as  her charming undulating step she moved along  clean grassy margin   road beneath  thicklyhanging boughs   orchards through  quiet   hour  place   rich maturity   summer she  even conscious   sort  luxurious melancholy the baroness had  amiable weakness  attaching herself  placeseven when she had begun   little aversion  now   prospect  departure she felt tenderly toward this wellwooded corner   western world where  sunsets  so beautiful  one’s ambitions  so pure mrs acton  able  receive her but  entering this lady’s large freshlyscented room  baroness saw  she  looking very ill she  wonderfully white  transparent and  her flowered armchair she made no attempt  move but she flushed  littlelike  young girl  baroness thoughtand she rested her clear smiling eyes upon those  her visitor her voice  low  monotonous like  voice  had never expressed any human passions “i have come  bid you goodbye” said eugenia “i shall soon  going away” “when  you going away” “very soonany day” “i am very sorry” said mrs acton “i hoped you would stayalways” “always” eugenia demanded “well i mean  long time” said mrs acton  her sweet feeble tone “they tell me you  so comfortablethat you have got such  beautiful little house” eugenia staredthat is she smiled she thought  her poor little chalet  she wondered whether her hostess  jesting “yes my house  exquisite” she said “though not   compared  yours” “and my son  so fond  going  see you” mrs acton added “i am afraid my son  miss you” “ah dear madam” said eugenia   little laugh “i can’t stay  america  your son” “don’t you like america” the baroness looked   front  her dress “if i liked itthat would not  staying  your son” mrs acton gazed  her  her grave tender eyes  if she had not quite understood the baroness  last found something irritating   sweet soft stare  her hostess  if one  not bound   merciful  great invalids she would almost have taken  liberty  pronouncing her mentally  fool “i am afraid then i shall never see you again” said mrs acton “you know i am dying” “ah dear madam” murmured eugenia “i want  leave my children cheerful  happy my daughter  probably marry her cousin” “two such interesting young people” said  baroness vaguely she  not thinking  clifford wentworth “i feel so tranquil about my end” mrs acton went on “it  coming so easily so surely” and she paused  her mild gaze always  eugenia’s the baroness hated   reminded  death but even   imminence so far  mrs acton  concerned she preserved her good manners “ah madam you  too charming  invalid” she rejoined but  delicacy  this rejoinder  apparently lost upon her hostess who went   her low reasonable voice “i want  leave my children bright  comfortable you seem  me all so happy herejust  you are so i wish you could stay it would  so pleasant  robert” eugenia wondered what she meant   being pleasant  robert but she felt  she would never know what such  woman   meant she got up she  afraid mrs acton would tell her again  she  dying “goodbye dear madam” she said “i must remember  your strength  precious” mrs acton took her hand  held   moment “well you have been happy here haven’t you and you like us all don’t you i wish you would stay” she added “in your beautiful little house” she had told eugenia  her waitingwoman would    hall  show her downstairs but  large landing outside her door  empty  eugenia stood there looking about she felt irritated  dying lady had not “la main heureuse” she passed slowly downstairs still looking about the broad staircase made  great bend    angle   high window looking westward   deep bench covered   row  flowering plants  curious old pots  blue chinaware the yellow afternoon light came  through  flowers  flickered  little   white wainscots eugenia paused  moment  house  perfectly still save   ticking somewhere   great clock the lower hall stretched away   foot   stairs half covered over   large oriental rug eugenia lingered  little noticing  great many things “comme c’est bien” she said  herself such  large solid irreproachable basis  existence  place seemed  her  indicate and then she reflected  mrs acton  soon  withdraw  it the reflection accompanied her  rest   way downstairs where she paused again making more observations the hall  extremely broad   either side   front door   wide deeplyset window which threw  shadows  everything back into  house there  highbacked chairs along  wall  big eastern vases upon tables and  either side  large cabinet   glass front  little curiosities within dimly gleaming the doors  openinto  darkened parlor  library  diningroom all these rooms seemed empty eugenia passed along  stopped  moment   threshold  each “comme c’est bien” she murmured again she had thought  just such  house  this when she decided  come  america she opened  front door  herselfher light tread had summoned none   servantsand   threshold she gave  last look outside she  still   humor  curious contemplation so instead  going directly down  little drive   gate she wandered away towards  garden which lay   right   house she had not gone many yards over  grass before she paused quickly she perceived  gentleman stretched upon  level verdure beneath  tree he had not heard her coming   lay motionless flat  his back  his hands clasped under his head staring up   sky so   baroness  able  reflect  her leisure upon  question  his identity it     person who had lately been much  her thoughts but her first impulse nevertheless   turn away  last thing she desired   have  air  coming  quest  robert acton the gentleman   grass however gave her no time  decide  could not long remain unconscious  so agreeable  presence he rolled back his eyes stared gave  exclamation  then jumped up he stood  instant looking  her “excuse my ridiculous position”  said “i have just now no sense   ridiculous but  case you have don’t imagine i came  see you” “take care” rejoined acton “how you put  into my head i  thinking  you” “the occupation  extreme leisure” said  baroness “to think   woman when you    position  no compliment” “i didn’t say i  thinking well” acton affirmed smiling she looked  him  then she turned away “though i didn’t come  see you” she said “remember  least  i am within your gates” “i am delightedi am honored won’t you come into  house” “i have just come out  it i have been calling upon your mother i have been bidding her farewell” “farewell” acton demanded “i am going away” said  baroness and she turned away again  if  illustrate her meaning “when  you going” asked acton standing  moment  his place but  baroness made no answer   followed her “i came this way  look  your garden” she said walking back   gate over  grass “but i must go” “let me  least go  you” he went  her  they said nothing till they reached  gate it  open  they looked down  road which  darkened over  long bosky shadows “must you go straight home” acton asked but she made no answer she said after  moment “why have you not been  see me” he said nothing  then she went on “why don’t you answer me” “i am trying  invent  answer” acton confessed “have you none ready” “none  i can tell you”  said “but let me walk  you now” “you may do  you like” she moved slowly along  road  acton went  her presently  said “if i had done  i liked i would have come  see you several times” “is  invented” asked eugenia “no   natural i stayed away because” “ah here comes  reason then” “because i wanted  think about you” “because you wanted  lie down” said  baroness “i have seen you lie downalmostin my drawingroom” acton stopped   road   movement which seemed  beg her  linger  little she paused   looked  her awhile  thought her very charming “you  jesting”  said “but if you  really going away   very serious” “if i stay”  she gave  little laugh “it  more serious still” “when shall you go” “as soon  possible” “and why” “why should i stay” “because we all admire you so” “that  not  reason i am admired also  europe” and she began  walk homeward again “what could i say  keep you” asked acton he wanted  keep her     fact   had been thinking  her   week he   love  her now   conscious  that or  thought  was   only question  him  whether  could trust her “what you can say  keep me” she repeated “as i want very much  go   not  my interest  tell you besides i can’t imagine” he went   her  silence   much more affected  what she had told him than appeared ever since  evening  his return  newport her image had had  terrible power  trouble him what clifford wentworth had told himthat had affected him too   adverse sense but  had not liberated him   discomfort   charm  which his intelligence  impatient “she  not honest she  not honest”  kept murmuring  himself that  what  had been saying   summer sky ten minutes before unfortunately   unable  say  finally definitively  now    near her  seemed  matter wonderfully little “she   woman who  lie”  had said  himself now   went along  reminded himself  this observation but  failed  frighten him   had done before he almost wished

driven  her but  had never walked  her “by jove how comme il faut she is”  said   observed her sidewise when they reached  cottage   orchard she passed into  gate without asking him  follow but she turned round   stood there  bid him goodnight “i asked you  question  other night which you never answered”  said “have you sent off  documentliberating yourself” she hesitated   single momentvery naturally then “yes” she said simply he turned away  wondered whether  would do  his lie but  saw her again  evening   baroness reappeared  her uncle’s he had little talk  her however two gentlemen

“makes him do what she wishes” she had been sitting just within one   long windows  opened upon  piazza but very soon after acton had gone away she got up abruptly just when  talkative gentleman  boston  asking her what she thought   “moral tone”   city on  piazza she encountered clifford wentworth coming round   other side   house she stopped him she told him she wished  speak  him “why didn’t you go home  your cousin” she asked clifford stared “why robert  taken her”  said “exactly so but you don’t usually leave   him” “oh” said clifford “i want  see those fellows start off they don’t know how  drive” “it  not then  you have quarreled  your cousin” clifford reflected  moment  then   simplicity which had   baroness  singularly baffling quality “oh no we have made up”  said she looked  him  some moments but clifford had begun   afraid   baroness’s looks   endeavored now  shift himself out  their range “why do you never come  see me any more” she asked “have i displeased you” “displeased me well i guess not” said clifford   laugh “why haven’t you come then” “well because i am afraid  getting shut up   back room” eugenia kept looking  him “i should think you would like that” “like it” cried clifford “i should if i   young man calling upon  charming woman” “a charming woman isn’t much use  me when i am shut up   back room” “i am afraid i am not  much use  you anywhere” said madame münster “and yet you know how i have offered  be” “well” observed clifford  way  response “there comes  buggy” “never mind  buggy do you know i am going away” “do you mean now” “i mean   few days i leave this place” “you  going back  europe” “to europe where you   come  see me” “oh yes i’ll come out there” said clifford “but before that” eugenia declared “you must come  see me here” “well i shall keep clear   back room” rejoined her simple young kinsman the baroness  silent  moment “yes you must come franklyboldly that   very much better i see  now” “i see it” said clifford and then   instant “what’s  matter   buggy” his practiced ear had apparently detected  unnatural creak   wheels   light vehicle which had been brought   portico   hurried away  investigate so

 her needle poised    certain shy fluttered look which she always wore when  approached her there  something  felix’s manner  quickened her modesty her selfconsciousness if absolute choice had been given her she would have preferred never  find herself alone  him   fact though she thought him  most brilliant distinguished  wellmeaning person she had exercised  much larger amount  tremulous tact than  had ever suspected  circumvent  accident  têteàtête poor charlotte could have given no account   matter  would not have seemed unjust both  herself   her foreign kinsman she could only have saidor rather she would never have said itthat she did not like so much gentleman’s society  once she  not reassured accordingly when  began emphasizing his words   kind  admiring radiance “my dear cousin i am enchanted  finding you alone” “i am very often alone” charlotte observed then she quickly added “i don’t mean i am lonely” “so clever  woman  you  never lonely” said felix “you have company  your beautiful work” and  glanced   big slipper “i like  work” declared charlotte simply “so do i” said her companion “and i like  idle too but   not  idle  i have come  search  you i want

pursued charlotte had laid her work  her lap her hands  tightly folded  top  it she  staring   carpet “in short i’m  love dear lady” said felix “now i want you  help me” “to help you” asked charlotte   tremor “i don’t mean  gertrude she  i have  perfect understanding  oh how well she understands one i mean  your father    world  general including mr brand” “poor mr brand” said charlotte slowly but   simplicity which made  evident  felix   young minister had not repeated  miss wentworth  talk  had lately occurred between them “ah now don’t say ‘poor’ mr brand i don’t pity mr brand  all but i pity your father  little  i don’t want  displease him therefore you see i want you  plead  me you don’t think me very shabby eh” “shabby” exclaimed charlotte softly  whom felix represented  most polished  iridescent qualities  mankind “i don’t mean  my appearance” rejoined felix laughing  charlotte  looking  his boots “i mean  my conduct you don’t think it’s  abuse  hospitality” “toto care  gertrude” asked charlotte “to have really expressed one’s self because i have expressed myself charlotte i must tell you  whole truthi have of course i want  marry herand here   difficulty i held off  long  i could but she  such  terribly fascinating person she’s  strange creature charlotte i don’t believe you really know her” charlotte took up her tapestry again  again she laid  down “i know your father  had higher views” felix continued “and i think you have shared them you have wanted  marry her  mr brand” “oh no” said charlotte very earnestly “mr brand  always admired her but we did not want anything   kind” felix stared “surely marriage  what you proposed” “yes but we didn’t wish  force her” “a la bonne heure that’s very unsafe you know with these arranged marriages there  often  deuce

fellow comes alongand voilà” charlotte sat mutely staring   floor  felix presently added “do go   your slipper i like  see you work” charlotte took up her variegated canvas  began  draw vague blue stitches   big round rose “if gertrude  soso strange” she said “why do you want  marry her” “ah that’s it dear charlotte i like strange women i always have liked them ask eugenia and gertrude  wonderful she says  most beautiful things” charlotte looked  him almost   first time  if her meaning required   severely pointed “you have  great influence over her” “yesand no” said felix “i had  first i think but now   six  one  halfadozen   other   reciprocal she affects me stronglyfor she is so strong i don’t believe you know her it’s  beautiful nature” “oh yes felix i have always thought gertrude’s nature beautiful” “well if you think so now” cried  young man “wait  see she’s  folded flower let me pluck her   parent tree  you  see her expand i’m sure you  enjoy it” “i don’t understand

you areyou especially because” added felix hastily “you   woman but i don’t pity him it ought   enough  any man  you take  interest  him” “it  not enough  mr brand” said charlotte simply and she stood there  moment  if waiting conscientiously  anything more  felix might have  say “mr brand  not so keen about his marriage   was”  presently said “he  afraid  your sister he begins  think she  wicked” charlotte looked  him now  beautiful appealing eyeseyes into which  saw  tears rising “oh felix felix” she cried “what have you done  her” “i think she  asleep i have waked her up” but charlotte apparently  really crying she walked straight out   room and felix standing there  meditating had  apparent brutality  take satisfaction  her tears late  night gertrude silent  serious came  him

gertrude looked  him  some time “i don’t understand you” “you very often say that”  said “considering how little we understand each other    wonder how well we get on” “we have done nothing but meet since you came herebut meet alone the first time i ever saw you we  alone” gertrude went on “what   difference now is  because    night” “the difference gertrude” said felix stopping   path “the difference   i love you moremore than before” and then they stood there talking   warm stillness   front   closed dark house “i have been talking  charlottebeen trying  bespeak her interest  your father she   kind  sublime perversity  ever  woman so bent upon cutting off her own head” “you  too careful” said gertrude “you  too diplomatic” “well” cried  young man “i didn’t come here  make anyone unhappy” gertrude looked round her awhile   odorous darkness “i  do anything you please” she said “for instance” asked felix smiling “i  go away i  do anything you please” felix looked  her  solemn admiration “yes we  go away”  said “but we  make peace first” gertrude looked about her again  then she broke out passionately “why do they try  make one feel guilty why do they make  so difficult why can’t they understand” “i  make them understand” said felix he drew her hand into his arm  they wandered about   garden talking   hour chapter xii felix allowed charlotte time  plead his cause  then   third day  sought  interview  his uncle it    morning mr wentworth   his office and  going in felix found  charlotte    moment  conference  her father she had  fact been constantly near

suitor had shown no sign  faltering charlotte trembled all over when she allowed herself  believe   instant now  then that privately mr brand might have faltered    seemed  give more force  felix’s words  repeat them  her father she  waiting until she should have taught herself   very calm but she had now begun  tell mr wentworth  she  extremely anxious she  proceeding  develop this idea

his nephew  stroked down  first page   advertiser “i ought  have brought  bouquet” said felix laughing “in france they always do” “we  not  france” observed mr wentworth gravely while charlotte earnestly gazed  him “no luckily we  not  france where i am afraid i should have  harder time  it my dear charlotte have you rendered me  delightful service” and felix bent toward her  if someone had been presenting him charlotte looked  him  almost frightened eyes  mr wentworth thought this might   beginning   discussion “what   bouquet for”  inquired  way  turning  off felix gazed  him smiling “pour la demande” and then drawing up  chair  seated himself hat  hand   kind  conscious solemnity presently  turned  charlotte again “my good charlotte my admirable charlotte”  murmured “you have not played me falseyou have not sided against me” charlotte got up trembling extremely though imperceptibly “you must speak  my father yourself” she said “i think you  clever enough” but felix rising too begged her  remain “i can speak better   audience”  declared “i hope   nothing disagreeable” said mr wentworth “it’s something delightful  me” and felix laying down his hat clasped his hands  little between his knees “my dear uncle”  said “i desire very earnestly  marry your daughter gertrude” charlotte sank slowly into her chair again  mr wentworth sat staring   light  his face  might have been flashed back   iceberg he stared  stared  said nothing felix fell back  his hands still clasped “ahyou don’t like it i  afraid” he blushed deeply  charlotte noticed itremarking  herself     first time she had ever seen him blush she began  blush herself   reflect   might  much  love “this  very abrupt” said mr wentworth  last “have you never suspected it dear uncle” felix inquired “well  proves how discreet i have been yes i thought you wouldn’t like it” “it  very serious felix” said mr wentworth “you think it’s  abuse  hospitality” exclaimed felix smiling again “of hospitalityan abuse” his uncle repeated very slowly “that  what felix said  me” said charlotte conscientiously “of course you think so don’t defend yourself” felix pursued “it is  abuse obviously  most i can claim     perhaps  pardonable one i simply fell head over heels  love one can hardly help that though you  gertrude’s progenitor i don’t believe you know how attractive she is dear uncle she contains  elements   singularlyi may say  strangelycharming woman” “she  always been  me  object  extreme concern” said mr wentworth “we have always desired her happiness” “well here  is” felix declared “i  make her happy she believes it too now hadn’t you noticed that” “i had noticed  she  much changed” mr wentworth declared   tone whose unexpressive unimpassioned quality appeared  felix  reveal  profundity  opposition “it may   she  only becoming what you call  charming woman” “gertrude  heart  so earnest so true” said charlotte very softly fastening her eyes upon her father “i delight  hear you praise her” cried felix “she   very peculiar temperament” said mr wentworth “eh even   praise” felix rejoined “i know i am not  man you might have looked for i have no position  no fortune i can give gertrude no place   world a place   worldthat’s what she ought  have  would bring her out” “a place  do her duty” remarked mr wentworth “ah how charmingly she does ither duty” felix exclaimed   radiant face “what  exquisite conception she   it but she comes honestly  that dear uncle” mr wentworth  charlotte both looked  him  if they  watching  greyhound doubling “of course  me she  hide her light under  bushel”  continued “i being  bushel now i know you like meyou have certainly proved it but you think i am frivolous  penniless  shabby grantedgranteda thousand times granted i have been  loose fisha fiddler  painter  actor but there  this   said in  first place i fancy you exaggerate you lend me qualities i haven’t had i have been  bohemianyes but  bohemia i always passed   gentleman i wish you could see some  my old camaradesthey would tell you it   liberty i liked but not  opportunities my sins  all peccadilloes i always respected my neighbor’s propertymy neighbor’s wife do you see dear uncle” mr wentworth ought  have seen his cold blue eyes  intently fixed “and then c’est fini it’s all over je me range i have settled down   jogtrot i find i can earn my livinga very fair oneby going about  world  painting bad portraits it’s not  glorious profession but    perfectly respectable one you won’t deny that eh going about  world i say i must not deny that   i am afraid i

even thinks    charming   brings me  my third point gertrude likes me encourage her  little  she  tell you so” felix’s tongue obviously moved much faster than  imagination  his auditors his eloquence like  rocking   boat   deep smooth lake made long eddies  silence and  seemed   pleading  chattering still  his brightly eager smile his uplifted eyebrows his expressive mouth after  had ceased speaking  while  his glance quickly turning   father   daughter  sat waiting   effect  his appeal “it  not your want  means” said mr wentworth after  period  severe reticence “now it’s delightful  you  say that only don’t say it’s my want  character because i have  characteri assure you i have  small one  little slip   thing but still something tangible” “ought you not  tell felix    mr brand father” charlotte asked  infinite mildness “it  not only mr brand” mr wentworth solemnly declared and  looked  his knee   long time “it  difficult  explain”  said he wished evidently   very just “it rests  moral grounds  mr brand says it   question whether    best thing  gertrude” “what  betterwhat  better dear uncle” felix rejoined urgently rising  his urgency  standing before mr wentworth his uncle had been looking  his knee but when felix moved  transferred his gaze   handle   door which faced him “it  usually  fairly good thing   girl  marry  man she loves” cried felix while  spoke mr wentworth saw  handle   door begin  turn  door opened  remained slightly ajar until felix had delivered himself   cheerful axiom just quoted then  opened altogether  gertrude stood there she looked excited there   spark  her sweet dull eyes she came  slowly but   air  resolution and closing  door softly looked round   three persons present felix went  her  tender gallantry holding out his hand  charlotte made  place  her   sofa but gertrude put her hands behind her  made no motion  sit down “we  talking  you” said felix “i know it” she answered “that’s why i came” and she fastened her eyes  her father who returned her gaze very fixedly in his own cold blue eyes there   kind  pleading reasoning light “it  better you should  present” said mr wentworth “we  discussing your future” “why discuss it” asked gertrude “leave   me” “that is  me” cried felix “i leave it   last resort   greater wisdom than ours” said  old man felix rubbed his forehead gently “but en attendant  last resort your father lacks confidence”  said  gertrude “haven’t you confidence  felix” gertrude  frowning there  something about her  her father  charlotte had never seen charlotte got up  came  her  if  put her arm round her but suddenly she seemed afraid  touch her mr wentworth however  not afraid “i have had more confidence  felix than  you”  said “yes you have never had confidence  menever never i don’t know why” “oh sister sister” murmured charlotte “you have always needed advice” mr wentworth declared “you have had  difficult temperament” “why do you call  difficult it might have been easy if you had allowed it you wouldn’t let me  natural i don’t know what you wanted  make  me mr brand   worst” charlotte  last took hold  her sister she laid her two hands upon gertrude’s arm “he cares so much  you” she almost whispered gertrude looked  her intently  instant then kissed her “no  does not” she said “i have never seen you so passionate” observed mr wentworth   air  indignation mitigated  high principles “i am sorry if i offend you” said gertrude “you offend me but i don’t think you  sorry” “yes father she  sorry” said charlotte “i would even go further dear uncle” felix interposed “i would question whether she really offends you how can she offend you” to this mr wentworth made no immediate answer then   moment “she  not profited  we hoped” “profited ah voilà” felix exclaimed gertrude  very pale she stood looking down “i have told felix i would go away  him” she presently said “ah you have said some admirable things” cried  young man “go away sister” asked charlotte “awayaway  some strange country” “that   frighten you” said felix smiling  charlotte “towhat do you call it” asked gertrude turning  instant  felix “to bohemia” “do you propose  dispense  preliminaries” asked mr wentworth getting up “dear uncle vous plaisantez” cried felix “it seems  me  these  preliminaries” gertrude turned  her father “i have profited” she said “you wanted  form my character well my character  formedfor my age i know what i want i have chosen i am determined  marry this gentleman” “you had better consent sir” said felix very gently “yes sir you had better consent” added  very different voice charlotte gave  little jump   others turned   direction  which  had come it   voice  mr brand who had stepped through  long window which stood open   piazza he stood patting his forehead  his pockethandkerchief   very much flushed his face wore  singular expression “yes sir you had better consent” mr brand repeated coming forward “i know what miss gertrude means” “my dear friend” murmured felix laying his hand caressingly   young minister’s arm mr brand looked  him then  mr wentworth lastly  gertrude he did not look  charlotte but charlotte’s earnest eyes  fastened  his own countenance they  asking  immense question  it the answer  this question could not come all  once but some   elements    there it  one   elements    mr brand  very red   held his head very high   had  bright excited eye   air  embarrassed boldnessthe air   man who  taken  resolve   execution  which  apprehends  failure not  his moral but  his personal resources charlotte thought  looked very grand    incontestable  mr brand felt very grand this  fact   grandest moment  his life    natural  such  moment should contain opportunities  awkwardness   large stout modest young man “come in sir” said mr wentworth   angular wave  his hand “it  very proper  you should  present” “i know what you  talking about” mr brand rejoined “i heard what your nephew said” “and  heard what you said” exclaimed felix patting him again   arm “i am not sure  i understood” said mr wentworth who had angularity  his voice  well   his gestures gertrude had been looking hard  her former suitor she had been puzzled like her sister but her imagination moved more quickly than charlotte’s “mr brand asked you  let felix take me away” she said  her father the young minister gave her  strange look “it  not because i don’t want  see you any more”  declared   tone intended     publicity “i shouldn’t think you would want  see me any more” gertrude answered gently mr wentworth stood staring “isn’t this rather  change sir”  inquired “yes sir” and mr brand looked anywhere only still not  charlotte “yes sir”  repeated and  held his handkerchief  few moments  his lips “where  our moral grounds” demanded mr wentworth who had always thought mr brand would  just  thing   younger daughter   peculiar temperament “it  sometimes very moral  change you know” suggested felix charlotte had softly left her sister’s side she had edged gently toward her father  now her hand found  way into his arm mr wentworth had folded up  advertiser into  surprisingly small compass and holding  roll  one hand  earnestly clasped    other mr brand  looking  him  yet though charlotte  so near his eyes failed  meet her own gertrude watched her sister “it  better not  speak  change” said mr brand “in one sense there  no change there  something i desiredsomething i asked  you i desire something stilli ask   you” and  paused  moment mr wentworth looked bewildered “i should like  my ministerial capacity  unite this young couple” gertrude watching her sister saw charlotte flushing intensely  mr wentworth felt her pressing upon his arm “heavenly powers” murmured mr wentworth and    nearest approach  profanity  had ever made “that  very nice   very handsome” felix exclaimed “i don’t understand” said mr wentworth though   plain  everyone else did “that  very beautiful mr brand” said gertrude emulating felix “i should like  marry you it  give me great pleasure” “as gertrude says it’s  beautiful idea” said felix felix  smiling but mr brand  not even trying to he himself treated his proposition very seriously “i have thought  it  i should like  do it”  affirmed charlotte meanwhile  staring  expanded eyes her imagination  i have said  not so rapid  her sister’s but now  had taken several little jumps “father” she murmured “consent” mr brand heard her  looked away mr wentworth evidently had no imagination  all “i have always thought”  began slowly “that gertrude’s character required  special line  development” “father” repeated charlotte “consent” then  last mr brand looked  her her father felt her leaning more heavily upon his folded arm than she had ever done before  this   certain sweet faintness  her voice made him wonder what   matter he looked down  her  saw  encounter  her gaze   young theologian’s but even this told him nothing   continued   bewildered nevertheless “i consent”  said  last “since mr brand recommends it” “i should like  perform  ceremony very soon” observed mr brand   sort  solemn simplicity “come come that’s charming” cried felix profanely mr wentworth sank into his chair “doubtless when you understand it”  said   certain judicial asperity gertrude went  her sister  led her away  felix having passed his arm into mr brand’s  stepped out   long window  him  old man  left sitting there  unillumined perplexity felix did no work  day in  afternoon  gertrude  got into one   boats  floated about  idlydipping oars they talked  good deal  mr brandthough not exclusively “that   fine stroke” said felix “it  really heroic” gertrude sat musing  her eyes upon  ripples “that  what  wanted  be  wanted  do something fine” “he won’t  comfortable till   married us” said felix “so much  better” “he wanted   magnanimous  wanted  have  fine moral pleasure i know him so well” gertrude went on felix looked  her she spoke slowly gazing   clear water “he thought    great deal night  day he thought  would  beautiful at last  made up his mind    his duty his duty  do just thatnothing less than that he felt exalted  felt sublime that’s how  likes  feel it  better  him than if i had listened  him” “it’s better  me” smiled felix “but do you know  regards  sacrifice  i don’t believe  admired you when this decision  taken quite so much   had done  fortnight before” “he never admired me he admires charlotte  pitied me i know him so well” “well then  didn’t pity you so much” gertrude looked  felix  little smiling “you shouldn’t permit yourself” she said “to diminish  splendor  his action he admires charlotte” she repeated “that’s capital” said felix laughingly  dipping his oars i cannot say exactly  which member  gertrude’s phrase  alluded but  dipped his oars again  they kept floating about neither felix nor his sister   day  present  mr wentworth’s   evening repast the two occupants   chalet dined together   young man informed his companion  his marriage  now  assured fact eugenia congratulated him  replied  if    reasonable  husband   had been   whole  brother his wife would have nothing  complain of felix looked  her  moment smiling “i hope”  said “not   thrown back  my reason” “it  very true” eugenia rejoined “that one’s reason  dismally flat it’s  bed   mattress removed” but  brother  sister later   evening crossed over   larger house  baroness desiring  compliment her prospective sisterinlaw they found  usual circle upon  piazza   exception  clifford wentworth  lizzie acton   everyone stood up  usual  welcome  baroness eugenia had  admiring audience  her compliment  gertrude robert acton stood   edge   piazza leaning against one   white columns so   found himself next  eugenia while she acquitted herself   neat little discourse  congratulation “i shall  so glad  know you better” she said “i have seen so much less  you than i should have liked naturally now i see  reason why you  love me  little won’t you i think i may say i gain  being known” and terminating these observations   softest cadence  her voice  baroness imprinted  sort  grand official kiss upon gertrude’s forehead increased familiarity had not  gertrude’s imagination diminished  mysterious impressiveness  eugenia’s personality  she felt flattered  transported  this little ceremony robert acton also seemed  admire it   admired so many   gracious manifestations  madame münster’s wit they had  privilege  making him restless   this occasion  walked away suddenly  his hands  his pockets  then came back  leaned against his column eugenia  now complimenting her uncle upon his daughter’s engagement  mr wentworth  listening  his usual plain yet refined politeness it    supposed   this time his perception   mutual relations   young people who surrounded him had become more acute but  still took  matter very seriously    not  all exhilarated “felix  make her  good husband” said eugenia “he    charming companion    great qualityindestructible gaiety” “you think that’s  great quality” asked  old man eugenia meditated  her eyes upon his “you think one gets tired  it eh” “i don’t know  i am prepared  say that” said mr wentworth “well we  say then    tiresome  others but delightful  one’s self a woman’s husband you know  supposed   her second self so that  felix  gertrude gaiety    common property” “gertrude  always very gay” said mr wentworth he  trying  follow this argument robert acton took his hands out  his pockets  came  little nearer   baroness “you say you gain  being known”  said “one certainly gains  knowing you” “what have you gained” asked eugenia “an immense amount  wisdom” “that’s  questionable advantage   man who  already so wise” acton shook his head “no i   great fool before i knew you” “and being  fool you made my acquaintance you  very complimentary” “let me keep  up” said acton laughing “i hope  our pleasure  your brother’s marriage  detain you” “why should i stop  my brother’s marriage when i would not stop  my own” asked  baroness “why shouldn’t you stop  either case now that  you say you have dissolved  mechanical tie  bound you  europe” the baroness looked  him  moment “as i say you look  if you doubted it” “ah” said acton returning her glance “that   remnant  my old folly we have other attractions”  added “we   have another marriage” but she seemed not  hear him she  looking  him still “my word  never doubted before” she said “we   have another marriage” acton repeated smiling then she appeared  understand “another marriage” and she looked   others felix  chattering  gertrude charlotte   distance  watching them  mr brand  quite another quarter  turning his back  them and  his hands under his coattails  his large head  one side  looking   small tender crescent   young moon “it ought   mr brand  charlotte” said eugenia “but  doesn’t look like it” “there” acton answered “you must judge just now  contraries there  more than there looks  be i expect  combination one  these days but   not what i meant” “well” said  baroness “i never guess my own lovers so i can’t guess other people’s” acton gave  loud laugh    about  add  rejoinder when mr wentworth approached his niece “you   interested  hear”  old man said   momentary aspiration toward jocosity “of another matrimonial venture  our little circle” “i  just telling  baroness” acton observed “mr acton  apparently about  announce his own engagement” said eugenia mr wentworth’s jocosity increased “it  not exactly that but     family clifford hearing this morning  mr brand had expressed  desire  tie  nuptial knot  his sister took  into his head  arrange that while his hand  in our good friend should perform  like ceremony  himself  lizzie acton” the baroness threw back her head  smiled  her uncle then turning   intenser radiance  robert acton “i am certainly very stupid not  have thought  that” she said acton looked down  his boots  if  thought  had perhaps reached  limits  legitimate experimentation    moment eugenia said nothing more it had been  fact  sharp knock  she needed  recover herself this  done however promptly enough “where   young people” she asked “they  spending  evening  my mother” “is not  thing very sudden” acton looked up “extremely sudden there had been  tacit understanding but within  day or two clifford appears  have received some mysterious impulse  precipitate  affair” “the impulse” said  baroness “was  charms  your very pretty sister” “but my sister’s charms   old story  had always known her” acton had begun  experiment again here however   evident  baroness would not help him “ah one can’t say clifford  very young but    nice boy” “he’s  likeable sort  boy      rich man” this  acton’s last experiment madame münster turned away she made but  short visit  felix took her home in her little drawingroom she went almost straight   mirror over  chimneypiece and   candle uplifted stood looking into it “i shall not wait  your marriage” she said  her brother “tomorrow my maid shall pack up” “my dear sister” felix exclaimed “we    married immediately mr brand  too uncomfortable” but eugenia turning  still holding her candle aloft only looked about  little sittingroom  her gimcracks  curtains  cushions “my maid shall pack up” she repeated “bonté divine what rubbish i feel like  strolling actress these  my ‘properties’” “is  play over eugenia” asked felix she gave him  sharp glance “i have spoken my part” “with great applause” said her brother “oh applauseapplause” she murmured and she gathered up two or three  her dispersed draperies she glanced   beautiful brocade  then “i don’t see how i can have endured it” she said “endure   little longer come  my wedding” “thank you that’s your affair my affairs  elsewhere” “where  you going” “to germanyby  first ship” “you have decided not  marry mr acton” “i have refused him” said eugenia her brother looked  her  silence “i am sorry”  rejoined  last “but i  very discreet  you asked me  be i said nothing” “please continue then not  allude   matter” said eugenia felix inclined himself gravely “you shall  obeyed but your position  germany”  pursued “please  make no observations upon it” “i  only going  say  i supposed   altered” “you  mistaken” “but i thought you had signed” “i have not signed” said  baroness felix urged her no further    arranged   should immediately assist her  embark mr brand  indeed  appeared very impatient  consummate his sacrifice  deliver  nuptial benediction which would set  off so handsomely but eugenia’s impatience  withdraw   country  which she had not found  fortune she had come  seek  even less   mistaken it  true she had not made any very various exertion but she appeared  feel justified
