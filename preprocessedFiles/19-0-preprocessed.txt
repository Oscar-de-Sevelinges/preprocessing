this song  hiawatha i the peacepipe on  mountains   prairie on  great red pipestone quarry gitche manito  mighty he  master  life descending on  red crags   quarry stood erect  called  nations called  tribes  men together from his footprints flowed  river leaped into  light  morning o’er  precipice plunging downward gleamed like ishkoodah  comet and  spirit stooping earthward with his finger   meadow traced  winding pathway  it saying  it “run  this way” from  red stone   quarry with his hand  broke  fragment moulded  into  pipehead shaped  fashioned   figures from  margin   river took  long reed   pipestem with  dark green leaves upon it filled  pipe  bark  willow with  bark   red willow breathed upon  neighboring forest made  great boughs chafe together till  flame they burst  kindled and erect upon  mountains gitche manito  mighty smoked  calumet  peacepipe as  signal   nations and  smoke rose slowly slowly through  tranquil air  morning first  single line  darkness then  denser bluer vapor then  snowwhite cloud unfolding like  treetops   forest ever rising rising rising till  touched  top  heaven till  broke against  heaven and rolled outward all around it from  vale  tawasentha from  valley  wyoming from  groves  tuscaloosa from  faroff rocky mountains from  northern lakes  rivers all  tribes beheld  signal saw  distant smoke ascending the pukwana   peacepipe and  prophets   nations said “behold it  pukwana by  signal   peacepipe bending like  wand  willow waving like  hand  beckons gitche manito  mighty calls  tribes  men together calls  warriors  his council” down  rivers o’er  prairies came  warriors   nations came  delawares  mohawks came  choctaws  camanches came  shoshonies  blackfeet came  pawnees  omahas came  mandans  dacotahs came  hurons  ojibways all  warriors drawn together by  signal   peacepipe to  mountains   prairie to  great red pipestone quarry and they stood there   meadow with their weapons  their wargear painted like  leaves  autumn painted like  sky  morning wildly glaring  each other in their faces stern defiance in their hearts  feuds  ages the hereditary hatred the ancestral thirst  vengeance gitche manito  mighty the creator   nations looked upon them  compassion with paternal love  pity looked upon their wrath  wrangling but  quarrels among children but  feuds  fights  children over them  stretched his right hand to subdue their stubborn natures to allay their thirst  fever by  shadow  his right hand spake  them  voice majestic as  sound  faroff waters falling into deep abysses warning chiding spake  this wise “o my children my poor children listen   words  wisdom listen   words  warning from  lips   great spirit from  master  life who made you “i have given you lands  hunt in i have given you streams  fish in i have given you bear  bison i have given you roe  reindeer i have given you brant  beaver filled  marshes full  wildfowl filled  rivers full  fishes why then  you not contented why then  you hunt each other “i am weary  your quarrels weary  your wars  bloodshed weary  your prayers  vengeance of your wranglings  dissensions all your strength   your union all your danger   discord therefore   peace henceforward and  brothers live together “i  send  prophet  you a deliverer   nations who shall guide you  shall teach you who shall toil  suffer  you if you listen  his counsels you  multiply  prosper if his warnings pass unheeded you  fade away  perish “bathe now   stream before you wash  warpaint  your faces wash  bloodstains  your fingers bury your warclubs  your weapons break  red stone  this quarry mould  make  into peacepipes take  reeds  grow beside you deck them  your brightest feathers smoke  calumet together and  brothers live henceforward” then upon  ground  warriors threw their cloaks  shirts  deerskin threw their weapons  their wargear leaped into  rushing river washed  warpaint  their faces clear above them flowed  water clear  limpid   footprints of  master  life descending dark below them flowed  water soiled  stained  streaks  crimson as if blood  mingled  it from  river came  warriors clean  washed  all their warpaint on  banks their clubs they buried buried all their warlike weapons gitche manito  mighty the great spirit  creator smiled upon his helpless children and  silence all  warriors broke  red stone   quarry smoothed  formed  into peacepipes broke  long reeds   river decked them  their brightest feathers and departed each one homeward while  master  life ascending through  opening  cloudcurtains through  doorways   heaven vanished  before their faces in  smoke  rolled around him the pukwana   peacepipe ii the four winds “honor   mudjekeewis” cried  warriors cried  old men when  came  triumph homeward with  sacred belt  wampum from  regions   northwind from  kingdom  wabasso from  land   white rabbit he had stolen  belt  wampum from  neck  mishemokwa from  great bear   mountains from  terror   nations as  lay asleep  cumbrous on  summit   mountains like  rock  mosses  it spotted brown  gray  mosses silently  stole upon him till  red nails   monster almost touched him almost scared him till  hot breath  his nostrils warmed  hands  mudjekeewis as  drew  belt  wampum over  round ears  heard not over  small eyes  saw not over  long nose  nostrils the black muffle   nostrils out  which  heavy breathing warmed  hands  mudjekeewis then  swung aloft his warclub shouted loud  long his warcry smote  mighty mishemokwa in  middle   forehead right between  eyes  smote him with  heavy blow bewildered rose  great bear   mountains but his knees beneath him trembled and  whimpered like  woman as  reeled  staggered forward as  sat upon his haunches and  mighty mudjekeewis standing fearlessly before him taunted him  loud derision spake disdainfully  this wise “hark you bear you   coward and no brave  you pretended else you would not cry  whimper like  miserable woman bear you know our tribes  hostile long have been  war together now you find  we  strongest you go sneaking   forest you go hiding   mountains had you conquered me  battle not  groan would i have uttered but you bear sit here  whimper and disgrace your tribe  crying like  wretched shaugodaya like  cowardly old woman” then again  raised his warclub smote again  mishemokwa in  middle  his forehead broke his skull  ice  broken when one goes  fish  winter thus  slain  mishemokwa he  great bear   mountains he  terror   nations “honor   mudjekeewis” with  shout exclaimed  people “honor   mudjekeewis henceforth  shall   westwind and hereafter  forever shall  hold supreme dominion over all  winds  heaven call him no more mudjekeewis call him kabeyun  westwind” thus  mudjekeewis chosen father   winds  heaven for himself  kept  westwind gave  others  his children unto wabun gave  eastwind gave  south  shawondasee and  northwind wild  cruel to  fierce kabibonokka young  beautiful  wabun he   who brought  morning he   whose silver arrows chased  dark o’er hill  valley he   whose cheeks  painted with  brightest streaks  crimson and whose voice awoke  village called  deer  called  hunter lonely   sky  wabun though  birds sang gayly  him though  wildflowers   meadow filled  air  odors  him though  forests   rivers sang  shouted  his coming still his heart  sad within him for   alone  heaven but one morning gazing earthward while  village still  sleeping and  fog lay   river like  ghost  goes  sunrise he beheld  maiden walking all alone upon  meadow gathering waterflags  rushes by  river   meadow every morning gazing earthward still  first thing  beheld there was her blue eyes looking  him two blue lakes among  rushes and  loved  lonely maiden who thus waited  his coming for they both  solitary she  earth    heaven and  wooed her  caresses wooed her  his smile  sunshine with his flattering words  wooed her with his sighing  his singing gentlest whispers   branches softest music sweetest odors till  drew her  his bosom folded  his robes  crimson till into  star  changed her trembling still upon his bosom and forever   heavens they  seen together walking wabun   wabunannung wabun   star  morning but  fierce kabibonokka had his dwelling among icebergs in  everlasting snowdrifts in  kingdom  wabasso in  land   white rabbit he   whose hand  autumn painted all  trees  scarlet stained  leaves  red  yellow he   who sent  snowflake sifting hissing through  forest froze  ponds  lakes  rivers drove  loon  seagull southward drove  cormorant  curlew to their nests  sedge  seatang in  realms  shawondasee once  fierce kabibonokka issued  his lodge  snowdrifts from his home among  icebergs and his hair  snow besprinkled streamed behind him like  river like  black  wintry river as  howled  hurried southward over frozen lakes  moorlands there among  reeds  rushes found  shingebis  diver trailing strings  fish behind him o’er  frozen fens  moorlands lingering still among  moorlands though his tribe had long departed to  land  shawondasee cried  fierce kabibonokka “who  this  dares  brave me dares  stay  my dominions when  wawa  departed when  wildgoose  gone southward and  heron  shuhshuhgah long ago departed southward i  go into his wigwam i  put his smouldering fire out” and  night kabibonokka to  lodge came wild  wailing heaped  snow  drifts about it shouted down into  smokeflue shook  lodgepoles  his fury flapped  curtain   doorway shingebis  diver feared not shingebis  diver cared not four great logs had   firewood one  each moon   winter and  food  fishes served him by his blazing fire  sat there warm  merry eating laughing singing “o kabibonokka you  but my fellowmortal” then kabibonokka entered and though shingebis  diver felt his presence   coldness felt his icy breath upon him still  did not cease his singing still  did not leave his laughing only turned  log  little only made  fire burn brighter made  sparks fly up  smokeflue from kabibonokka’s forehead from his snowbesprinkled tresses drops  sweat fell fast  heavy making dints upon  ashes as along  eaves  lodges as  drooping boughs  hemlock drips  melting snow  springtime making hollows   snowdrifts till  last  rose defeated could not bear  heat  laughter could not bear  merry singing but rushed headlong through  doorway stamped upon  crusted snowdrifts stamped upon  lakes  rivers made  snow upon them harder made  ice upon them thicker challenged shingebis  diver to come forth  wrestle  him to come forth  wrestle naked on  frozen fens  moorlands forth went shingebis  diver wrestled all night   northwind wrestled naked   moorlands with  fierce kabibonokka till his panting breath grew fainter till his frozen grasp grew feebler till  reeled  staggered backward and retreated baffled beaten to  kingdom  wabasso to  land   white rabbit hearing still  gusty laughter hearing shingebis  diver singing “o kabibonokka you  but my fellowmortal” shawondasee fat  lazy had his dwelling far  southward in  drowsy dreamy sunshine in  neverending summer he   who sent  woodbirds sent  robin  opechee sent  bluebird  owaissa sent  shawshaw sent  swallow sent  wildgoose wawa northward sent  melons  tobacco and  grapes  purple clusters from his pipe  smoke ascending filled  sky  haze  vapor filled  air  dreamy softness gave  twinkle   water touched  rugged hills  smoothness brought  tender indian summer to  melancholy northland in  dreary moon  snowshoes listless careless shawondasee in his life  had one shadow in his heart one sorrow had he once    gazing northward far away upon  prairie he beheld  maiden standing saw  tall  slender maiden all alone upon  prairie brightest green  all her garments and her hair  like  sunshine day  day  gazed upon her day  day  sighed  passion day  day his heart within him grew more hot  love  longing for  maid  yellow tresses but   too fat  lazy to bestir himself  woo her yes too indolent  easy to pursue her  persuade her so  only gazed upon her only sat  sighed  passion for  maiden   prairie till one morning looking northward he beheld her yellow tresses changed  covered o’er  whiteness covered   whitest snowflakes “ah my brother   northland from  kingdom  wabasso from  land   white rabbit you have stolen  maiden  me you have laid your hand upon her you have wooed  won my maiden with your stories   northland” thus  wretched shawondasee breathed into  air his sorrow and  southwind o’er  prairie wandered warm  sighs  passion with  sighs  shawondasee till  air seemed full  snowflakes full  thistledown  prairie and  maid  hair like sunshine vanished  his sight forever never more did shawondasee see  maid  yellow tresses poor deluded shawondasee ’t  no woman  you gazed at ’t  no maiden  you sighed for ’t   prairie dandelion that through all  dreamy summer you had gazed   such longing you had sighed   such passion and had puffed away forever blown into  air  sighing ah deluded shawondasee thus  four winds  divided thus  sons  mudjekeewis had their stations   heavens at  corners   heavens for himself  westwind only kept  mighty mudjekeewis iii hiawatha’s childhood downward through  evening twilight in  days   forgotten in  unremembered ages from  full moon fell nokomis fell  beautiful nokomis she  wife but not  mother she  sporting  her women swinging   swing  grapevines when her rival  rejected full  jealousy  hatred cut  leafy swing asunder cut  twain  twisted grapevines and nokomis fell affrighted downward through  evening twilight on  muskoday  meadow on  prairie full  blossoms “see  star falls” said  people “from  sky  star  falling” there among  ferns  mosses there among  prairie lilies on  muskoday  meadow in  moonlight   starlight fair nokomis bore  daughter and she called her name wenonah as  firstborn  her daughters and  daughter  nokomis grew up like  prairie lilies grew  tall  slender maiden with  beauty   moonlight with  beauty   starlight and nokomis warned her often saying oft  oft repeating “oh beware  mudjekeewis of  westwind mudjekeewis listen not  what  tells you lie not down upon  meadow stoop not down among  lilies lest  westwind come  harm you” but she heeded not  warning heeded not those words  wisdom and  westwind came  evening walking lightly o’er  prairie whispering   leaves  blossoms bending low  flowers  grasses found  beautiful wenonah lying there among  lilies wooed her  his words  sweetness wooed her  his soft caresses till she bore  son  sorrow bore  son  love  sorrow thus  born my hiawatha thus  born  child  wonder but  daughter  nokomis hiawatha’s gentle mother in her anguish died deserted by  westwind false  faithless by  heartless mudjekeewis for her daughter long  loudly wailed  wept  sad nokomis “oh  i  dead” she murmured “oh  i  dead  thou art no more work  no more weeping wahonowin wahonowin” by  shores  gitche gumee by  shining bigseawater stood  wigwam  nokomis daughter   moon nokomis dark behind  rose  forest rose  black  gloomy pinetrees rose  firs  cones upon them bright before  beat  water beat  clear  sunny water beat  shining bigseawater there  wrinkled old nokomis nursed  little hiawatha rocked him  his linden cradle bedded soft  moss  rushes safely bound  reindeer sinews stilled his fretful wail  saying “hush  naked bear  hear thee” lulled him into slumber singing “ewayea my little owlet who  this  lights  wigwam with his great eyes lights  wigwam ewayea my little owlet” many things nokomis taught him of  stars  shine  heaven showed him ishkoodah  comet ishkoodah  fiery tresses showed  deathdance   spirits warriors  their plumes  warclubs flaring far away  northward in  frosty nights  winter showed  broad white road  heaven pathway   ghosts  shadows running straight across  heavens crowded   ghosts  shadows at  door  summer evenings sat  little hiawatha heard  whispering   pinetrees heard  lapping   waters sounds  music words  wonder “minnewawa” said  pinetrees “mudwayaushka” said  water saw  firefly wahwahtaysee flitting through  dusk  evening with  twinkle   candle lighting up  brakes  bushes and  sang  song  children sang  song nokomis taught him “wahwahtaysee little firefly little flitting whitefire insect little dancing whitefire creature light me  your little candle ere upon my bed i lay me ere  sleep i close my eyelids” saw  moon rise   water rippling rounding   water saw  flecks  shadows  it whispered “what  that nokomis” and  good nokomis answered “once  warrior very angry seized his grandmother  threw her up into  sky  midnight right against  moon  threw her ’t  her body  you see there” saw  rainbow   heaven in  eastern sky  rainbow whispered “what  that nokomis” and  good nokomis answered “’t   heaven  flowers you see there all  wildflowers   forest all  lilies   prairie when  earth they fade  perish blossom   heaven above us” when  heard  owls  midnight hooting laughing   forest “what  that”  cried  terror “what  that”  said “nokomis” and  good nokomis answered “that  but  owl  owlet talking  their native language talking scolding  each other” then  little hiawatha learned  every bird  language learned their names  all their secrets how they built their nests  summer where they hid themselves  winter talked  them whene’er  met them called them “hiawatha’s chickens” of all beasts  learned  language learned their names  all their secrets how  beavers built their lodges where  squirrels hid their acorns how  reindeer ran so swiftly why  rabbit  so timid talked  them whene’er  met them called them “hiawatha’s brothers” then iagoo  great boaster he  marvellous storyteller he  traveller   talker he  friend  old nokomis made  bow  hiawatha from  branch  ash  made it from  oakbough made  arrows tipped  flint  winged  feathers and  cord  made  deerskin then  said  hiawatha “go my son into  forest where  red deer herd together kill  us  famous roebuck kill  us  deer  antlers” forth into  forest straightway all alone walked hiawatha proudly  his bow  arrows and  birds sang round him o’er him “do not shoot us hiawatha” sang  robin  opechee sang  bluebird  owaissa “do not shoot us hiawatha” up  oaktree close beside him sprang  squirrel adjidaumo in  out among  branches coughed  chattered   oaktree laughed  said between his laughing “do not shoot me hiawatha” and  rabbit  his pathway leaped aside    distance sat erect upon his haunches half  fear  half  frolic saying   little hunter “do not shoot me hiawatha” but  heeded not nor heard them for his thoughts    red deer on their tracks his eyes  fastened leading downward   river to  ford across  river and  one  slumber walked he hidden   alderbushes there  waited till  deer came till  saw two antlers lifted saw two eyes look   thicket saw two nostrils point  windward and  deer came down  pathway flecked  leafy light  shadow and his heart within him fluttered trembled like  leaves above him like  birchleaf palpitated as  deer came down  pathway then upon one knee uprising hiawatha aimed  arrow scarce  twig moved  his motion scarce  leaf  stirred or rustled but  wary roebuck started stamped  all his hoofs together listened  one foot uplifted leaped  if  meet  arrow ah  singing fatal arrow like  wasp  buzzed  stung him dead  lay there   forest by  ford across  river beat his timid heart no longer but  heart  hiawatha throbbed  shouted  exulted as  bore  red deer homeward and iagoo  nokomis hailed his coming  applauses from  red deer’s hide nokomis made  cloak  hiawatha from  red deer’s flesh nokomis made  banquet  his honor all  village came  feasted all

deerskin when upon his hands  wore them he could smite  rocks asunder he could grind them into powder he had moccasins enchanted magic moccasins  deerskin when  bound them round his ankles when upon his feet  tied them at each stride  mile  measured much  questioned old nokomis of his father mudjekeewis learned  her  fatal secret of  beauty  his mother of  falsehood  his father and his heart  hot within him like  living coal his heart was then  said  old nokomis “i  go  mudjekeewis see how fares   my father at  doorways   westwind at  portals   sunset” from his lodge went hiawatha dressed  travel armed  hunting dressed  deerskin shirt  leggings richly wrought  quills  wampum on his head his eaglefeathers round his waist his belt  wampum in his hand his bow  ashwood strung  sinews   reindeer in his quiver oaken arrows tipped  jasper winged  feathers with his mittens minjekahwun with his moccasins enchanted warning said  old nokomis “go not forth o hiawatha to  kingdom   westwind to  realms  mudjekeewis lest  harm you  his magic lest  kill you  his cunning” but  fearless hiawatha heeded not her woman’s warning forth  strode into  forest at each stride  mile  measured lurid seemed  sky above him lurid seemed  earth beneath him hot  close  air around him filled  smoke  fiery vapors as  burning woods  prairies for his heart  hot within him like  living coal his heart was so  journeyed westward westward left  fleetest deer behind him left  antelope  bison crossed  rushing esconaba crossed  mighty mississippi passed  mountains   prairie passed  land  crows  foxes passed  dwellings   blackfeet came unto  rocky mountains to  kingdom   westwind where upon  gusty summits sat  ancient mudjekeewis ruler   winds  heaven filled  awe  hiawatha at  aspect  his father on  air about him wildly tossed  streamed his cloudy tresses gleamed like drifting snow his tresses glared like ishkoodah  comet like  star  fiery tresses filled  joy  mudjekeewis when  looked  hiawatha saw his youth rise up before him in  face  hiawatha saw  beauty  wenonah from  grave rise up before him “welcome” said he “hiawatha to  kingdom   westwind long have i been waiting  you youth  lovely age  lonely youth  fiery age  frosty you bring back  days departed you bring back my youth  passion and  beautiful wenonah” many days they talked together questioned listened waited answered much  mighty mudjekeewis boasted  his ancient prowess of his perilous adventures his indomitable courage his invulnerable body patiently sat hiawatha listening  his father’s boasting with  smile  sat  listened uttered neither threat nor menace neither word nor look betrayed him but his heart  hot within him like  living coal his heart was then  said “o mudjekeewis is there nothing  can harm you nothing  you  afraid of” and  mighty mudjekeewis grand  gracious  his boasting answered saying “there  nothing nothing but  black rock yonder nothing but  fatal wawbeek” and  looked  hiawatha with  wise look  benignant with  countenance paternal looked  pride upon  beauty of his tall  graceful figure saying “o my hiawatha is there anything can harm you anything you  afraid of” but  wary hiawatha paused awhile  if uncertain held his peace  if resolving and then answered “there  nothing nothing but  bulrush yonder nothing but  great apukwa” and  mudjekeewis rising stretched his hand  pluck  bulrush hiawatha cried  terror cried  welldissembled terror “kago kago do not touch it” “ah kaween” said mudjekeewis “no indeed i  not touch it” then they talked  other matters first  hiawatha’s brothers first  wabun   eastwind of  southwind shawondasee of  north kabibonokka then  hiawatha’s mother of  beautiful wenonah of her birth upon  meadow of her death  old nokomis had remembered  related and  cried “o mudjekeewis it  you who killed wenonah took her young life  her beauty broke  lily   prairie trampled  beneath your footsteps you confess it you confess it” and  mighty mudjekeewis tossed upon  wind his tresses bowed his hoary head  anguish with  silent nod assented then up started hiawatha and  threatening look  gesture laid his hand upon  black rock on  fatal wawbeek laid it with his mittens minjekahwun rent  jutting crag asunder smote  crushed  into fragments hurled them madly  his father the remorseful mudjekeewis for his heart  hot within him like  living coal his heart was but  ruler   westwind blew  fragments backward  him with  breathing  his nostrils with  tempest  his anger blew them back  his assailant seized  bulrush  apukwa dragged    roots  fibres from  margin   meadow from  ooze  giant bulrush long  loud laughed hiawatha then began  deadly conflict hand  hand among  mountains from his eyry screamed  eagle the keneu  great wareagle sat upon  crags around them wheeling flapped his wings above them like  tall tree   tempest bent  lashed  giant bulrush and  masses huge  heavy crashing fell  fatal wawbeek till  earth shook   tumult and confusion   battle and  air  full  shoutings and  thunder   mountains starting answered “baimwawa” back retreated mudjekeewis rushing westward o’er  mountains stumbling westward down  mountains three whole days retreated

said  arrows not  word  laughing water v hiawatha’s fasting you shall hear how hiawatha prayed  fasted   forest not  greater skill  hunting not  greater craft  fishing not  triumphs   battle and renown among  warriors but  profit   people for advantage   nations first  built  lodge  fasting built  wigwam   forest by  shining bigseawater in  blithe  pleasant springtime in  moon  leaves  built it and  dreams  visions many seven whole days  nights  fasted on  first day  his fasting through  leafy woods  wandered saw  deer start   thicket saw  rabbit  his burrow heard  pheasant bena drumming heard  squirrel adjidaumo rattling  his hoard  acorns saw  pigeon  omeme building nests among  pinetrees and  flocks  wildgoose wawa flying   fenlands northward whirring wailing far above him “master  life”  cried desponding “must our lives depend  these things” on  next day  his fasting by  river’s brink  wandered through  muskoday  meadow saw  wild rice mahnomonee saw  blueberry meenahga and  strawberry odahmin and  gooseberry shahbomin and  grapevine  bemahgut trailing o’er  alderbranches filling all  air  fragrance “master  life”  cried desponding “must our lives depend  these things” on  third day  his fasting by  lake  sat  pondered by  still transparent water saw  sturgeon nahma leaping scattering drops like beads  wampum saw  yellow perch  sahwa like  sunbeam   water saw  pike  maskenozha and  herring okahahwis and  shawgashee  crawfish “master  life”  cried desponding “must our lives depend  these things” on  fourth day  his fasting in his lodge  lay exhausted from his couch  leaves  branches gazing  halfopen eyelids full  shadowy dreams  visions on  dizzy swimming landscape on  gleaming   water on  splendor   sunset and  saw  youth approaching dressed  garments green  yellow coming through  purple twilight through  splendor   sunset plumes  green bent o’er his forehead and his hair  soft  golden standing   open doorway long  looked  hiawatha looked  pity  compassion on his wasted form  features and  accents like  sighing of  southwind   treetops said he “o my hiawatha all your prayers  heard  heaven for you pray not like  others not  greater skill  hunting not  greater craft  fishing not  triumph   battle nor renown among  warriors but  profit   people for advantage   nations “from  master  life descending i  friend  man mondamin come  warn you  instruct you how  struggle   labor you shall gain what you have prayed for rise up  your bed  branches rise o youth  wrestle  me” faint  famine hiawatha started  his bed  branches from  twilight  his wigwam forth into  flush  sunset came  wrestled  mondamin at his touch  felt new courage throbbing  his brain  bosom felt new life  hope  vigor run through every nerve  fibre so they wrestled there together in  glory   sunset and  more they strove  struggled stronger still grew hiawatha till  darkness fell around them and  heron  shuhshuhgah from her nest among  pinetrees gave  cry  lamentation gave  scream  pain  famine “’t  enough” then said mondamin smiling upon hiawatha “but tomorrow when  sun sets i  come again  try you” and  vanished   seen not whether sinking   rain sinks whether rising   mists rise hiawatha saw not knew not only saw   had vanished leaving him alone  fainting with  misty lake below him and  reeling stars above him on  morrow   next day when  sun through heaven descending like  red  burning cinder from  hearth   great spirit fell into  western waters came mondamin   trial for  strife  hiawatha came  silent   dew comes from  empty air appearing into empty air returning taking shape when earth  touches but invisible  all men in  coming   going thrice they wrestled there together in  glory   sunset till  darkness fell around them till  heron  shuhshuhgah from her nest among  pinetrees uttered her loud cry  famine and mondamin paused  listen tall  beautiful  stood there in his garments green  yellow to  fro his plumes above him waved  nodded  his breathing and  sweat   encounter stood like drops  dew upon him and  cried “o hiawatha bravely have you wrestled  me thrice have wrestled stoutly  me and  master  life who sees us he  give  you  triumph” then  smiled  said “tomorrow is  last day  your conflict is  last day  your fasting you  conquer  o’ercome me make  bed  me  lie in where  rain may fall upon me where  sun may come  warm me strip these garments green  yellow strip this nodding plumage  me lay me   earth  make  soft  loose  light above me “let no hand disturb my slumber let no weed nor worm molest me let not kahgahgee  raven come  haunt me  molest me only come yourself  watch me till i wake  start  quicken till i leap into  sunshine” and thus saying  departed peacefully slept hiawatha but  heard  wawonaissa heard  whippoorwill complaining perched upon his lonely wigwam heard  rushing sebowisha heard  rivulet rippling near him talking   darksome forest heard  sighing   branches as they lifted  subsided at  passing   nightwind heard them  one hears  slumber faroff murmurs dreamy whispers peacefully slept hiawatha on  morrow came nokomis on  seventh day  his fasting came  food  hiawatha came imploring  bewailing lest his hunger should o’ercome him lest his fasting should  fatal but  tasted not  touched not only said  her “nokomis wait until  sun  setting till  darkness falls around us till  heron  shuhshuhgah crying   desolate marshes tells us   day  ended” homeward weeping went nokomis sorrowing  her hiawatha fearing lest his strength should fail him lest his fasting should  fatal he meanwhile sat weary waiting for  coming  mondamin till  shadows pointing eastward lengthened over field  forest till  sun dropped   heaven floating   waters westward as  red leaf   autumn falls  floats upon  water falls  sinks into  bosom and behold  young mondamin with his soft  shining tresses with his garments green  yellow with his long  glossy plumage stood  beckoned   doorway and  one  slumber walking pale  haggard but undaunted from  wigwam hiawatha came  wrestled  mondamin round about him spun  landscape sky  forest reeled together and his strong heart leaped within him as  sturgeon leaps  struggles in  net  break  meshes like  ring  fire around him blazed  flared  red horizon and  hundred suns seemed looking at  combat   wrestlers suddenly upon  greensward all alone stood hiawatha panting  his wild exertion palpitating   struggle and before him breathless lifeless lay  youth  hair dishevelled plumage torn  garments tattered dead  lay there   sunset and victorious hiawatha made  grave   commanded stripped  garments  mondamin stripped his tattered plumage  him laid him   earth  made  soft  loose  light above him and  heron  shuhshuhgah from  melancholy moorlands gave  cry  lamentation gave  cry  pain  anguish homeward then went hiawatha to  lodge  old nokomis and  seven days  his fasting were accomplished  completed but  place  not forgotten where  wrestled  mondamin nor forgotten nor neglected was  grave where lay mondamin sleeping   rain  sunshine where his scattered plumes  garments faded   rain  sunshine day  day did hiawatha go  wait  watch beside it kept  dark mould soft above it kept  clean  weeds  insects drove away  scoffs  shoutings kahgahgee  king  ravens till  length  small green feather from  earth shot slowly upward then another  another and before  summer ended stood  maize  all  beauty with  shining robes about it and  long soft yellow tresses and  rapture hiawatha cried aloud “it  mondamin yes  friend  man mondamin” then  called  old nokomis and iagoo  great boaster showed them where  maize  growing told them  his wondrous vision of his wrestling  his triumph of this new gift   nations which should  their food forever and still later when  autumn changed  long green leaves  yellow and  soft  juicy kernels grew like wampum hard  yellow then  ripened ears  gathered stripped  withered husks  off them as  once had stripped  wrestler gave  first feast  mondamin and made known unto  people this new gift   great spirit vi hiawatha’s friends two good friends had hiawatha singled out  all  others bound  him  closest union and  whom  gave  right hand of his heart  joy  sorrow chibiabos  musician and  very strong man kwasind straight between them ran  pathway never grew  grass upon it singing birds  utter falsehoods storytellers mischiefmakers found no eager ear  listen could not breed illwill between them for they kept each other’s counsel spake  naked hearts together pondering much  much contriving how  tribes  men might prosper most beloved  hiawatha was  gentle chibiabos he  best  all musicians he  sweetest  all singers beautiful  childlike  he brave  man is soft  woman pliant   wand  willow stately   deer  antlers when  sang  village listened all  warriors gathered round him all  women came  hear him now  stirred their souls  passion now  melted them  pity from  hollow reeds  fashioned flutes so musical  mellow that  brook  sebowisha ceased  murmur   woodland that  woodbirds ceased  singing and  squirrel adjidaumo ceased his chatter   oaktree and  rabbit  wabasso sat upright  look  listen yes  brook  sebowisha pausing said “o chibiabos teach my waves  flow  music softly  your words  singing” yes  bluebird  owaissa envious said “o chibiabos teach me tones  wild  wayward teach me songs  full  frenzy” yes  robin  opechee joyous said “o chibiabos teach me tones  sweet  tender teach me songs  full  gladness” and  whippoorwill wawonaissa sobbing said “o chibiabos teach me tones  melancholy

death  life undying in  islands   blessed in  kingdom  ponemah in  land   hereafter very dear  hiawatha was  gentle chibiabos he  best  all musicians he  sweetest  all singers for his gentleness  loved him and  magic  his singing dear too unto hiawatha was  very strong man kwasind he  strongest  all mortals he  mightiest among many for his very strength  loved him for his strength allied  goodness idle  his youth  kwasind very listless dull  dreamy never played  other children never fished  never hunted not like other children  he but they saw  much  fasted much his manito entreated much besought his guardian spirit “lazy kwasind” said his mother “in my work you never help me in  summer you  roaming idly   fields  forests in  winter you  cowering o’er  firebrands   wigwam in  coldest days  winter i must break  ice  fishing with my nets you never help me at  door my nets  hanging dripping freezing   water go  wring them yenadizze go  dry them   sunshine” slowly   ashes kwasind rose but made no angry answer from  lodge went forth  silence took  nets  hung together dripping freezing   doorway like  wisp  straw  wrung them like  wisp  straw  broke them could not wring them without breaking such  strength   his fingers “lazy kwasind” said his father “in  hunt you never help me every bow you touch  broken snapped asunder every arrow yet come  me   forest you shall bring  hunting homeward” down  narrow pass they wandered where  brooklet led them onward where  trail  deer  bison marked  soft mud   margin till they found all further passage shut against them barred securely by  trunks  trees uprooted lying lengthwise lying crosswise and forbidding further passage “we must go back” said  old man “o’er these logs we cannot clamber not  woodchuck could get through them not  squirrel clamber o’er them” and straightway his pipe  lighted and sat down  smoke  ponder but before his pipe  finished lo  path  cleared before him all  trunks had kwasind lifted to  right hand   left hand shot  pinetrees swift  arrows hurled  cedars light  lances “lazy kwasind” said  young men as they sported   meadow “why stand idly looking  us leaning   rock behind you come  wrestle   others let us pitch  quoit together” lazy kwasind made no answer to their challenge made no answer only rose  slowly turning seized  huge rock  his fingers tore    deep foundation poised    air  moment pitched  sheer into  river sheer into  swift pauwating where  still  seen  summer once  down  foaming river down  rapids  pauwating kwasind sailed  his companions in  stream  saw  beaver saw ahmeek  king  beavers struggling   rushing currents rising sinking   water without speaking without pausing kwasind leaped into  river plunged beneath  bubbling surface through  whirlpools chased  beaver followed him among  islands stayed so long beneath  water that his terrified companions cried “alas goodby  kwasind we shall never more see kwasind” but  reappeared triumphant and upon his shining shoulders brought  beaver dead  dripping brought  king  all  beavers and these two  i have told you were  friends  hiawatha chibiabos  musician and  very strong man kwasind long they lived  peace together spake  naked hearts together pondering much  much contriving how  tribes  men might prosper vii hiawatha’s sailing “give me  your bark o birchtree of your yellow bark o birchtree growing   rushing river tall  stately   valley i  light canoe  build me build  swift cheemaun  sailing that shall float upon  river like  yellow leaf  autumn like  yellow waterlily “lay aside your cloak o birchtree lay aside your whiteskin wrapper for  summertime  coming and  sun  warm  heaven and you need no whiteskin wrapper” thus aloud cried hiawatha in  solitary forest by  rushing taquamenaw when  birds  singing gayly in  moon  leaves  singing and  sun  sleep awaking started up  said “behold me gheezis  great sun behold me” and  tree  all  branches rustled   breeze  morning saying   sigh  patience “take my cloak o hiawatha” with his knife  tree  girdled just beneath  lowest branches just above  roots  cut it till  sap came oozing outward down  trunk  top  bottom sheer  cleft  bark asunder with  wooden wedge  raised it stripped    trunk unbroken “give me  your boughs o cedar of your strong  pliant branches my canoe  make more steady make more strong  firm beneath me” through  summit   cedar went  sound  cry  horror went  murmur  resistance but  whispered bending downward “take my boughs o hiawatha” down  hewed  boughs  cedar shaped them straightway   framework like two bows  formed  shaped them like two bended bows together “give me  your roots o tamarack of your fibrous roots o larchtree my canoe  bind together so  bind  ends together that  water may not enter that  river may not wet me” and  larch  all  fibres shivered   air  morning touched his forehead   tassels slid  one long sigh  sorrow “take them all o hiawatha” from  earth  tore  fibres tore  tough roots   larchtree closely sewed  bark together bound  closely   framework “give me  your balm o firtree of your balsam  your resin so  close  seams together that  water may not enter that  river may not wet me” and  firtree tall  sombre sobbed through all  robes  darkness rattled like  shore  pebbles answered wailing answered weeping “take my balm o hiawatha” and  took  tears  balsam took  resin   firtree smeared therewith each seam  fissure made each crevice safe  water “give me  your quills o hedgehog all your quills o kagh  hedgehog i  make  necklace  them make  girdle  my beauty and two stars  deck her bosom” from  hollow tree  hedgehog with his sleepy eyes looked  him shot his shining quills like arrows saying   drowsy murmur through  tangle  his whiskers “take my quills o hiawatha” from  ground  quills  gathered all  little shining arrows stained them red  blue  yellow with  juice  roots  berries into his canoe  wrought them round  waist  shining girdle round  bows  gleaming necklace on  breast two stars resplendent thus  birch canoe  builded in  valley   river in  bosom   forest and  forest’s life   it all  mystery   magic all  lightness   birchtree all  toughness   cedar all  larch’s supple sinews and  floated   river like  yellow leaf  autumn like  yellow waterlily paddles none had hiawatha paddles none  had or needed for his thoughts  paddles served him and his wishes served  guide him swift or slow    glided veered  right or left  pleasure then  called aloud  kwasind to his friend  strong man kwasind saying “help me clear this river of  sunken logs  sandbars” straight into  river kwasind plunged  if    otter dived  if    beaver stood up  his waist  water to his armpits   river swam  scouted   river tugged  sunken logs  branches with his hands  scooped  sandbars with his feet  ooze  tangle and thus sailed my hiawatha down  rushing taquamenaw sailed through all  bends  windings sailed through all  deeps  shallows while his friend  strong man kwasind swam  deeps  shallows waded up  down  river went they in  out among  islands cleared  bed  root  sandbar dragged  dead trees   channel made  passage safe  certain made  pathway   people from  springs among  mountains to  waters  pauwating to  bay  taquamenaw viii hiawatha’s fishing forth upon  gitche gumee on  shining bigseawater with his fishingline  cedar of  twisted bark  cedar forth  catch  sturgeon nahma mishenahma king  fishes in his birch canoe exulting all alone went hiawatha through  clear transparent water he could see  fishes swimming far down   depths below him see  yellow perch  sahwa like  sunbeam   water see  shawgashee  crawfish like  spider   bottom on  white  sandy bottom at  stern sat hiawatha with his fishingline  cedar in his plumes  breeze  morning played    hemlock branches on  bows  tail erected sat  squirrel adjidaumo in his fur  breeze  morning played    prairie grasses on  white sand   bottom lay  monster mishenahma lay  sturgeon king  fishes through his gills  breathed  water with his fins  fanned  winnowed with his tail  swept  sandfloor there  lay  all his armor on each side  shield  guard him plates  bone upon his forehead down his sides  back  shoulders plates  bone  spines projecting painted    his warpaints stripes  yellow red  azure spots  brown  spots  sable and  lay there   bottom fanning  his fins  purple as above him hiawatha in his birch canoe came sailing with his fishingline  cedar “take my bait” cried hiawatha dawn into  depths beneath him “take my bait o sturgeon nahma come up  below  water let us see which   stronger” and  dropped his line  cedar through  clear transparent water waited vainly   answer long sat waiting   answer and repeating loud  louder “take my bait o king  fishes” quiet lay  sturgeon nahma fanning slowly   water looking up  hiawatha listening  his call  clamor his unnecessary tumult till  wearied   shouting and  said   kenozha to  pike  maskenozha “take  bait  this rude fellow break  line  hiawatha” in his fingers hiawatha felt  loose line jerk  tighten as  drew  in  tugged so that  birch canoe stood endwise like  birch log   water with  squirrel adjidaumo perched  frisking   summit full  scorn  hiawatha when  saw  fish rise upward saw  pike  maskenozha coming nearer nearer  him and  shouted through  water “esa esa shame upon you you  but  pike kenozha you  not  fish i wanted you  not  king  fishes” reeling downward   bottom sank  pike  great confusion and  mighty sturgeon nahma said  ugudwash  sunfish to  bream  scales  crimson “take  bait  this great boaster break  line  hiawatha” slowly upward wavering gleaming rose  ugudwash  sunfish seized  line  hiawatha swung  all his weight upon it made  whirlpool   water whirled  birch canoe  circles round  round  gurgling eddies till  circles   water reached  faroff sandy beaches till  waterflags  rushes nodded   distant margins but when hiawatha saw him slowly rising through  water lifting up his disk refulgent loud  shouted  derision “esa esa shame upon you you  ugudwash  sunfish you  not  fish i wanted you  not  king  fishes” slowly downward wavering gleaming sank  ugudwash  sunfish and again  sturgeon nahma heard  shout  hiawatha heard his challenge  defiance the unnecessary tumult ringing far across  water from  white sand   bottom up  rose  angry gesture quivering  each nerve  fibre clashing all his plates  armor gleaming bright  all his warpaint in his wrath  darted upward flashing leaped into  sunshine opened his great jaws  swallowed both canoe  hiawatha down into  darksome cavern plunged  headlong hiawatha as  log  some black river shoots  plunges down  rapids found himself  utter darkness groped about  helpless wonder till  felt  great heart beating throbbing   utter darkness and  smote   his anger with his fist  heart  nahma felt  mighty king  fishes shudder through each nerve  fibre heard  water gurgle round him as  leaped  staggered through it sick  heart  faint  weary crosswise then did hiawatha drag his birchcanoe  safety lest  out  jaws  nahma in  turmoil  confusion forth  might  hurled  perish and  squirrel adjidaumo frisked  chatted very gayly toiled  tugged  hiawatha till  labor  completed then said hiawatha  him “o my little friend  squirrel bravely have you toiled  help me take  thanks  hiawatha and  name which now  gives you for hereafter  forever boys shall call you adjidaumo tailinair  boys shall call you” and again  sturgeon nahma gasped  quivered   water then  still  drifted landward till  grated   pebbles till  listening hiawatha heard him grate upon  margin felt him strand upon  pebbles knew  nahma king  fishes lay there dead upon  margin then  heard  clang  flapping as  many wings assembling heard  screaming  confusion as  birds  prey contending saw  gleam  light above him shining through  ribs  nahma saw  glittering eyes  seagulls of kayoshk  seagulls peering gazing  him through  opening heard them saying  each other “’t  our brother hiawatha” and  shouted  below them cried exulting   caverns “o ye seagulls o my brothers i have slain  sturgeon nahma make  rifts  little larger with your claws  openings widen set me free  this dark prison and henceforward  forever men shall speak  your achievements calling you kayoshk  seagulls yes kayoshk  noble scratchers” and  wild  clamorous seagulls toiled  beak  claws together made  rifts  openings wider in  mighty ribs  nahma and  peril   prison from  body   sturgeon from  peril   water they released my hiawatha he  standing near his wigwam on  margin   water and  called  old nokomis called  beckoned  nokomis pointed   sturgeon nahma lying lifeless   pebbles with  seagulls feeding  him “i have slain  mishenahma slain  king  fishes” said he “look  seagulls feed upon him yes my friends kayoshk  seagulls drive them not away nokomis they have saved me  great peril in  body   sturgeon wait until their meal  ended till their craws  full  feasting till they homeward fly  sunset to their nests among  marshes then bring all your pots  kettles and make oil  us  winter” and she waited till  sun set till  pallid moon  nightsun rose above  tranquil water till kayoshk  sated seagulls from their banquet rose  clamor and across  fiery sunset winged their way  faroff islands to their nests among  rushes to his sleep went hiawatha and nokomis  her labor toiling patient   moonlight till  sun  moon changed places till  sky  red  sunrise and kayoshk  hungry seagulls came back   reedy islands clamorous  their morning banquet three whole days  nights alternate old nokomis   seagulls stripped  oily flesh  nahma till  waves washed through  ribbones till  seagulls came no longer and upon  sands lay nothing but  skeleton  nahma ix hiawatha   pearlfeather on  shores  gitche gumee of  shining bigseawater stood nokomis  old woman pointing  her finger westward o’er  water pointing westward to  purple clouds  sunset fiercely  red sun descending burned his way along  heavens set  sky  fire behind him as warparties when retreating burn  prairies  their wartrail and  moon  nightsun eastward suddenly starting  his ambush followed fast those bloody footprints followed   fiery wartrail with  glare upon his features and nokomis  old woman pointing  her finger westward spake these words  hiawatha “yonder dwells  great pearlfeather megissogwon  magician manito  wealth  wampum guarded  his fiery serpents guarded   black pitchwater you can see his fiery serpents the kenabeek  great serpents coiling playing   water you can see  black pitchwater stretching far away beyond them to  purple clouds  sunset “he   who slew my father by his wicked wiles  cunning when    moon descended when  came  earth  seek me he  mightiest  magicians sends  fever   marshes sends  pestilential vapors sends  poisonous exhalations sends  white fog   fenlands sends disease  death among us “take your bow o hiawatha take your arrows jasperheaded take your warclub puggawaugun and your mittens minjekahwun and your birchcanoe  sailing and  oil  mishenahma so  smear  sides  swiftly you may pass  black pitchwater slay this merciless magician save  people   fever that  breathes across  fenlands and avenge my father’s murder” straightway then my hiawatha armed himself  all his wargear launched his birchcanoe  sailing with his palm  sides  patted said  glee “cheemaun my darling o my birchcanoe leap forward where you see  fiery serpents where you see  black pitchwater” forward leaped cheemaun exulting and  noble hiawatha sang his warsong wild  woful and above him  wareagle the keneu  great wareagle master  all fowls  feathers screamed  hurtled through  heavens soon  reached  fiery serpents the kenabeek  great serpents lying huge upon  water sparkling rippling   water lying coiled across  passage with their blazing crests uplifted breathing fiery fogs  vapors so  none could pass beyond them but  fearless hiawatha cried aloud  spake  this wise “let me pass my way kenabeek let me go upon my journey” and they answered hissing fiercely with their fiery breath made answer “back go back o shaugodaya back  old nokomis faintheart” then  angry hiawatha raised his mighty bow  ashtree seized his arrows jasperheaded shot them fast among  serpents every twanging   bowstring was  warcry   deathcry every whizzing   arrow was  deathsong  kenabeek weltering   bloody water dead lay all  fiery serpents and among them hiawatha harmless sailed  cried exulting “onward o cheemaun my darling onward   black pitchwater” then  took  oil  nahma and  bows  sides anointed smeared them well  oil  swiftly he might pass  black pitchwater all night long  sailed upon it sailed upon  sluggish water covered   mould  ages black  rotting waterrushes rank  flags  leaves  lilies stagnant lifeless dreary dismal lighted   shimmering moonlight and  willo’thewisps illumined fires  ghosts  dead men kindled in their weary nightencampments all  air  white  moonlight all  water black  shadow and around him  suggema the mosquito sang his warsong and  fireflies wahwahtaysee waved their torches  mislead him and  bullfrog  dahinda thrust his head into  moonlight fixed his yellow eyes upon him sobbed  sank beneath  surface and anon  thousand whistles answered over all  fenlands and  heron  shuhshuhgah far off   reedy margin heralded  hero’s coming westward thus fared hiawatha toward  realm  megissogwon toward  land   pearlfeather till  level moon stared  him in his face stared pale  haggard till  sun  hot behind him till  burned upon his shoulders and before him   upland he could see  shining wigwam of  manito  wampum of  mightiest  magicians then once more cheemaun  patted to his birchcanoe said “onward” and  stirred  all  fibres and  one great bound  triumph leaped across  waterlilies leaped through tangled flags  rushes and upon  beach beyond them dryshod landed hiawatha straight  took his bow  ashtree on  sand one end  rested with his knee  pressed  middle stretched  faithful bowstring tighter took  arrow jasperheaded shot    shining wigwam sent  singing   herald as  bearer  his message of his challenge loud  lofty “come forth  your lodge pearlfeather hiawatha waits your coming” straightway   shining wigwam came  mighty megissogwon tall  stature broad  shoulder dark  terrible  aspect clad  head  foot  wampum armed  all his warlike weapons painted like  sky  morning streaked  crimson blue  yellow crested  great eaglefeathers streaming upward streaming outward “well i know you hiawatha” cried    voice  thunder in  tone  loud derision “hasten back o shaugodaya hasten back among  women back  old nokomis faintheart i  slay you  you stand there as  old i slew her father” but my hiawatha answered nothing daunted fearing nothing “big words do not smite like warclubs boastful breath  not  bowstring taunts  not so sharp  arrows deeds  better things than words are actions mightier than boastings” then began  greatest battle that  sun had ever looked on that  warbirds ever witnessed all  summer’s day  lasted from  sunrise   sunset for  shafts  hiawatha harmless hit  shirt  wampum harmless fell  blows  dealt  with his mittens minjekahwun harmless fell  heavy warclub it could dash  rocks asunder but  could not break  meshes of  magic shirt  wampum till  sunset hiawatha leaning  his bow  ashtree wounded weary  desponding with his mighty warclub broken with his mittens torn  tattered and three useless arrows only paused  rest beneath  pinetree from whose branches trailed  mosses and whose trunk  coated over with  deadman’s moccasinleather with  fungus white  yellow suddenly   boughs above him sang  mama  woodpecker “aim your arrows hiawatha at  head  megissogwon strike

thus dissuading spake nokomis and my hiawatha answered only this “dear old nokomis very pleasant   firelight but i like  starlight better better do i like  moonlight” gravely then said old nokomis “bring not here  idle maiden bring not here  useless woman hands unskilful feet unwilling bring  wife  nimble fingers heart  hand  move together feet  run  willing errands” smiling answered hiawatha

from  evening star descending” xii the son   evening star can    sun descending o’er  level plain  water or  red swan floating flying wounded   magic arrow staining all  waves  crimson with  crimson   lifeblood filling all  air  splendor with  splendor   plumage yes    sun descending sinking down into  water all  sky  stained  purple all  water flushed  crimson no    red swan floating diving down beneath  water to  sky  wings  lifted with  blood  waves  reddened over   star  evening melts  trembles through  purple hangs suspended   twilight no    bead  wampum on  robes   great spirit as

osseo “once  days no more remembered ages nearer  beginning when  heavens  closer  us and  gods  more familiar in  northland lived  hunter with ten young  comely daughters tall  lithe  wands  willow only oweenee  youngest she  wilful   wayward she  silent dreamy maiden was  fairest   sisters “all these women married warriors married brave  haughty husbands only oweenee  youngest laughed  flouted all her lovers all her young  handsome suitors and then married old osseo old osseo poor  ugly broken  age  weak  coughing always coughing like  squirrel “ah but beautiful within him was  spirit  osseo from  evening star descended star  evening star  woman star  tenderness  passion all  fire   his bosom all  beauty  his spirit all  mystery  his being all  splendor  his language “and her lovers  rejected handsome men  belts  wampum handsome men  paint  feathers pointed  her  derision followed her  jest  laughter but she said ‘i care not  you care not  your belts  wampum care not  your paint  feathers care not  your jests  laughter i am happy  osseo’ “once  some great feast invited through  damp  dusk  evening walked together  ten sisters walked together  their husbands slowly followed old osseo with fair oweenee beside him all  others chatted gayly these two only walked  silence “at  western sky osseo gazed intent  if imploring often stopped  gazed imploring at  trembling star  evening at  tender star  woman and they heard him murmur softly ‘ah showain nemeshin nosa pity pity me my father’ “‘listen’ said  eldest sister ‘he  praying  his father what  pity   old man does not stumble   pathway does not break his neck  falling’ and they laughed till all  forest rang  their unseemly laughter “on their pathway through  woodlands lay  oak  storms uprooted lay  great trunk   oaktree buried half  leaves  mosses mouldering crumbling huge  hollow and osseo when  saw it gave  shout  cry  anguish leaped into  yawning cavern at one end went   old man wasted wrinkled old  ugly from  other came  young man tall  straight  strong  handsome “thus osseo  transfigured thus restored  youth  beauty but alas  good osseo and  oweenee  faithful strangely too  she transfigured changed into  weak old woman with  staff she tottered onward wasted wrinkled old  ugly and  sisters  their husbands laughed until  echoing forest rang  their unseemly laughter “but osseo turned not  her walked  slower step beside her took her hand  brown  withered as  oakleaf   winter called her sweetheart nenemoosha soothed her  soft words  kindness till they reached  lodge  feasting till they sat down   wigwam sacred   star  evening to  tender star  woman “wrapt  visions lost  dreaming at  banquet sat osseo all  merry all  happy all  joyous but osseo neither food nor drink  tasted neither did  speak nor listen but  one bewildered sat he looking dreamily  sadly first  oweenee then upward at  gleaming sky above them “then  voice  heard  whisper coming   starry distance coming   empty vastness low  musical  tender and  voice said ‘o osseo o my son my best beloved broken   spells  bound you all  charms   magicians all  magic powers  evil come  me ascend osseo “‘taste  food  stands before you it  blessed  enchanted it  magic virtues  it it  change you   spirit all your bowls  all your kettles shall  wood  clay no longer but  bowls  changed  wampum and  kettles shall  silver they shall shine like shells  scarlet like  fire shall gleam  glimmer “‘and  women shall no longer bear  dreary doom  labor but  changed  birds  glisten with  beauty   starlight painted   dusky splendors of  skies  clouds  evening’ “what osseo heard  whispers what  words  comprehended was but music   others music   birds afar off of  whippoorwill afar off of  lonely wawonaissa singing   darksome forest “then  lodge began  tremble straight began  shake  tremble and they felt  rising rising slowly through  air ascending from  darkness   treetops forth into  dewy starlight till  passed  topmost branches and behold  wooden dishes all  changed  shells  scarlet and behold  earthen kettles all  changed  bowls  silver and  roofpoles   wigwam were  glittering rods  silver and  roof  bark upon them as  shining shards  beetles “then osseo gazed around him and  saw  nine fair sisters all  sisters  their husbands changed  birds  various plumage some  jays  some  magpies others thrushes others blackbirds and they hopped  sang  twittered perked  fluttered all their feathers strutted  their shining plumage and their tails like fans unfolded “only oweenee  youngest was not changed but sat  silence wasted wrinkled old  ugly looking sadly   others till osseo gazing upward gave another cry  anguish such  cry   had uttered by  oaktree   forest “then returned her youth  beauty and her soiled  tattered garments were transformed  robes  ermine and her staff became  feather yes  shining silver feather “and again  wigwam trembled swayed  rushed through airy currents through transparent cloud  vapor and amid celestial splendors on  evening star alighted as  snowflake falls  snowflake as  leaf drops   river as  thistledown  water “forth  cheerful words  welcome came  father  osseo he  radiant locks  silver he  eyes serene  tender and  said ‘my son osseo hang  cage  birds you bring there hang  cage  rods  silver and  birds  glistening feathers at  doorway  my wigwam’ “at  door  hung  birdcage and they entered   gladly listened  osseo’s father ruler   star  evening as  said ‘o my osseo i have had compassion  you given you back your youth  beauty into birds  various plumage changed your sisters  their husbands changed them thus because they mocked you in  figure   old man in  aspect sad  wrinkled could not see your heart  passion could not see your youth immortal only oweenee  faithful saw your naked heart  loved you “‘in  lodge  glimmers yonder in  little star  twinkles through  vapors   left hand lives  envious evil spirit the wabeno  magician who transformed you   old man take heed lest his beams fall  you for  rays  darts around him are  power  his enchantment are  arrows   uses’ “many years  peace  quiet on  peaceful star  evening dwelt osseo  his father many years  song  flutter at  doorway   wigwam hung  cage  rods  silver and fair oweenee  faithful bore  son unto osseo with  beauty  his mother with  courage  his father “and  boy grew up  prospered and osseo  delight him made him little bows  arrows opened  great cage  silver and let loose his aunts  uncles all those birds  glossy feathers for his little son  shoot at “round  round they wheeled  darted filled  evening star  music with their songs  joy  freedom filled  evening star  splendor with  fluttering  their plumage till  boy  little hunter bent his bow  shot  arrow shot  swift  fatal arrow and  bird  shining feathers at his feet fell wounded sorely “but o wondrous transformation ’t  no bird  saw before him ’t   beautiful young woman with  arrow  her bosom “when her blood fell   planet on  sacred star  evening broken   spell  magic powerless   strange enchantment and  youth  fearless bowman suddenly felt himself descending held  unseen hands but sinking downward through  empty spaces downward through  clouds  vapors till  rested   island on  island green  grassy yonder   bigseawater “after him  saw descending all  birds  shining feathers fluttering falling wafted downward like  painted leaves  autumn and  lodge  poles  silver with  roof like wings  beetles like  shining shards  beetles by  winds  heaven uplifted slowly sank upon  island bringing back  good osseo bringing oweenee  faithful “then  birds again transfigured reassumed  shape  mortals took their shape but not their stature they remained  little people like  pygmies  pukwudjies and  pleasant nights  summer when  evening star  shining hand  hand they danced together on  island’s craggy headlands on  sandbeach low  level “still their glittering lodge  seen there on  tranquil summer evenings and upon  shore  fisher sometimes hears their happy voices sees them dancing   starlight ” when  story  completed when  wondrous tale  ended looking round upon his listeners solemnly iagoo added “there  great men i have known such whom their people understand not whom they even make  jest of scoff  jeer   derision from  story  osseo let us learn  fate  jesters” all  wedding guests delighted listened   marvellous story listened laughing  applauding and they whispered  each other “does  mean himself i wonder and  we  aunts  uncles” then again sang chibiabos sang  song  love  longing in those accents sweet  tender in those tones  pensive sadness sang  maiden’s lamentation for her lover her algonquin “when i think  my beloved ah me think  my beloved when my heart  thinking  him o my sweetheart my

whispered ‘o my sweetheart my algonquin’ ‘far away away’ i answered ‘very far away’ i answered ‘ah me  my native country o my sweetheart my algonquin’ “when i looked back  behold him where we parted  behold him after me  still  gazing o my sweetheart my algonquin “by  tree  still  standing by  fallen tree  standing that had dropped into  water o my sweetheart my algonquin “when i think  my beloved

mondamin strip him  his plumes  tassels of his garments green  yellow” and  merry laughing water went rejoicing   wigwam with nokomis old  wrinkled and they called  women round them called  young men   maidens to  harvest   cornfields to  husking   maizeear on  border   forest underneath  fragrant pinetrees sat  old men   warriors smoking   pleasant shadow in uninterrupted silence looked they   gamesome labor of  young men   women listened  their noisy talking to their laughter  their singing heard them chattering like  magpies heard them laughing like  bluejays heard them singing like  robins and whene’er some lucky maiden found  red ear   husking found  maizeear red  blood is “nushka” cried they all together “nushka you shall have  sweetheart you shall have  handsome husband” “ugh”  old men all responded from their seats beneath  pinetrees and whene’er  youth or maiden found  crooked ear  husking found  maizeear   husking blighted mildewed or misshapen then they laughed  sang together crept  limped about  cornfields mimicked  their gait  gestures some old man bent almost double singing singly or together “wagemin  thief  cornfields paimosaid who steals  maizeear” till  cornfields rang  laughter till  hiawatha’s wigwam kahgahgee  king  ravens screamed  quivered  his anger and  all  neighboring treetops cawed  croaked  black marauders “ugh”  old men all responded from their seats beneath  pinetrees xiv picturewriting in those days said hiawatha “lo how all things fade  perish from  memory   old men pass away  great traditions the achievements   warriors the adventures   hunters all  wisdom   medas all  craft   wabenos all  marvellous dreams  visions of  jossakeeds  prophets “great men die   forgotten wise men speak their words  wisdom perish   ears  hear them do not reach  generations that  yet unborn  waiting in  great mysterious darkness of  speechless days  shall be “on  graveposts  our fathers are no signs no figures painted who   those graves we know not only know they  our fathers of what kith they   kindred from what old ancestral totem be  eagle bear or beaver they descended this we know not only know they  our fathers “face  face we speak together but we cannot speak when absent cannot send our voices  us to  friends  dwell afar off cannot send  secret message but  bearer learns our secret may pervert it may betray it may reveal  unto others” thus said hiawatha walking in  solitary forest pondering musing   forest on  welfare  his people from his pouch  took his colors took his paints  different colors on  smooth bark   birchtree painted many shapes  figures wonderful  mystic figures and each figure had  meaning each some word or thought suggested gitche manito  mighty he  master  life  painted as  egg  points projecting to  four winds   heavens everywhere   great spirit was  meaning  this symbol mitche manito  mighty he  dreadful spirit  evil as  serpent  depicted as kenabeek  great serpent very crafty very cunning is  creeping spirit  evil was  meaning  this symbol life  death  drew  circles life  white but death  darkened sun  moon  stars  painted man  beast  fish  reptile forests mountains lakes  rivers for  earth  drew  straight line for  sky  bow above it white  space between  daytime filled  little stars  nighttime on  left  point  sunrise on  right  point  sunset on  top  point  noontide and  rain  cloudy weather waving lines descending  it footprints pointing towards  wigwam were  sign  invitation were  sign  guests assembling bloody hands  palms uplifted were  symbol  destruction were  hostile sign  symbol all these things did hiawatha show unto his wondering people and interpreted their meaning and  said “behold your graveposts have no mark no sign nor symbol go  paint them all  figures each one   household symbol with  own ancestral totem so  those who follow after may distinguish them  know them” and they painted   graveposts on  graves yet unforgotten each his own ancestral totem each  symbol  his household figures   bear  reindeer of  turtle crane  beaver each inverted   token that  owner  departed that  chief who bore  symbol lay beneath  dust  ashes and  jossakeeds  prophets the wabenos  magicians and  medicinemen  medas painted upon bark  deerskin figures   songs they chanted for each song  separate symbol figures mystical  awful figures strange  brightly colored and each figure had  meaning each some magic song suggested the great spirit  creator flashing light through all  heaven the great serpent  kenabeek with his bloody crest erected creeping looking into heaven in  sky  sun  listens and  moon eclipsed  dying owl  eagle crane  henhawk and  cormorant bird  magic headless men  walk  heavens bodies lying pierced  arrows bloody hands  death uplifted flags  graves  great warcaptains grasping both  earth  heaven such  these  shapes they painted on  birchbark   deerskin songs  war  songs  hunting songs  medicine   magic all  written  these figures for each figure had  meaning each  separate song recorded nor forgotten   lovesong the most subtle  all medicines the most potent spell  magic dangerous more than war or hunting thus  lovesong  recorded symbol  interpretation first  human figure standing painted   brightest scarlet ’t   lover  musician and  meaning is “my painting makes me powerful over others” then  figure seated singing playing   drum  magic and  interpretation “listen ’t  my voice you hear my singing” then  same red figure seated in  shelter   wigwam and  meaning   symbol “i  come  sit beside you in  mystery  my passion” then two figures man  woman standing hand  hand together with their hands so clasped together that they seemed  one united and  words thus represented are “i see your heart within you and your cheeks  red  blushes” next  maiden   island in  centre   island and  song this shape suggested was “though you    distance were upon some faroff island such  spell i cast upon you such  magic power  passion i could straightway draw you  me” then  figure   maiden sleeping   lover near her whispering  her  her slumbers saying “though you  far  me in  land  sleep  silence still  voice  love would reach you” and  last  all  figures was  heart within  circle drawn within  magic circle and  image had this meaning “naked lies your heart before me to your naked heart i whisper” thus    hiawatha in his wisdom taught  people all  mysteries  painting all  art  picturewriting on  smooth bark   birchtree on  white skin   reindeer on  graveposts   village xv hiawatha’s lamentation in those days  evil spirits all  manitos  mischief fearing hiawatha’s wisdom and his love  chibiabos jealous  their faithful friendship and their noble words  actions made  length  league against them to molest them  destroy them hiawatha wise  wary often said  chibiabos “o my brother do not leave me lest  evil spirits harm you” chibiabos young  heedless laughing shook his coalblack tresses answered ever sweet  childlike “do not fear  me o brother harm  evil come not near me” once when peboan  winter roofed  ice  bigseawater when  snowflakes whirling downward hissed among  withered oakleaves changed  pinetrees into wigwams covered all  earth  silence armed  arrows shod  snowshoes heeding not his brother’s warning fearing not  evil spirits forth  hunt  deer  antlers all alone went chibiabos right across  bigseawater sprang  speed  deer before him with  wind  snow  followed o’er  treacherous ice  followed wild  all  fierce commotion and  rapture   hunting but beneath  evil spirits lay  ambush waiting  him broke  treacherous ice beneath him dragged him downward   bottom buried   sand his body unktahee  god  water he  god   dacotahs drowned him   deep abysses of  lake  gitche gumee from  headlands hiawatha sent forth such  wail  anguish such  fearful lamentation that  bison paused  listen and  wolves howled   prairies and  thunder   distance starting answered “baimwawa” then his face  black  painted with his robe his head  covered in his wigwam sat lamenting seven long weeks  sat lamenting uttering still this moan  sorrow “he  dead  sweet musician he  sweetest  all singers he  gone  us forever he  moved  little nearer to  master  all music to  master  all singing o my brother chibiabos” and  melancholy firtrees waved their dark green fans above him waved their purple cones above him sighing  him  console him mingling  his lamentation their complaining their lamenting came  spring  all  forest looked  vain  chibiabos sighed  rivulet sebowisha sighed  rushes   meadow from  treetops sang  bluebird sang  bluebird  owaissa “chibiabos chibiabos he  dead  sweet musician” from  wigwam sang  robin sang  robin  opechee “chibiabos chibiabos he  dead  sweetest singer” and  night through all  forest went  whippoorwill complaining wailing went  wawonaissa “chibiabos chibiabos he  dead  sweet musician he  sweetest  all singers” then  medicinemen  medas the magicians  wabenos and  jossakeeds  prophets came  visit hiawatha built  sacred lodge beside him to appease him  console him walked  silent grave procession bearing each  pouch  healing skin  beaver lynx or otter filled  magic roots  simples filled  very potent medicines when  heard their steps approaching hiawatha ceased lamenting called no more  chibiabos naught  questioned naught  answered but his mournful head uncovered from his face  mourning colors washed  slowly   silence slowly   silence followed onward   sacred wigwam there  magic drink they gave him made  nahmawusk  spearmint and wabenowusk  yarrow roots  power  herbs  healing beat their drums  shook their rattles chanted singly   chorus mystic songs like these they chanted “i myself myself behold me ’t   great gray eagle talking come ye white crows come  hear him the loudspeaking thunder helps me all  unseen spirits help me i can hear their voices calling all around  sky i hear them i can blow you strong my brother i can heal you hiawatha” “hiauha” replied  chorus “wayhaway”  mystic chorus friends  mine  all  serpents hear me shake my skin  henhawk mahng  white loon i can kill him i can shoot your heart  kill it i can blow you strong my brother i can heal you hiawatha ” “hiauha” replied  chorus “wayhaway”  mystic chorus “i myself myself  prophet when i speak  wigwam trembles shakes  sacred lodge  terror hands unseen begin  shake it when i walk  sky i tread  bends  makes  noise beneath me i can blow you strong my brother rise  speak o hiawatha” “hiauha” replied  chorus “wayhaway”  mystic chorus then they shook their medicinepouches o’er  head  hiawatha danced their medicinedance around him and upstarting wild  haggard like  man  dreams awakened he  healed  all his madness as  clouds  swept  heaven straightway  his brain departed all his moody melancholy as  ice  swept  rivers straightway  his heart departed all his sorrow  affliction then they summoned chibiabos from his grave beneath  waters from  sands  gitche gumee summoned hiawatha’s brother and so mighty   magic of  cry  invocation that  heard    lay there underneath  bigseawater from  sand  rose  listened heard  music   singing came obedient   summons to  doorway   wigwam but  enter they forbade him through  chink  coal they gave him through  door  burning firebrand ruler   land  spirits ruler o’er  dead they made him telling him  fire  kindle for all those  died thereafter campfires  their night encampments on their solitary journey to  kingdom  ponemah to  land   hereafter from  village  his childhood from  homes  those who knew him passing silent through  forest like  smokewreath wafted sideways slowly vanished chibiabos where  passed  branches moved not where  trod  grasses bent not and  fallen leaves  last year made no sound beneath his footstep four whole days  journeyed onward down  pathway   dead men on  deadman’s strawberry feasted crossed  melancholy river on  swinging log  crossed it came unto  lake  silver in  stone canoe  carried to  islands   blessed to  land  ghosts  shadows on  journey moving slowly many weary spirits saw he panting under heavy burdens laden  warclubs bows  arrows robes  fur  pots  kettles and  food  friends had given for  solitary journey “ay why do  living” said they “lay such heavy burdens  us better    go naked better    go fasting than  bear such heavy burdens on our long  weary journey” forth then issued hiawatha wandered eastward wandered westward teaching men  use  simples and  antidotes  poisons and  cure  all diseases thus  first made known  mortals all  mystery  medamin all  sacred art  healing xvi paupukkeewis you shall hear how paupukkeewis he  handsome yenadizze whom  people called  stormfool vexed  village  disturbance you shall hear

twice  leaped  lo above him cracked  sky  ice  rivers when  freshet   highest thrice  leaped  lo above him broke  shattered sky asunder and  disappeared within it and ojeeg  fisher weasel with  bound went  behind him” “hark you” shouted paupukkeewis as  entered   doorway “i am tired  all this talking tired  old iagoo’s stories tired  hiawatha’s wisdom here  something  amuse you better than this endless talking” then  out his pouch  wolfskin forth  drew  solemn manner all  game  bowl  counters pugasaing  thirteen pieces white  one side  they painted and vermilion   other two kenabeeks or great serpents two ininewug or wedgemen one great warclub pugamaugun and one slender fish  keego four round pieces ozawabeeks and three sheshebwug or ducklings all  made  bone  painted all except

seen  different nations have i played  different countries he who plays  old iagoo must have very nimble fingers though you think yourself so skilful i can beat you paupukkeewis i can even give you lessons in your game  bowl  counters” so they sat  played together all  old men   young men played  dresses weapons wampum played till midnight played till morning played until  yenadizze till  cunning paupukkeewis of their treasures had despoiled them of  best  all their dresses shirts  deerskin robes  ermine belts  wampum crests  feathers warlike weapons pipes  pouches twenty eyes glared wildly  him like  eyes  wolves glared  him said  lucky paupukkeewis “in my wigwam i am lonely in my wanderings  adventures i have need   companion fain would have  meshinauwa an attendant  pipebearer

iagoo faceinamist  people called him as  fire burns   pipehead dusky red beneath  ashes so beneath his shaggy eyebrows glowed  eyes  old iagoo “ugh”  answered very fiercely “ugh” they answered all  each one seized  wooden bowl  old man closely  his bony fingers clutched  fatal bowl onagon shook  fiercely   fury made  pieces ring together as  threw them down before him red  both  great kenabeeks red  ininewug  wedgemen red  sheshebwug  ducklings black  four brass ozawabeeks white alone  fish  keego only five  pieces counted then  smiling paupukkeewis shook  bowl  threw  pieces lightly   air

saying “five tens mine  game is” twenty eyes glared  him fiercely like  eyes  wolves glared  him as  turned  left  wigwam followed  his meshinauwa by  nephew  iagoo by  tall  graceful stripling bearing  his arms  winnings shirts  deerskin robes  ermine belts  wampum pipes  weapons “carry them” said paupukkeewis pointing  his fan  feathers “to my wigwam far  eastward on  dunes  nagow wudjoo” hot  red  smoke  gambling were  eyes  paupukkeewis as  came forth   freshness of  pleasant summer morning all  birds  singing gayly all  streamlets flowing swiftly and  heart  paupukkeewis sang  pleasure   birds sing beat  triumph like  streamlets as  wandered through  village in  early gray  morning with his fan  turkeyfeathers with his plumes  tufts  swan’s down till  reached  farthest wigwam reached  lodge  hiawatha silent    deserted no one met him   doorway no one came  bid him welcome but  birds  singing round it in  out  round  doorway hopping singing fluttering feeding and aloft upon  ridgepole kahgahgee  king  ravens sat  fiery eyes and screaming flapped his wings  paupukkeewis “all  gone  lodge  empty” thus   spake paupukkeewis in his heart resolving mischief “gone  wary hiawatha gone  silly laughing water gone nokomis  old woman and  lodge  left unguarded” by  neck  seized  raven whirled  round him like  rattle like  medicinepouch  shook it strangled kahgahgee  raven from  ridgepole   wigwam left  lifeless body hanging as  insult   master as  taunt  hiawatha with  stealthy step  entered round  lodge  wild disorder threw  household things about him piled together  confusion bowls  wood  earthen kettles robes  buffalo  beaver skins  otter lynx  ermine as  insult  nokomis as  taunt  minnehaha then departed paupukkeewis whistling singing through  forest whistling gayly   squirrels who  hollow boughs above him dropped their acornshells upon him singing gayly   wood birds who  out  leafy darkness answered   song  merry then  climbed  rocky headlands looking o’er  gitche gumee perched himself upon their summit waiting full  mirth  mischief the return  hiawatha stretched upon his back  lay there far below him splashed  waters plashed  washed  dreamy waters far above him swam  heavens swam  dizzy dreamy heavens round him hovered fluttered rustled hiawatha’s mountain chickens flockwise swept  wheeled about him almost brushed him  their pinions and  killed them   lay there slaughtered them  tens  twenties threw their bodies down  headland threw them   beach below him till  length kayoshk  seagull perched upon  crag above them shouted “it  paupukkeewis he  slaying us  hundreds send  message  our brother tidings send  hiawatha” xvii the hunting  paupukkeewis full  wrath  hiawatha when  came into  village found  people  confusion heard  all  misdemeanors all  malice   mischief of  cunning paupukkeewis hard his breath came through his nostrils through his teeth  buzzed  muttered words  anger  resentment hot  humming like  hornet “i  slay this paupukkeewis slay this mischiefmaker” said he “not so long  wide  world is not so rude  rough  way is that my wrath shall not attain him that my vengeance shall not reach him” then  swift pursuit departed hiawatha   hunters on  trail  paupukkeewis through  forest where  passed it to  headlands where  rested but they found not paupukkeewis only   trampled grasses in  whortleberrybushes found  couch where  had rested found  impress  his body from  lowlands far beneath them from  muskoday  meadow paupukkeewis turning backward made  gesture  defiance made  gesture  derision and aloud cried hiawatha from  summit   mountains “not so long  wide  world is not so rude  rough  way is but my wrath shall overtake you and my vengeance shall attain you” over rock  over river through bush  brake  forest ran  cunning paupukkeewis like  antelope  bounded till  came unto  streamlet in  middle   forest to  streamlet still  tranquil that had overflowed  margin to  dam made   beavers to  pond  quiet water where kneedeep  trees  standing where  water lilies floated where  rushes waved  whispered on  dam stood paupukkeewis on  dam  trunks  branches through whose chinks  water spouted o’er whose summit flowed  streamlet from  bottom rose  beaver looked  two great eyes  wonder eyes  seemed  ask  question at  stranger paupukkeewis on  dam stood paupukkeewis o’er his ankles flowed  streamlet flowed  bright  silvery water and  spake unto  beaver with  smile  spake  this wise “o my friend ahmeek  beaver cool  pleasant   water let me dive into  water let me rest there  your lodges change me too into  beaver” cautiously replied  beaver with reserve  thus made answer “let me first consult  others let me ask  other beavers” down  sank into  water heavily sank he   stone sinks down among  leaves  branches brown  matted   bottom on  dam stood paupukkeewis o’er his ankles flowed  streamlet spouted through  chinks below him dashed upon  stones beneath him spread serene  calm before him and  sunshine   shadows fell  flecks  gleams upon him fell  little shining patches through  waving rustling branches from  bottom rose  beavers silently above  surface rose one head  then another till  pond seemed full  beavers full  black  shining faces to  beavers paupukkeewis spake entreating said  this wise “very pleasant  your dwelling o my friends  safe  danger can you not  all your cunning all your wisdom  contrivance change me too into  beaver” “yes” replied ahmeek  beaver he  king  all  beavers “let yourself slide down among us down into  tranquil water” down into  pond among them silently sank paupukkeewis black became his shirt  deerskin black his moccasins  leggings in  broad black tail behind him spread his foxtails  his fringes he  changed into  beaver “make me large” said paupukkeewis “make me large  make me larger larger than  other beavers” “yes”  beaver chief responded “when our lodge below you enter in our wigwam we  make you ten times larger than  others” thus into  clear brown water silently sank paupukkeewis found  bottom covered over with  trunks  trees  branches hoards  food against  winter piles  heaps against  famine found  lodge  arching doorway leading into spacious chambers here they made him large  larger made him largest   beavers ten times larger than  others “you shall  our ruler” said they “chief  king  all  beavers” but not long had paupukkeewis sat  state among  beavers when there came  voice  warning from  watchman  his station in  waterflags  lilies saying “here  hiawatha hiawatha  his hunters” then they heard  cry above them heard  shouting   tramping heard  crashing   rushing and  water round  o’er them sank  sucked away  eddies and they knew their dam  broken on  lodge’s roof  hunters leaped  broke  all asunder streamed  sunshine through  crevice sprang  beavers through  doorway hid themselves  deeper water in  channel   streamlet but  mighty paupukkeewis could not pass beneath  doorway he  puffed  pride  feeding he  swollen like  bladder through  roof looked hiawatha cried aloud “o paupukkeewis vain  all your craft  cunning vain your manifold disguises well i know you paupukkeewis” with their clubs they beat  bruised him beat  death poor paupukkeewis pounded him  maize  pounded till his skull  crushed  pieces six tall hunters lithe  limber bore him home  poles  branches bore  body   beaver but  ghost  jeebi  him thought  felt  paupukkeewis still lived   paupukkeewis and  fluttered strove  struggled waving hither waving thither as  curtains   wigwam struggle  their thongs  deerskin when  wintry wind  blowing till  drew itself together till  rose up   body till  took  form  features of  cunning paupukkeewis vanishing into  forest but  wary hiawatha saw  figure ere  vanished saw  form  paupukkeewis glide into  soft blue shadow of  pinetrees   forest toward  squares  white beyond it toward  opening   forest like  wind  rushed  panted bending all  boughs before it and behind it   rain comes came  steps  hiawatha to  lake  many islands came  breathless paupukkeewis where among  waterlilies pishnekuh  brant  sailing through  tufts  rushes floating steering through  reedy islands now their broad black beaks they lifted now they plunged beneath  water now they darkened   shadow now they brightened   sunshine “pishnekuh” cried paupukkeewis “pishnekuh my brothers” said he “change me   brant  plumage with  shining neck  feathers make me large  make me larger ten times larger than  others” straightway   brant they changed him with two huge  dusky pinions with  bosom smooth  rounded with  bill like two great paddles made him larger than  others ten times larger than  largest just as shouting   forest on  shore stood hiawatha up they rose  cry  clamor with  whir  beat  pinions rose up   reedy islands from  waterflags  lilies and they said  paupukkeewis “in your flying look not downward take good heed  look not downward lest some strange mischance should happen lest some great mishap befall you” fast  far they fled  northward fast  far through mist  sunshine fed among  moors  fenlands slept among  reeds  rushes on  morrow  they journeyed buoyed  lifted   southwind wafted onward   southwind blowing fresh  strong behind them rose  sound  human voices rose  clamor  beneath them from  lodges   village from  people miles beneath them for  people   village saw  flock  brant  wonder saw  wings  paupukkeewis flapping far up   ether broader than two doorway curtains paupukkeewis heard  shouting knew  voice  hiawatha knew  outcry  iagoo and forgetful   warning drew his neck in  looked downward and  wind  blew behind him caught his mighty fan  feathers sent him wheeling whirling downward all  vain did paupukkeewis struggle  regain his balance whirling round  round  downward he beheld  turn  village and  turn  flock above him saw  village coming nearer and  flock receding farther heard  voices growing louder heard  shouting   laughter saw no more  flocks above him only saw  earth beneath him dead out   empty heaven dead among  shouting people with  heavy sound  sullen fell  brant  broken pinions but his soul his ghost his shadow still survived  paupukkeewis took again  form  features of  handsome yenadizze and again went rushing onward followed fast  hiawatha crying “not so wide  world is not so long  rough  way is but my wrath shall overtake you but my vengeance shall attain you” and so near  came so near him that his hand  stretched  seize him his right hand  seize  hold him when  cunning paupukkeewis whirled  spun about  circles fanned  air into  whirlwind danced  dust  leaves about him and amid  whirling eddies sprang into  hollow oaktree changed himself into  serpent gliding out through root  rubbish with his right hand hiawatha smote amain  hollow oaktree rent  into shreds  splinters left  lying there  fragments but  vain  paupukkeewis once again  human figure full  sight ran  before him sped away  gust  whirlwind on  shores  gitche gumee westward   bigseawater came unto  rocky headlands to  pictured rocks  sandstone looking over lake  landscape and  old man   mountain he  manito  mountains opened wide his rocky doorways opened wide his deep abysses giving paupukkeewis shelter in his caverns dark  dreary bidding paupukkeewis welcome to his gloomy lodge  sandstone there without stood hiawatha found  doorways closed against him with his mittens minjekahwun smote great caverns   sandstone cried aloud  tones  thunder “open i am hiawatha” but  old man   mountain opened not  made no answer from  silent crags  sandstone from  gloomy rock abysses then  raised his hands  heaven called imploring   tempest called waywassimo  lightning and  thunder annemeekee and they came  night  darkness sweeping down  bigseawater from  distant thunder mountains and  trembling paupukkeewis heard  footsteps   thunder saw  red eyes   lightning was afraid  crouched  trembled then waywassimo  lightning smote  doorways   caverns with his warclub smote  doorways smote  jutting crags  sandstone and  thunder annemeekee shouted down into  caverns saying “where  paupukkeewis” and  crags fell  beneath them dead among  rocky ruins lay  cunning paupukkeewis lay  handsome yenadizze slain  his own human figure ended  his wild adventures ended  his tricks  gambols ended all his craft  cunning ended all his mischiefmaking all his gambling  his dancing all his wooing   maidens then  noble hiawatha took his soul his ghost his shadow spake  said “o paupukkeewis never more  human figure shall

glistened   sunshine insects skated   water filled  drowsy air  buzzing with  far resounding warcry down  river came  strong man in his birch canoe came kwasind floating slowly down  current of  sluggish taquamenaw very languid   weather very sleepy   silence from  overhanging branches from  tassels   birchtrees soft  spirit  sleep descended by his airy hosts surrounded his invisible attendants came  spirit  sleep nepahwin like  burnished dushkwoneshe like  dragonfly  hovered o’er  drowsy head  kwasind to his ear there came  murmur as  waves upon  seashore as  faroff tumbling waters as  winds among  pinetrees and  felt upon his forehead blows  little airy warclubs wielded   slumbrous legions of  spirit  sleep nepahwin as  some one breathing  him at  first blow  their warclubs fell  drowsiness  kwasind at  second blow they smote him motionless his paddle rested at  third before his vision reeled  landscape into darkness very sound asleep  kwasind so  floated down  river like  blind man seated upright floated down  taquamenaw underneath  trembling birchtrees underneath  wooded headlands underneath  war encampment of  pygmies  pukwudjies there they stood all armed  waiting hurled  pinecones down upon him struck him  his brawny shoulders on his crown defenceless struck him “death  kwasind”   sudden warcry   little people and  sideways swayed  tumbled sideways fell into  river plunged beneath  sluggish water headlong   otter plunges and  birch canoe abandoned drifted empty down  river bottom upward swerved  drifted nothing more  seen  kwasind but  memory   strong man lingered long among  people and whenever through  forest raged  roared  wintry tempest and  branches tossed  troubled creaked  groaned  split asunder “kwasind” cried they “that  kwasind he  gathering  his firewood” xix the ghosts never stoops  soaring vulture on his quarry   desert on  sick or wounded bison but another vulture watching from his high aerial lookout sees  downward plunge  follows and  third pursues  second coming   invisible ether first  speck  then  vulture till  air  dark  pinions so disasters come not singly but  if they watched  waited scanning one another’s motions when  first descends  others follow follow gathering flockwise round their victim sick  wounded first  shadow then  sorrow till  air  dark  anguish now o’er all  dreary northland mighty peboan  winter breathing   lakes  rivers into stone had changed their waters from his hair  shook  snowflakes till  plains  strewn  whiteness one uninterrupted level as if stooping  creator with his hand had smoothed them over through  forest wide  wailing roamed  hunter  his snowshoes in  village worked  women pounded maize or dressed  deerskin and  young men played together on  ice  noisy ballplay on  plain  dance  snowshoes one dark evening after sundown in her wigwam laughing water sat  old nokomis waiting for  steps  hiawatha homeward   hunt returning on their faces gleamed  firelight painting them  streaks  crimson in  eyes  old nokomis glimmered like  watery moonlight in  eyes  laughing water glistened like  sun  water and behind them crouched their shadows in  corners   wigwam and  smoke  wreaths above them climbed  crowded through  smokeflue then  curtain   doorway from without  slowly lifted brighter glowed  fire  moment and  moment swerved  smokewreath as two women entered softly passed  doorway uninvited without word  salutation without sign  recognition sat down   farthest corner crouching low among  shadows from their aspect  their garments strangers seemed they   village very pale  haggard  they as they sat there sad  silent trembling cowering   shadows was   wind above  smokeflue muttering down into  wigwam was   owl  kokokoho hooting   dismal forest sure  voice said   silence “these  corpses clad  garments these  ghosts  come  haunt you from  kingdom  ponemah from  land   hereafter” homeward now came hiawatha from his hunting   forest with  snow upon his tresses and  red deer  his shoulders at  feet  laughing water down  threw his lifeless burden nobler handsomer she thought him than when first  came  woo her first threw down  deer before her as  token  his wishes as  promise   future then  turned  saw  strangers cowering crouching   shadows said within himself “who  they what strange guests  minnehaha” but  questioned not  strangers only spake  bid them welcome to his lodge his food his fireside when  evening meal  ready and  deer had been divided both  pallid guests  strangers springing  among  shadows seized upon  choicest portions seized  white fat   roebuck set apart  laughing water for  wife  hiawatha without asking without thanking eagerly devoured  morsels flitted back among  shadows in  corner   wigwam not  word spake hiawatha not  motion made nokomis not  gesture laughing water not  change came o’er their features only minnehaha softly whispered saying “they  famished let them do what best delights them let them eat  they  famished” many  daylight dawned  darkened many  night shook off  daylight as  pine shakes off  snowflakes from  midnight   branches day  day  guests unmoving sat there silent   wigwam but  night  storm or starlight forth they went into  forest bringing firewood   wigwam bringing pinecones   burning always sad  always silent and whenever hiawatha came  fishing or  hunting when  evening meal  ready and  food had been divided gliding  their darksome corner came  pallid guests  strangers seized upon  choicest portions set aside  laughing water and without rebuke or question flitted back among  shadows never once had hiawatha by  word or look reproved them never once had old nokomis made  gesture  impatience never once had laughing water shown resentment   outrage all had they endured  silence that  rights  guest  stranger that  virtue  freegiving by  look might not  lessened by  word might not  broken once  midnight hiawatha ever wakeful ever watchful in  wigwam dimly lighted by  brands  still  burning by  glimmering flickering firelight heard  sighing oft repeated from his couch rose hiawatha from his shaggy hides  bison pushed aside  deerskin curtain saw  pallid guests  shadows sitting upright  their couches weeping   silent midnight and  said “o guests why   that your hearts  so afflicted that you sob so   midnight has perchance  old nokomis has my wife my minnehaha wronged or grieved you  unkindness failed  hospitable duties” then  shadows ceased  weeping ceased  sobbing  lamenting and they said  gentle voices “we  ghosts   departed souls  those who once   you from  realms  chibiabos hither have we come  try you hither have we come  warn you “cries  grief  lamentation reach us   blessed islands cries  anguish   living calling back their friends departed sadden us  useless sorrow therefore have we come  try you no one knows us no one heeds us we  but  burden  you and we see   departed have no place among  living “think  this o hiawatha speak    all  people that henceforward  forever they no more  lamentations sadden  souls   departed in  islands   blessed “do not lay such heavy burdens in  graves  those you bury not such weight  furs  wampum not such weight  pots  kettles for  spirits faint beneath them only give them food  carry only give them fire  light them “four days   spirit’s journey to  land  ghosts  shadows four  lonely night encampments four times must their fires  lighted therefore when  dead  buried let  fire  night approaches four times   grave  kindled that  soul upon  journey may not lack  cheerful firelight may not grope about  darkness “farewell noble hiawatha we have put you   trial to  proof have put your patience by  insult  our presence by  outrage  our actions we have found you great  noble fail not   greater trial faint not   harder struggle” when they ceased  sudden darkness fell  filled  silent wigwam hiawatha heard  rustle as  garments trailing  him heard  curtain   doorway lifted   hand  saw not felt  cold breath   night air for  moment saw  starlight but  saw  ghosts no longer saw no more  wandering spirits from  kingdom  ponemah from  land   hereafter xx the famine oh  long  dreary winter oh  cold  cruel winter ever thicker thicker thicker froze  ice  lake  river ever deeper deeper deeper fell  snow o’er all  landscape fell  covering snow  drifted through  forest round  village hardly  his buried wigwam could  hunter force  passage with his mittens  his snowshoes vainly walked  through  forest sought  bird or beast  found none saw no track  deer or rabbit in  snow beheld no footprints in  ghastly gleaming forest fell  could not rise  weakness perished there  cold  hunger oh  famine   fever oh  wasting   famine oh  blasting   fever oh  wailing   children oh  anguish   women all  earth  sick  famished hungry   air around them hungry   sky above them and  hungry stars  heaven like  eyes  wolves glared  them into hiawatha’s wigwam came two other guests  silent as  ghosts were   gloomy waited not   invited did not parley   doorway sat there without word  welcome in  seat  laughing water looked  haggard eyes  hollow at  face  laughing water and  foremost said “behold me i am famine bukadawin” and  other said “behold me i am fever ahkosewin” and  lovely minnehaha shuddered  they looked upon her shuddered   words they uttered lay down  her bed  silence hid her face but made no answer lay there trembling freezing burning at  looks they cast upon her at  fearful words they uttered forth into  empty forest rushed  maddened hiawatha in his heart  deadly sorrow in his face  stony firmness on his brow  sweat  anguish started but  froze  fell not wrapped  furs  armed  hunting with his mighty bow  ashtree with his quiver full  arrows with his mittens minjekahwun into  vast  vacant forest on his snowshoes strode  forward “gitche manito  mighty” cried   his face uplifted in  bitter hour  anguish “give your children food o father give us food or we must perish give me food  minnehaha for my dying minnehaha” through  farresounding forest through  forest vast  vacant rang  cry  desolation but there came no other answer than  echo  his crying than  echo   woodlands “minnehaha minnehaha” all day long roved hiawatha in  melancholy forest through  shadow  whose thickets in  pleasant days  summer of  ne’er forgotten summer he had brought his young wife homeward from  land   dacotahs when  birds sang   thickets and  streamlets laughed  glistened and  air  full  fragrance and  lovely laughing water said  voice  did not tremble “i  follow you my husband” in  wigwam  nokomis with those gloomy guests  watched her with  famine   fever she  lying  beloved she  dying minnehaha “hark” she said “i hear  rushing hear  roaring   rushing hear  falls  minnehaha calling  me   distance” “no my child” said old nokomis “’t   nightwind   pinetrees” “look” she said “i see my father standing lonely  his doorway beckoning  me  his wigwam in  land   dacotahs” “no my child” said old nokomis “’t   smoke  waves  beckons” “ah” said she “the eyes  pauguk glare upon me   darkness i can feel his icy fingers clasping mine amid  darkness hiawatha hiawatha” and  desolate hiawatha far away amid  forest miles away among  mountains heard  sudden cry  anguish heard  voice  minnehaha calling  him   darkness “hiawatha hiawatha” over snowfields waste  pathless under snowencumbered branches homeward hurried hiawatha emptyhanded heavyhearted heard nokomis moaning wailing “wahonowin wahonowin would  i had perished  you would  i  dead  you are wahonowin wahonowin” and  rushed into  wigwam saw  old nokomis slowly rocking   fro  moaning saw his lovely minnehaha lying dead  cold before him and his bursting heart within him uttered such  cry  anguish that  forest moaned  shuddered that  very stars  heaven shook  trembled  his anguish then  sat down still  speechless on  bed  minnehaha at  feet  laughing water at those willing feet  never more would lightly run  meet him never more would lightly follow with both hands his face  covered seven long days  nights  sat there as if   swoon  sat there speechless motionless unconscious of  daylight or  darkness then they buried minnehaha in  snow  grave they made her in  forest deep  darksome underneath  moaning hemlocks clothed her  her richest garments wrapped her  her robes  ermine covered her  snow like ermine thus they buried minnehaha and  night  fire  lighted on her grave four times  kindled for her soul upon  journey to  islands   blessed from his doorway hiawatha saw  burning   forest lighting up  gloomy hemlocks from his sleepless bed uprising from  bed  minnehaha stood  watched    doorway that  might not  extinguished might not leave her   darkness “farewell” said he “minnehaha farewell o my laughing water all my heart  buried  you all my thoughts go onward  you come not back again  labor come not back again  suffer where  famine   fever wear  heart  waste  body soon my task   completed soon your footsteps i shall follow to  islands   blessed to  kingdom  ponemah to  land   hereafter” xxi the white man’s foot in his lodge beside  river close beside  frozen river sat  old man sad  lonely white his hair    snowdrift dull  low his fire  burning and  old man shook  trembled folded  his waubewyon in his tattered whiteskinwrapper hearing nothing but  tempest as  roared along  forest seeing nothing but  snowstorm as  whirled  hissed  drifted all  coals  white  ashes and  fire  slowly dying as  young man walking lightly at  open doorway entered red  blood  youth his cheeks were soft his eyes  stars  springtime bound his forehead   grasses bound  plumed  scented grasses on his lips  smile  beauty filling all  lodge  sunshine in his hand  bunch  blossoms filling all  lodge  sweetness “ah my son” exclaimed  old man “happy  my eyes  see you sit here   mat beside me sit here   dying embers let us pass  night together tell me  your strange adventures of  lands where you have travelled i  tell you  my prowess of my many deeds  wonder” from his pouch  drew his peacepipe very old  strangely fashioned made  red stone   pipehead and  stem  reed  feathers filled  pipe  bark  willow placed  burning coal upon it gave   his guest  stranger and began  speak  this wise “when i blow my breath about me when i breathe upon  landscape motionless  all  rivers hard  stone becomes  water” and  young man answered smiling “when i blow my breath about me when i breathe upon  landscape flowers spring up o’er all  meadows singing onward rush  rivers” “when i shake my hoary tresses” said  old man darkly frowning “all  land  snow  covered all  leaves  all  branches fall  fade  die  wither for i breathe  lo they  not from  waters   marshes rise  wild goose   heron fly away  distant regions for i speak  lo they  not and where’er my footsteps wander all  wild beasts   forest hide themselves  holes  caverns and  earth becomes  flintstone” “when i shake my flowing ringlets” said  young man softly laughing “showers  rain fall warm  welcome plants lift up their heads rejoicing back unto their lakes  marshes come  wild goose   heron homeward shoots  arrowy swallow sing  bluebird   robin and where’er my footsteps wander all  meadows wave  blossoms all  woodlands ring  music all  trees  dark  foliage” while they spake  night departed from  distant realms  wabun from his shining lodge  silver like  warrior robed  painted came  sun  said “behold me gheezis  great sun behold me” then  old man’s tongue  speechless and  air grew warm  pleasant and upon  wigwam sweetly sang  bluebird   robin and  stream began  murmur and  scent  growing grasses through  lodge  gently wafted and segwun  youthful stranger more distinctly   daylight saw  icy face before him it  peboan  winter from his eyes  tears  flowing as  melting lakes  streamlets and his body shrunk  dwindled as  shouting sun ascended till into  air  faded till into  ground  vanished and  young man saw before him on  hearthstone   wigwam where  fire had smoked  smouldered saw  earliest flower  springtime saw  beauty   springtime saw  miskodeed  blossom thus      northland after  unheardof coldness that intolerable winter came  spring  all  splendor all  birds  all  blossoms all  flowers  leaves  grasses sailing   wind  northward flying  great flocks like arrows like huge arrows shot through heaven passed  swan  mahnahbezee speaking almost   man speaks and  long lines waving bending like  bowstring snapped asunder came  white goose wawbewawa and  pairs or singly flying mahng  loon  clangorous pinions the blue heron  shuhshuhgah and  grouse  mushkodasa in  thickets   meadows piped  bluebird  owaissa on  summit   lodges sang  robin  opechee in  covert   pinetrees cooed  pigeon  omemee and  sorrowing hiawatha speechless  his infinite sorrow heard their voices calling  him went forth  his gloomy doorway stood  gazed into  heaven gazed upon  earth  waters from his wanderings far  eastward from  regions   morning from  shining land  wabun homeward now returned iagoo the great traveller  great boaster full  new  strange adventures marvels many  many wonders and  people   village listened  him   told them of his marvellous adventures laughing answered him  this wise “ugh   indeed iagoo no one else beholds such wonders” he had seen  said  water bigger than  bigseawater broader than  gitche gumee bitter so  none could drink it at each other looked  warriors looked  women  each other smiled  said “it cannot  so” kaw” they said “it cannot  so” o’er it said he o’er this water came  great canoe  pinions a canoe  wings came flying bigger than  grove  pinetrees taller than  tallest treetops and  old men   women looked  tittered  each other “kaw” they said “we don’t believe it” from  mouth  said  greet him came waywassimo  lightning came  thunder annemeekee and  warriors   women laughed aloud  poor iagoo “kaw” they said “what tales you tell us” in it said he came  people in  great canoe  pinions came  said  hundred warriors painted white  all their faces and  hair their chins  covered and  warriors   women laughed  shouted  derision like  ravens   treetops like  crows upon  hemlocks “kaw” they said “what lies you tell us do not think  we believe them” only hiawatha laughed not but  gravely spake  answered to their jeering  their jesting “true  all iagoo tells us i have seen    vision seen  great canoe  pinions seen  people  white faces seen  coming  this bearded people   wooden vessel from  regions   morning from  shining land  wabun “gitche manito  mighty the great spirit  creator sends them hither  his errand sends them  us  his message wheresoe’er they move before them swarms  stinging fly  ahmo swarms  bee  honeymaker wheresoe’er they tread beneath them springs  flower unknown among us springs  whiteman’s foot  blossom “let us welcome then  strangers hail them  our friends  brothers and  heart’s right hand  friendship give them when they come  see us gitche manito  mighty said this  me  my vision “i beheld too   vision all  secrets   future of  distant days  shall be i beheld  westward marches of  unknown crowded nations all  land  full  people restless struggling toiling striving speaking many tongues yet feeling but one heartbeat  their bosoms in  woodlands rang their axes smoked their towns  all  valleys over all  lakes  rivers rushed their great canoes  thunder “then  darker drearier vision passed before me vague  cloudlike i beheld our nation scattered all forgetful  my counsels weakened warring  each other saw  remnants  our people sweeping westward wild  woful like  cloudrack   tempest like  withered leaves  autumn” xxii hiawatha’s departure by  shore  gitche gumee by  shining bigseawater at  doorway  his wigwam in  pleasant summer morning hiawatha stood  waited all  air  full  freshness all  earth  bright  joyous and before him through  sunshine westward toward  neighboring forest passed  golden swarms  ahmo passed  bees  honeymakers burning singing   sunshine bright above him shone  heavens level spread  lake before him from  bosom leaped  sturgeon sparkling flashing   sunshine on  margin  great forest stood reflected   water every treetop had  shadow motionless beneath  water from  brow  hiawatha gone  every trace  sorrow as  fog  off  water as  mist  off  meadow with  smile  joy  triumph with  look  exultation as  one who   vision sees what   be but  not stood  waited hiawatha toward  sun his hands  lifted both  palms spread out against it and between  parted fingers fell  sunshine  his features flecked  light his naked shoulders as  falls  flecks  oaktree through  rifted leaves  branches o’er  water floating flying something   hazy distance something   mists  morning loomed  lifted   water now seemed floating now seemed flying coming nearer nearer nearer was  shingebis  diver or  pelican  shada or  heron  shuhshuhgah or  white goose wawbewawa with  water dripping flashing from  glossy neck  feathers it  neither goose nor diver neither pelican nor heron o’er  water floating flying through  shining mist  morning but  birch canoe  paddles rising sinking   water dripping flashing   sunshine and within  came  people from  distant land  wabun from  farthest realms  morning came  blackrobe chief  prophet he  priest  prayer  paleface with his guides  his companions and  noble hiawatha with his hands aloft extended held aloft  sign  welcome waited full  exultation till  birch canoe  paddles grated   shining pebbles stranded   sandy margin till  blackrobe chief  paleface with  cross upon his bosom landed   sandy margin then  joyous hiawatha cried aloud  spake  this wise “beautiful   sun o strangers when you come so far  see us all our town  peace awaits you all our doors stand open  you you shall enter all our wigwams for  heart’s right hand we give you “never bloomed  earth so gayly never shone  sun so brightly as today they shine  blossom when you come so far  see us never  our lake so tranquil nor so free  rocks  sandbars for your birch canoe  passing has removed both rock  sandbar “never before had our tobacco such  sweet  pleasant flavor never  broad leaves  our cornfields were so beautiful  look on as they seem  us this morning when you come so far  see us’ and  blackrobe chief made answer stammered  his speech  little speaking words yet unfamiliar “peace   you hiawatha peace   you  your people peace  prayer  peace  pardon peace  christ  joy  mary” then  generous hiawatha led  strangers  his wigwam seated them  skins  bison seated them  skins  ermine and  careful old nokomis brought them food  bowls  basswood water brought  birchen dippers and  calumet  peacepipe filled  lighted  their smoking all  old men   village all  warriors   nation all  jossakeeds  prophets the magicians  wabenos and  medicinemen  medas came  bid  strangers welcome “it  well” they said “o brothers that you come so far  see us” in  circle round  doorway with their pipes they sat  silence waiting  behold  strangers waiting  receive their message till  blackrobe chief  paleface from  wigwam came  greet them stammering  his speech  little speaking words yet unfamiliar “it  well” they said “o brother that you come so far  see us” then  blackrobe chief  prophet told his message   people told  purport  his mission told them   virgin mary and her blessed son  saviour how  distant lands  ages he had lived  earth  we do how  fasted prayed  labored how  jews  tribe accursed mocked him scourged him crucified him how  rose  where they laid him walked again  his disciples and ascended into heaven and  chiefs made answer saying “we have listened  your message we have heard your words  wisdom we  think  what you tell us it  well  us o brothers that you come so far  see us” then they rose up  departed each one homeward  his wigwam to  young men   women told  story   strangers whom  master  life had sent them from  shining land  wabun heavy   heat  silence grew  afternoon  summer with  drowsy sound  forest whispered round  sultry wigwam with  sound  sleep  water rippled   beach below it from  cornfields shrill  ceaseless sang  grasshopper pahpukkeena and  guests  hiawatha weary   heat  summer slumbered   sultry wigwam slowly o’er  simmering landscape fell  evening’s dusk  coolness and  long  level sunbeams shot their spears into  forest breaking through  shields  shadow rushed into each secret ambush searched each thicket dingle hollow still  guests  hiawatha slumbered   silent wigwam from his place rose hiawatha bade farewell  old nokomis spake  whispers spake  this wise did not wake  guests  slumbered “i am going o nokomis on  long  distant journey to  portals   sunset to  regions   homewind of  northwestwind keewaydin but these guests i leave behind me in your watch  ward i leave them see  never harm comes near them see  never fear molests them never danger nor suspicion never want  food or shelter in  lodge  hiawatha” forth into  village went he bade farewell  all  warriors bade farewell  all  young men spake persuading spake  this wise “i am going o my people on  long  distant journey many moons  many winters will have come   have vanished ere i come again  see you but my guests i leave behind me listen  their words  wisdom listen   truth they tell you for  master  life  sent them from  land  light  morning” on  shore stood hiawatha turned  waved his hand  parting on  clear  luminous water launched his birch canoe  sailing from  pebbles   margin shoved  forth into  water whispered  it “westward westward” and  speed  darted forward and  evening sun descending set  clouds  fire  redness burned  broad sky like  prairie left upon  level water one long track  trail  splendor down whose stream  down  river westward westward hiawatha sailed into  fiery sunset sailed into  purple vapors sailed into  dusk  evening and  people   margin watched him floating rising sinking till  birch canoe seemed lifted high into  sea  splendor till  sank into  vapors like  new moon slowly slowly sinking   purple distance and they said “farewell forever” said “farewell o hiawatha” and  forests dark  lonely moved through all their depths  darkness sighed “farewell o hiawatha” and  waves upon  margin rising rippling   pebbles sobbed “farewell o hiawatha” and  heron  shuhshuhgah from her haunts among  fenlands screamed “farewell o hiawatha” thus departed hiawatha hiawatha  beloved in  glory   sunset in  purple mists  evening to  regions   homewind of
