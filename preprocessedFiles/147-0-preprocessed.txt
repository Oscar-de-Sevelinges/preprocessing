our ears deceived  sound however prejudice may warp our wills or interest darken our understanding  simple voice  nature   reason  say   right i draw my idea   form  government   principle  nature which no art can overturn viz   more simple any thing is  less liable     disordered   easier repaired when disordered   this maxim  view i offer  few remarks   so much boasted constitution  england that   noble   dark  slavish times  which   erected  granted when  world  over run  tyranny  least remove therefrom   glorious rescue but    imperfect subject  convulsions  incapable  producing what  seems  promise  easily demonstrated absolute governments tho  disgrace  human nature have this advantage  them  they  simple if  people suffer they know  head  which their suffering springs know likewise  remedy   not bewildered   variety  causes  cures but  constitution  england  so exceedingly complex   nation may suffer  years together without being able  discover  which part  fault lies some  say  one  some  another  every political physician  advise  different medicine i know   difficult  get over local or long standing prejudices yet if we  suffer ourselves  examine  component parts   english constitution we shall find them    base remains  two ancient tyrannies compounded  some new republican materials firstthe remains  monarchical tyranny   person   king secondlythe remains  aristocratical tyranny   persons   peers thirdlythe new republican materials   persons   commons  whose virtue depends  freedom  england the two first  being hereditary  independent   people wherefore   constitutional sense they contribute nothing towards  freedom   state to say   constitution  england   union  three powers reciprocally checking each other  farcical either  words have no meaning or they  flat contradictions to say   commons   check upon  king presupposes two things firstthat  king  not   trusted without being looked after or  other words   thirst  absolute power   natural disease  monarchy secondlythat  commons  being appointed   purpose  either wiser or more worthy  confidence than  crown but   same constitution which gives  commons  power  check  king  withholding  supplies gives afterwards  king  power  check  commons  empowering him  reject their other bills  again supposes   king  wiser than those whom   already supposed   wiser than him a mere absurdity there  something exceedingly ridiculous   composition  monarchy  first excludes  man   means  information yet empowers him  act  cases where  highest judgment  required the state   king shuts him   world yet  business   king requires him  know  thoroughly wherefore  different parts  unnaturally opposing  destroying each other prove  whole character   absurd  useless some writers have explained  english constitution thus  king say they  one  people another  peers   house  behalf   king  commons  behalf   people but this hath all  distinctions   house divided against itself  though  expressions  pleasantly arranged yet when examined they appear idle  ambiguous    always happen   nicest construction  words  capable of when applied   description  some thing which either cannot exist or  too incomprehensible   within  compass  description   words  sound only  though they may amuse  ear they cannot inform  mind  this explanation includes  previous question viz how came  king   power which  people  afraid  trust  always obliged  check such  power could not   gift   wise people neither can any power which needs checking   god yet  provision which  constitution makes supposes such  power  exist but  provision  unequal   task  means either cannot or  not accomplish  end   whole affair   felo de se    greater weight  always carry up  less   all  wheels   machine  put  motion  one  only remains  know which power   constitution   most weight    govern  though  others or  part  them may clog or   phrase is check  rapidity   motion yet so long  they cannot stop it their endeavors   ineffectual  first moving power   last have  way  what  wants  speed  supplied  time that  crown  this overbearing part   english constitution needs not  mentioned    derives  whole consequence merely  being  giver  places  pensions  selfevident wherefore though we have been wise enough  shut  lock  door against absolute monarchy we   same time have been foolish enough  put  crown  possession   key the prejudice  englishmen  favour  their own government  king lords  commons arises  much or more  national pride than reason individuals  undoubtedly safer  england than  some other countries but     king   much  law   land  britain   france  this difference  instead  proceeding directly  his mouth   handed   people under  more formidable shape   act  parliament for  fate  charles  first hath only made kings more subtlenot more just wherefore laying aside all national pride  prejudice  favour  modes  forms  plain truth is    wholly owing   constitution   people  not   constitution   government   crown  not  oppressive  england   turkey an inquiry into  constitutional errors   english form  government   this time highly necessary   we  never   proper condition  doing justice  others while we continue under  influence  some leading partiality so neither  we capable  doing   ourselves while we remain fettered  any obstinate prejudice and   man who  attached   prostitute  unfitted  choose or judge   wife so any prepossession  favour   rotten constitution  government  disable us  discerning  good one of monarchy and hereditary succession mankind being originally equals   order  creation  equality could only  destroyed  some subsequent circumstance  distinctions  rich  poor may   great measure  accounted for   without having recourse   harsh ill sounding names  oppression  avarice oppression  often  consequence but seldom or never  means  riches  though avarice  preserve  man  being necessitously poor  generally makes him too timorous   wealthy but there  another  greater distinction  which no truly natural or religious reason can  assigned   is  distinction  men into kings  subjects male  female   distinctions  nature good  bad  distinctions  heaven but how  race  men came into  world so exalted above  rest  distinguished like some new species  worth enquiring into  whether they   means  happiness or  misery  mankind in  early ages   world according   scripture chronology there  no kings  consequence  which  there  no wars    pride  kings which throw mankind into confusion holland without  king hath enjoyed more peace  this last century than any   monarchial governments  europe antiquity favors  same remark   quiet  rural lives   first patriarchs hath  happy something  them which vanishes away when we come   history  jewish royalty government  kings  first introduced into  world   heathens  whom  children  israel copied  custom it   most prosperous invention  devil ever set  foot   promotion  idolatry the heathens paid divine honors  their deceased kings   christian world hath improved   plan  doing  same  their living ones how impious   title  sacred majesty applied   worm who   midst  his splendor

samuel expressly disapproves  government  kings all antimonarchical parts  scripture have been very smoothly glossed over  monarchical governments but they undoubtedly merit  attention  countries which have their governments yet  form render unto cæsar  things which  cæsars   scripture doctrine  courts yet   no support  monarchical government   jews   time  without  king    state  vassalage   romans near three thousand years passed away   mosaic account   creation till  jews under  national delusion requested  king till then their form  government except  extraordinary cases where  almighty interposed   kind  republic administred   judge   elders   tribes kings they had none    held sinful  acknowledge any being under  title but  lord  hosts and when  man seriously reflects   idolatrous homage which  paid   persons  kings  need not wonder   almighty ever jealous  his honor should disapprove   form  government which so impiously invades  prerogative  heaven monarchy  ranked

charges them  disaffection  their proper sovereign  king  heaven about one hundred  thirty years after this they fell again into  same error the hankering which  jews had   idolatrous customs   heathens  something exceedingly unaccountable but so  was  laying hold   misconduct  samuels two sons who  entrusted  some secular concerns they came   abrupt  clamorous manner  samuel saying behold thou art old  thy sons walk not  thy ways now make us  king  judge us like all other nations and here we cannot but observe  their motives  bad viz  they might  like unto other nations ie  heathens whereas their true glory laid  being  much unlike them  possible but  thing displeased samuel when they said give us  king  judge us  samuel prayed unto  lord   lord said unto samuel hearken unto  voice   people  all  they say unto thee  they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them according  all  works which they have done since  day  i brought them up out  egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me  served other gods so do they also unto thee now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit protest solemnly unto them  shew them  manner   king  shall reign over them ie not  any particular king but  general manner   kings   earth whom israel  so eagerly copying after and notwithstanding  great distance  time  difference  manners  character  still  fashion and samuel told all  words   lord unto  people  asked  him  king and  said this shall   manner   king  shall reign over you   take your sons  appoint them  himself  his chariots    his horsemen  some shall run before his chariots this description agrees   present mode  impressing men    appoint him captains over thousands  captains over fifties   set them  ear his ground   reap his harvest   make his instruments  war  instruments  his chariots    take your daughters   confectionaries    cooks    bakers this describes  expence  luxury  well   oppression  kings    take your fields  your olive yards even  best  them  give them  his servants    take  tenth  your feed   your vineyards  give them  his officers   his servants by which we see  bribery corruption  favoritism   standing vices  kings    take  tenth  your men servants  your maid servants  your goodliest young men  your asses  put them  his work    take  tenth  your sheep  ye shall  his servants  ye shall cry out   day because  your king which ye shall have chosen   lord  not hear you   day this accounts   continuation  monarchy neither do  characters   few good kings which have lived since either sanctify  title or blot out  sinfulness   origin  high encomium given  david takes no notice  him officially   king but only   man after gods own heart nevertheless  people refused  obey  voice  samuel  they said nay but we  have  king over us  we may  like all  nations   our king may judge us  go out before us  fight our battles samuel continued  reason  them but  no purpose  set before them their ingratitude but all would not avail  seeing them fully bent  their folly  cried out i  call unto  lord   shall send thunder  rain which then   punishment being   time  wheat harvest  ye may perceive  see  your wickedness  great which ye have done   sight   lord  asking you  king so samuel called unto  lord   lord sent thunder  rain  day  all  people greatly feared  lord  samuel and all  people said unto samuel pray  thy servants unto  lord thy god  we die not  we have added unto our sins this evil  ask  king these portions  scripture  direct  positive they admit  no equivocal construction that  almighty hath here entered his protest against monarchical government  true or  scripture  false and  man hath good reason  believe  there   much  kingcraft  priestcraft  withholding  scripture   public  popish countries for monarchy  every instance   popery  government to  evil  monarchy we have added   hereditary succession    first   degradation  lessening  ourselves so  second claimed   matter  right   insult   imposition  posterity for all men being originally equals no one  birth could have  right  set up his own family  perpetual preference  all others  ever  though himself might deserve some decent degree  honors  his cotemporaries yet his descendants might  far too unworthy  inherit them one   strongest natural proofs   folly  hereditary right  kings is  nature disapproves it otherwise she would not so frequently turn  into ridicule  giving mankind  ass   lion secondly  no man  first could possess any other public honors than  bestowed upon him so  givers  those honors could have no power  give away  right  posterity  though they might say we choose you  our head they could not without manifest injustice  their children say that your children  your childrens children shall reign over ours  ever because such  unwise unjust unnatural compact might perhaps   next succession put them under  government   rogue or  fool most wise men  their private sentiments have ever treated hereditary right  contempt yet   one  those evils which when once established  not easily removed many submit  fear others  superstition   more powerful part shares   king  plunder   rest this  supposing  present race  kings   world  have had  honorable origin whereas   more than probable  could we take off  dark covering  antiquity  trace them  their first rise  we should find  first  them nothing better than  principal ruffian  some restless gang whose savage manners or preeminence  subtility obtained him  title  chief among plunderers  who  increasing  power  extending his depredations overawed  quiet  defenceless  purchase their safety  frequent contributions yet his electors could have no idea  giving hereditary right  his descendants because such  perpetual exclusion  themselves  incompatible   free  unrestrained principles they professed  live by wherefore hereditary succession   early ages  monarchy could not take place   matter  claim but  something casual or complimental but  few or no records  extant  those days  traditional history stuffed  fables   very easy after  lapse   few generations  trump up some superstitious tale conveniently timed mahomet like  cram hereditary right down  throats   vulgar perhaps  disorders which threatened or seemed  threaten   decease   leader   choice   new one for elections among ruffians could not  very orderly induced many  first  favor hereditary pretensions  which means  happened   hath happened since  what  first  submitted    convenience  afterwards claimed   right england since  conquest hath known some few good monarchs but groaned beneath  much larger number  bad ones yet no man  his senses can say  their claim under william  conqueror   very honorable one a french bastard landing   armed banditti  establishing himself king  england against  consent   natives   plain terms  very paltry rascally originalit certainly hath no divinity  it however   needless  spend much time  exposing  folly  hereditary right if there  any so weak   believe it let them promiscuously worship  ass  lion  welcome i shall neither copy their humility nor disturb their devotion yet i should  glad  ask how they suppose kings came  first the question admits but  three answers viz either  lot  election or  usurpation if  first king  taken  lot  establishes  precedent   next which excludes hereditary succession saul   lot yet  succession  not hereditary neither does  appear   transaction there  any intention  ever should if  first king  any country   election  likewise establishes  precedent   next   say   right  all future generations  taken away   act   first electors  their choice not only   king but   family  kings  ever hath no parrallel  or out  scripture but  doctrine  original sin which supposes  free   all men lost  adam   such comparison    admit  no other hereditary succession can derive no glory for   adam all sinned     first electors all men obeyed    one all mankind  subjected  satan    other  sovereignty  our innocence  lost   first  our authority   last   both disable us  reassuming some former state  privilege  unanswerably follows  original sin  hereditary succession  parellels dishonorable rank inglorious connexion yet  most subtile sophist cannot produce  juster simile as  usurpation no man   so hardy   defend it   william  conqueror   usurper   fact not   contradicted the plain truth is   antiquity  english monarchy  not bear looking into but   not so much  absurdity   evil  hereditary succession which concerns mankind did  ensure  race  good  wise men  would have  seal  divine authority but   opens  door   foolish  wicked   improper  hath    nature  oppression men who look upon themselves born  reign  others  obey soon grow insolent selected   rest  mankind their minds  early poisoned  importance   world they act  differs so materially   world  large  they have but little opportunity  knowing  true interests  when they succeed   government  frequently  most ignorant  unfit  any throughout  dominions another evil which attends hereditary succession is   throne  subject   possessed   minor  any age all which time  regency acting under  cover   king have every opportunity  inducement  betray their trust the same national misfortune happens when  king worn out  age  infirmity enters  last stage  human weakness in both these cases  public becomes  prey  every miscreant who can tamper successfully   follies either  age or infancy the most plausible plea which hath ever been offered  favour  hereditary succession is   preserves  nation  civil wars   this true  would  weighty whereas    most barefaced falsity ever imposed upon mankind the whole history  england disowns  fact thirty kings  two minors have reigned   distracted kingdom since  conquest  which time there have been including  revolution no less than eight civil wars  nineteen rebellions wherefore instead  making  peace  makes against it  destroys  very foundation  seems  stand on the contest  monarchy  succession between  houses  york  lancaster laid england   scene  blood  many years twelve

 itself i am not induced  motives  pride party or resentment  espouse  doctrine  separation  independance i am clearly positively  conscientiously persuaded     true interest  this continent   so  every thing short    mere patchwork   can afford no lasting felicitythat   leaving  sword  our children  shrinking back   time when  little more  little farther would have rendered this continent  glory   earth as britain hath not manifested  least inclination towards  compromise we may  assured  no terms can  obtained worthy  acceptance   continent or any ways equal   expence  blood  treasure we have been already put to the object contended for ought always  bear some just proportion   expence the removal  north or  whole detestable junto   matter unworthy  millions we have expended a temporary stoppage  trade   inconvenience which would have sufficiently ballanced  repeal  all  acts complained of had such repeals been obtained but if  whole continent must take up arms if every man must   soldier   scarcely worth our while  fight against  contemptible ministry only dearly dearly do we pay   repeal   acts if   all we fight for    just estimation    great  folly  pay  bunkerhill price  law   land as i have always considered  independancy  this continent   event which sooner or later must arrive so   late rapid progress   continent  maturity  event could not  far off wherefore   breaking out  hostilities   not worth  while  have disputed  matter which time would have finally redressed unless we meant    earnest otherwise   like wasting  estate   suit  law  regulate  trespasses   tenant whose lease  just expiring no man   warmer wisher  reconciliation than myself before  fatal nineteenth  april  but  moment  event   day  made known i rejected  hardened sullen tempered pharaoh  england  ever  disdain  wretch    pretended title  father  his people can unfeelingly hear  their slaughter  composedly sleep  their blood upon his soul but admitting  matters  now made up what would   event i answer  ruin   continent and   several reasons first the powers  governing still remaining   hands   king   have  negative over  whole legislation  this continent and   hath shewn himself such  inveterate enemy  liberty  discovered such  thirst  arbitrary power  he or   not  proper man  say  these colonies you shall make no laws but what i please and  there any inhabitant  america so ignorant  not  know  according  what  called  present constitution  this continent can make no laws but what  king gives leave to   there any man so unwise  not  see  considering what  happened   suffer no law   made here but such  suit his purpose we may   effectually enslaved   want  laws  america   submitting  laws made  us  england after matters  made up as   called can there  any doubt but  whole power   crown   exerted  keep this continent  low  humble  possible instead  going forward we shall go backward or  perpetually quarrelling or ridiculously petitioningwe  already greater than  king wishes us  be    not hereafter endeavour  make us less to bring  matter  one point is  power who  jealous  our prosperity  proper power  govern us whoever says no  this question   independant  independancy means no more than whether we shall make our own laws or whether  king  greatest enemy this continent hath or can have shall tell us there shall  no laws but such  i like but  king you  say   negative  england  people there can make no laws without his consent in point  right  good order there  something very ridiculous   youth  twentyone which hath often happened shall say  several millions  people older  wiser than himself i forbid this or  act  yours   law but  this place i decline this sort  reply though i  never cease  expose  absurdity  it  only answer  england being  kings residence  america not so makes quite another case the kings negative here  ten times more dangerous  fatal than  can   england  there   scarcely refuse his consent   bill  putting england into  strong  state  defence  possible   america  would never suffer such  bill   passed america  only  secondary object   system  british politics england consults  good  this country no farther than  answers her own purpose wherefore her own interest leads her  suppress  growth  ours  every case which doth not promote her advantage or   least interferes  it a pretty state we should soon   under such  secondhand government considering what  happened men do not change  enemies  friends   alteration   name and  order  shew  reconciliation now   dangerous doctrine i affirm   would  policy   king  this time  repeal  acts   sake  reinstating himself   government   provinces  order   may accomplish  craft  subtilty   long run what  cannot do  force  violence   short one reconciliation  ruin  nearly related secondly that  even  best terms which we can expect  obtain can amount  no more than  temporary expedient or  kind  government  guardianship which can last no longer than till  colonies come  age so  general face  state  things   interim   unsettled  unpromising emigrants  property  not choose  come   country whose form  government hangs but   thread  who  every day tottering   brink  commotion  disturbance  numbers   present inhabitants would lay hold   interval  dispense  their effects  quit  continent but  most powerful  all arguments is  nothing but independance ie  continental form  government can keep  peace   continent  preserve  inviolate  civil wars i dread  event   reconciliation  britain now    more than probable     followed   revolt somewhere or other  consequences  which may  far more fatal than all  malice  britain thousands  already ruined  british barbarity thousands more  probably suffer  same fate those men have other feelings than us who have nothing suffered all they now possess  liberty what they before enjoyed  sacrificed   service  having nothing more  lose they disdain submission besides  general temper   colonies towards  british government   like    youth who  nearly out  his time they  care very little about her and  government which cannot preserve  peace  no government  all    case we pay our money  nothing  pray what    britain can do whose power   wholly  paper should  civil tumult break out  very day after reconciliation i have heard some men say many  whom i believe spoke without thinking  they dreaded  independance fearing   would produce civil wars it  but seldom  our first thoughts  truly correct     case here  there  ten times more  dread   patched up connexion than  independance i make  sufferers case my own  i protest   i driven  house  home my property destroyed  my circumstances ruined   man sensible  injuries i could never relish  doctrine  reconciliation or consider myself bound thereby the colonies have manifested such  spirit  good order  obedience  continental government   sufficient  make every reasonable person easy  happy   head no man can assign  least pretence  his fears  any other grounds than such   truly childish  ridiculous viz  one colony   striving  superiority over another where there  no distinctions there can  no superiority perfect equality affords no temptation the republics  europe  all and we may say always  peace holland  swisserland  without wars foreign or domestic monarchical governments   true  never long  rest  crown itself   temptation  enterprizing ruffians  home   degree  pride  insolence ever attendant  regal authority swells into  rupture  foreign powers  instances where  republican government  being formed  more natural principles would negociate  mistake if there  any true cause  fear respecting independance   because no plan  yet laid down men do not see their way out wherefore   opening into  business i offer  following hints   same time modestly affirming  i have no other opinion  them myself than  they may   means  giving rise  something better could  straggling

settle our affairs so expeditiously   open  determined declaration  independance some  which are firstit   custom  nations when any two   war  some other powers not engaged   quarrel  step   mediators

  ever secondlyit  unreasonable  suppose  france or spain  give us any kind  assistance if we mean only  make use   assistance   purpose  repairing  breach  strengthening  connection between britain  america because those powers would  sufferers   consequences thirdlywhile we profess ourselves  subjects  britain we must   eye  foreign nations  considered  rebels the precedent  somewhat dangerous

received nor heard abroad the custom  all courts  against us    so until   independance we take rank  other nations these proceedings may  first appear strange  difficult but like all other steps which we have already passed over    little time become familiar  agreeable and until  independance  declared  continent  feel itself like  man who continues putting off some unpleasant business  day  day yet knows  must  done hates  set about it wishes  over   continually haunted   thoughts   necessity appendix since  publication   first edition  this pamphlet or rather   same day  which  came out  kings speech made  appearance  this city had  spirit  prophecy directed  birth  this production  could not have brought  forth   more seasonable juncture or  more necessary time the bloody mindedness   one shew  necessity  pursuing  doctrine   other men read  way  revenge and  speech instead  terrifying prepared  way   manly principles  independance ceremony  even silence  whatever motive they may arise have  hurtful tendency when they give  least degree  countenance  base  wicked performances wherefore if this maxim  admitted  naturally follows   kings speech  being  piece  finished villainy deserved  still deserves  general execration both   congress   people yet   domestic tranquillity   nation depends greatly   chastity  what may properly  called national manners   often better  pass some things over  silent disdain than  make use  such new methods  dislike  might introduce  least innovation   guardian  our peace  safety and perhaps   chiefly owing  this prudent delicacy   kings speech hath not before now suffered  public execution the speech if  may  called one  nothing better than  wilful audacious libel against  truth  common good   existence  mankind    formal  pompous method  offering up human sacrifices   pride  tyrants but this general massacre  mankind  one   privileges   certain consequence  kings   nature knows them not they know not her  although they  beings

rank  animals  contemptibly crawls through  world like  worm however  matters very little now what  king  england either says or does  hath wickedly broken through every moral  human obligation trampled nature  conscience beneath his feet    steady  constitutional spirit  insolence  cruelty procured  himself  universal hatred it  now  interest  america  provide  herself she hath already

whatsoever sect or denomination ye  of  well  ye who  more immediately  guardians   public liberty if ye wish  preserve your native country uncontaminated  european corruption ye must  secret wish  separationbut leaving  moral part  private reflection i shall chiefly confine my farther remarks   following heads first that    interest  america   separated  britain secondly which   easiest  most practicable plan reconciliation or independance  some occasional remarks in support   first i could if i judged  proper produce  opinion  some   ablest  most experienced men  this continent  whose sentiments   head  not yet publicly known it   reality  selfevident position for no nation   state  foreign dependance limited   commerce  cramped  fettered   legislative powers can ever arrive  any material eminence america doth not yet know what opulence is  although  progress which she hath made stands unparalleled   history  other nations   but childhood compared  what she would  capable  arriving at had she  she ought  have  legislative powers  her own hands england is  this time proudly coveting what would do her no good  she  accomplish it   continent hesitating   matter which   her final ruin if neglected it   commerce  not  conquest  america  which england    benefited   would   great measure continue   countries  independant  each other  france  spain because  many articles neither can go   better market but    independance  this country  britain or any other which  now  main  only object worthy  contention  which like all other truths discovered  necessity  appear clearer  stronger every day first because   come   one time or other secondly because  longer   delayed  harder     accomplish i have frequently amused myself both  public  private companies  silently remarking  specious errors  those who speak without reflecting and among  many which i have heard  following seems  most general viz  had this rupture happened forty or fifty years hence instead  now  continent would have been more able  have shaken off  dependance to which i reply  our military ability  this time arises   experience gained   last war  which  forty or fifty years time would have been totally extinct the continent would not   time have had  general or even  military officer left  we or those who may succeed us would have been  ignorant  martial matters   ancient indians and this single position closely attended to  unanswerably prove   present time  preferable  all others the argument turns thus   conclusion   last war we had experience but wanted numbers  forty or fifty years hence we should have numbers without experience wherefore  proper point  time must  some particular point between  two extremes  which  sufficiency   former remains   proper increase   latter  obtained and  point  time   present time the reader  pardon this digression   does not properly come under  head i first set out with   which i again return   following position viz should affairs  patched up  britain  she  remain  governing  sovereign power  america which  matters  now circumstanced  giving up  point intirely we shall deprive ourselves   very means  sinking  debt we have or may contract the value   back lands which some   provinces  clandestinely deprived of   unjust extention   limits  canada valued only  five pounds sterling per hundred acres amount  upwards  twentyfive millions pennsylvania currency   quitrents  one penny sterling per acre  two millions yearly it    sale  those lands   debt may  sunk without burthen  any   quitrent reserved thereon  always lessen   time  wholly support  yearly expence  government it matters not how long  debt   paying so   lands when sold  applied   discharge  it    execution  which  congress   time being    continental trustees i proceed now   second head viz which   easiest  most practicable plan reconciliation or independance  some occasional remarks he who takes nature  his guide  not easily beaten out  his argument    ground i answer generallythat independance being  single simple line contained within ourselves  reconciliation  matter exceedingly perplexed  complicated   which  treacherous capricious court   interfere gives  answer without  doubt the present state  america  truly alarming  every man who  capable  reflexion without law without government without any other mode  power than what  founded on  granted  courtesy held together   unexampled concurrence  sentiment which  nevertheless subject  change  which every secret enemy  endeavouring  dissolve our present condition is legislation without law wisdom without  plan constitution without  name and what  strangely astonishing perfect independance contending  dependance the instance  without  precedent  case never existed before  who can tell what may   event the property  no man  secure   present unbraced system  things the mind   multitude  left  random  seeing no fixed object before them they pursue such  fancy or opinion starts nothing  criminal there  no such thing  treason wherefore every one thinks himself  liberty  act   pleases the tories dared not have assembled offensively had they known  their lives   act  forfeited   laws   state a line  distinction should  drawn between english soldiers taken  battle  inhabitants  america taken  arms the first  prisoners but  latter traitors the one forfeits his liberty  other his head notwithstanding our wisdom there   visible feebleness  some  our proceedings which gives encouragement  dissensions the continental belt  too loosely buckled and if something  not done  time    too late  do any thing  we shall fall into  state  which neither reconciliation nor independance   practicable the king  his worthless adherents  got  their old game  dividing  continent  there  not wanting among us printers who   busy  spreading specious falsehoods the artful  hypocritical letter which appeared  few months ago  two   newyork papers  likewise  two others   evidence  there  men who want either judgment or honesty it  easy getting into holes  corners  talking  reconciliation but do such men seriously consider how difficult  task is  how dangerous  may prove should  continent divide thereon do they take within their view all  various orders  men whose situation  circumstances  well  their own    considered therein do they put themselves   place   sufferer whose all  already gone    soldier who hath quitted all   defence  his country if their ill judged moderation  suited  their own private situations only regardless  others  event  convince them  they  reckoning without their host put us say some   footing we    sixtythree to which i answer  request  not now   power  britain  comply with neither  she propose it but if  were  even should  granted i ask   reasonable question by what means  such  corrupt  faithless court   kept   engagements another parliament nay even  present may hereafter repeal  obligation   pretence   being violently obtained or unwisely granted    case where  our redressno going  law  nations cannon   barristers  crowns   sword not  justice but  war decides  suit to    footing  sixtythree   not sufficient   laws only  put   same state but  our circumstances likewise  put   same state our burnt  destroyed towns repaired or built up our private losses made good our public debts contracted  defence discharged otherwise we shall  millions worse than we    enviable period such  request had  been complied   year ago would have won  heart  soul   continent but now   too late the rubicon  passed besides  taking up arms merely  enforce  repeal   pecuniary law seems  unwarrantable   divine law   repugnant  human feelings   taking up arms  enforce obedience thereto the object  either side doth not justify  means   lives  men  too valuable   cast away  such trifles it   violence which  done  threatened  our persons  destruction  our property   armed force  invasion  our country  fire  sword which conscientiously qualifies  use  arms and  instant  which such  mode  defence became necessary all subjection  britain ought  have ceased   independancy  america should have been considered  dating  æra from  published by  first musket   fired against her this line   line  consistency neither drawn  caprice nor extended  ambition but produced   chain  events  which  colonies  not  authors i shall conclude these remarks   following timely  well intended hints we ought  reflect  there  three different ways  which  independancy may hereafter  effected   one  those three  one day or other   fate  america viz by  legal voice   people  congress   military power or   mob it may not always happen  our soldiers  citizens   multitude  body  reasonable men virtue  i have already remarked  not hereditary neither   perpetual should  independancy  brought about   first  those means we have every opportunity  every encouragement before us  form  noblest purest constitution   face   earth we have   our power  begin  world over again a situation similar   present hath not happened since  days  noah until now the birthday   new world   hand   race  men perhaps  numerous  all europe contains   receive their portion  freedom   event   few months the reflexion  awfuland  this point  view how trifling how ridiculous do  little paltry cavellings   few weak or interested men appear when weighed against  business   world should we neglect  present favorable  inviting period   independance  hereafter effected  any other means we must charge  consequence  ourselves or  those rather whose narrow  prejudiced souls  habitually opposing  measure without either inquiring or reflecting there  reasons   given  support  independance which men should rather privately think of than  publicly told of we ought not now   debating whether we shall  independant or not but anxious  accomplish    firm secure  honorable basis  uneasy rather    not yet began upon every day convinces us   necessity even  tories if such beings yet remain among us should  all men   most solicitous  promote it for   appointment  committees  first protected them  popular rage so  wise  well established form  government    only certain means  continuing  securely  them wherefore if they have not virtue enough   whigs they ought  have prudence enough  wish  independance in short independance   only bond  can tye  keep us together we shall then see our object  our ears   legally shut against  schemes   intriguing  well   cruel enemy we shall then too    proper footing  treat  britain  there  reason  conclude   pride   court   less hurt  treating   american states  terms  peace than  those whom she denominates rebellious subjects  terms  accommodation it  our delaying   encourages her  hope  conquest  our backwardness tends only  prolong  war as we have without any good effect therefrom withheld our trade  obtain  redress  our grievances let us now try  alternative  independantly redressing them ourselves  then offering  open  trade the mercantile  reasonable part  england   still  us because peace  trade  preferable  war without it and if this offer  not accepted other courts may  applied to on these grounds i rest  matter and  no offer hath yet been made  refute  doctrine contained   former editions  this pamphlet    negative proof  either  doctrine cannot  refuted or   party  favour    too numerous   opposed wherefore instead  gazing  each other  suspicious or doubtful curiosity let each  us hold out  his neighbour  hearty hand  friendship  unite  drawing  line which like  act  oblivion shall bury  forgetfulness every former dissension let  names  whig  tory  extinct  let none other  heard among us than those   good citizen  open  resolute friend   virtuous supporter

principle since we  called  profess  light  christ jesus manifested  our consciences unto this day   setting up  putting down kings  governments  gods peculiar prerogative  causes best known  himself and    not our business  have any hand or contrivance therein nor   busy bodies above our station much less  plot  contrive  ruin or overturn  any  them but  pray   king  safety  our nation  good  all

 there  your political testimony if you fully believe what  contains and  very publishing  proves  either ye do not believe what ye profess or have not virtue enough  practise what ye believe the principles  quakerism have  direct tendency  make  man  quiet  inoffensive subject  any  every government which  set over him and if  setting up  putting down  kings  governments  gods peculiar prerogative  most certainly  not  robbed thereof  us wherefore  principle itself leads you  approve  every thing which ever happened or may happen  kings  being his work oliver cromwell thanks you charles then died not   hands  man  should  present proud imitator  him come   same untimely end  writers  publishers   testimony  bound   doctrine  contains  applaud  fact kings  not taken away

ordering altering  disposal  kings  governments into  hands  god  now recalling their principles  putting    share   business is  possible   conclusion which  here justly quoted can any ways follow   doctrine laid down the inconsistency  too glaring not   seen  absurdity too great not   laughed at  such  could only have been made  those whose understandings  darkened   narrow  crabby spirit   despairing political party  ye  not   considered   whole body   quakers but only   factional  fractional part thereof here ends  examination  your testimony which i call upon no man  abhor  ye have done but only  read  judge  fairly  which i subjoin  following remark that  setting up  putting down  kings most certainly mean  making him  king who  yet not so   making him no king who  already one and pray what hath this  do   present case we neither mean  set up nor  put down neither  make nor  unmake but  have nothing  do  them wherefore your testimony  whatever light   viewed serves only  dishonor your judgement   many other reasons had better have been let alone than published first because  tends   decrease  reproach  all religion whatever     utmost danger  society  make   party
