you when youve got  apple  beg  core off  you but when theyve got one  you beg   core  remind them how you give them  core one time they say thank you most  death but there aint agoing   no core but i notice they always git come up with all you got  do   wait well we went out   woods   hill  tom told us what  was it   crusade “whats  crusade” i says he looked scornful  way hes always done when   ashamed   person  says “huck finn do you mean  tell me you dont know what  crusade is” “no” says i “i dont and i dont care to nuther ive lived till now  done without it  had my health too but  soon  you tell me ill know  thats soon enough i dont see any use  finding out things  clogging up my head  them when i maynt ever have any occasion  use em there  lance williams  learned how  talk choctaw here till one come  dug his grave  him now then whats  crusade but i can tell you one thing before you begin if its  patentright theres no money  it bill thompson he” “patentright” says he “i never see such  idiot why  crusade   kind  war” i thought  must  losing his mind but no    real earnest  went right on perfectly cam “a crusade   war  recover  holy land   paynim” “which holy land” “why  holy landthere aint but one” “what do we want  it” “why cant you understand its   hands   paynim  its our duty  take  away  them” “how did we come  let them git hold  it” “we didnt come  let them git hold  it they always had it” “why tom then  must belong  them dont it” “why  course  does who said  didnt” i studied over it but couldnt seem  git   right  it no way i says “its too many  me tom sawyer if i had  farm    mine  another person wanted it would   right  him to” “oh shucks you dont know enough  come  when  rains huck finn it aint  farm its entirely different you see its like this they own  land just  mere land  thats all they do own but   our folks our jews  christians  made  holy  so they havent any business   there defiling it its  shame  we ought not  stand   minute we ought  march against them  take  away  them” “why  does seem  me its  most mixedup thing i ever see now if i had  farm  another person” “dont i tell you  hasnt got anything  do  farming farming  business just common lowdown business thats all  is its all you can say  it but this  higher this  religious  totally different” “religious  go  take  land away  people  owns it” “certainly its always been considered so” jim  shook his head  says “mars tom i reckon deys  mistake about  somersdey mos sholy is is religious myself en i knows plenty religious people but i haint run across none dat acts like dat” it made tom hot   says “well its enough  make  body sick such mulletheaded ignorance if either  youd read anything about history youd know  richard cur de loon   pope  godfrey de bulleyn  lots more   most noblehearted  pious people   world hacked  hammered   paynims  more than two hundred years trying  take their land away  them  swum neckdeep  blood  whole timeand yet heres  couple  sapheaded country yahoos out   backwoods  missouri setting themselves up  know more about  rights  wrongs   than they did talk about cheek” well  course  put  more different light  it  me  jim felt pretty cheap  ignorant  wished we hadnt been quite so chipper i couldnt say nothing  jim  couldnt   while then  says “well den i reckon its all right becase ef dey didnt know dey aint no use  po ignorant folks like us   trying  know en so ef its our duty we got  go en tackle  en do de bes we can same time i feel  sorry  dem paynims  mars tom de hard part gwine    kill folks dat  body haint been quainted wid  dat haint done him no harm dats it you see ef we wuz  go mongst em jist we three en say wes hungry en ast em   bite  eat why maybe deys jist like yuther people dont you reckon dey is why deyd give it i know dey would en den” “then what” “well mars tom my idea  like dis it aint no use we cant kill dem po strangers dat aint doin us no harm till weve had practicei knows  perfectly well mars tomdeed i knows  perfectly well but ef we takes a axe or two jist you en me en huck en slips acrost de river tonight arter de moons gone down en kills dat sick famly dats over   sny en burns dey house down en” “oh you make me tired” says tom “i dont want  argue any more  people like you  huck finn thats always wandering   subject  aint got any more sense than  try  reason out  thing thats pure theology   laws  protect real estate” now thats just where tom sawyer warnt fair jim didnt mean no harm  i didnt mean no harm we knowed well enough    right  we  wrong  all we  after   get   how  it    all   only reason  couldnt explain  so we could understand   because we  ignorantyes  pretty dull too i aint denying that but land  aint no crime i should think but  wouldnt hear no more about itjust said if we had tackled  thing   proper spirit  would a raised  couple  thousand knights  put them  steel armor  head  heel  made me  lieutenant  jim  sutler  took  command himself  brushed  whole paynim outfit into  sea like flies  come back across  world   glory like sunset but  said we didnt know enough  take  chance when we had it   wouldnt ever offer  again and  didnt when  once got set you couldnt budge him but i didnt care much i am peaceable  dont get up rows  people  aint doing nothing  me i allowed if  paynim  satisfied i was  we would let  stand  that now tom  got all  notion out  walter scotts book which   always reading and  was  wild notion because  my opinion  never couldve raised  men  if  did  like  not  wouldve got licked i took  book  read all about it   near  i could make  out most   folks  shook farming  go crusading had  mighty rocky time  it chapter ii the balloon ascension well tom got up one thing after another but they all had tender spots about em somewheres   had  shove em aside so  last   about  despair then  st louis papers begun  talk  good deal about  balloon   going  sail  europe  tom sort  thought  wanted  go down  see what  looked like but couldnt make up his mind but  papers went  talking  so  allowed  maybe if  didnt go  mightnt ever have another chance  see  balloon  next  found out  nat parsons  going down  see it   decided him  course he wasnt going  have nat parsons coming back bragging about seeing  balloon  him having  listen    keep quiet so  wanted me  jim  go too  we went it   noble big balloon  had wings  fans  all sorts  things  wasnt like any balloon you see  pictures it  away out toward  edge  town   vacant lot corner  twelfth street  there   big crowd around it making fun  it  making fun   mana lean pale feller   soft kind  moonlight  his eyes you knowand they kept saying  wouldnt go it made him hot  hear them   would turn  them  shake his fist  say they  animals  blind but some day they would find they had stood face  face  one   men  lifts up nations  makes civilizations   too dull  know it  right here  this spot their own children  grandchildren would build  monument  him  would outlast  thousand years but his name would outlast  monument and then  crowd would burst out   laugh again  yell  him  ask him what  his name before   married  what  would take  not do it  what  his sisters cats grandmothers name  all  things   crowd says when theyve got hold   feller  they see they can plague well some things they said was funnyyes  mighty witty too i aint denying thatbut all  same  warnt fair nor brave all them people pitching  one  they so glib  sharp  him without any gift  talk  answer back with but good land what did  want  sass back for you see  couldnt do him no good    just nuts  them they had him you know but   his way i reckon  couldnt help it   made so i judge he   good enough sort  cretur  hadnt no harm  him   just  genius   papers said which wasnt his fault we cant all  sound weve got    way were made as near  i can make out geniuses think they know  all  so they wont take peoples advice but always go their own way which makes everybody forsake them  despise them    perfectly natural if they  humbler  listened  tried  learn  would  better  them the part  professor    like  boat   big  roomy  had watertight lockers around  inside  keep all sorts  things in   body could sit  them  make beds  them too we went aboard  there  twenty people there snooping around  examining  old nat parsons  there too the professor kept fussing around getting ready   people went ashore drifting out one   time  old nat    last of course  wouldnt do  let him go out behind us we mustnt budge till   gone so we could  last ourselves but   gone now so   time  us  follow i heard  big shout  turned aroundthe city  dropping  under us like  shot it made me sick all through i  so scared jim turned gray  couldnt say  word  tom didnt say nothing but looked excited the city went  dropping down  down  down but we didnt seem   doing nothing but just hang   air  stand still the houses got smaller  smaller   city pulled itself together closer  closer   men  wagons got  looking like ants  bugs crawling around   streets like threads  cracks  then  all kind  melted together  there wasnt any city any more   only  big scar   earth   seemed  me  body could see up  river  down  river about  thousand miles though  course  wasnt so much by    earth   balljust  round ball   dull color  shiny stripes wriggling  winding around over it which  rivers the widder douglas always told me  earth  round like  ball but i never took any stock   lot  them superstitions o hers   course i paid no attention   one because i could see myself   world   shape   plate  flat i used  go up   hill  take  look around  prove   myself because i reckon  best way  get  sure thing   fact   go  examine  yourself  not take anybodys sayso but i had  give  now   widder  right that is she  right    rest   world but she warnt right about  part our village  in  part   shape   plate  flat i take my oath the professor had been quiet all this time  if   asleep but  broke loose now    mighty bitter he says something like this “idiots they said  wouldnt go  they wanted  examine it  spy around  get  secret   out  me but i beat them nobody knows  secret but me nobody knows what makes  move but me  its  new powera new power   thousand times  strongest   earth steams foolishness  it they said i couldnt go  europe to europe why theres power aboard  last five years  feed  three months they  fools what do they know about it yes  they said my airship  flimsy why shes good  fifty years i can sail  skies all my life if i want to  steer where i please though they laughed  that  said i couldnt couldnt steer come here boy well see you press these buttons  i tell you” he made tom steer  ship all about  every which way  learnt him  whole thing  nearly no time  tom said   perfectly easy he made him fetch  ship down most   earth  had him spin her along so close   illinois prairies   body could talk   farmers  hear everything they said perfectly plain   flung out printed bills  them  told about  balloon  said   going  europe tom got so  could steer straight   tree till  got nearly  it  then dart up  skin right along over  top  it yes   showed tom how  land her   done  firstrate too  set her down   prairies  soft  wool but  minute we started  skip out  professor says “no you dont”  shot her up   air again it  awful i begun  beg  so did jim but  only give his temper  rise   begun  rage around  look wild out  his eyes  i  scared  him well then  got   his troubles again  mourned  grumbled about  way   treated  couldnt seem  git over it  especially peoples saying his ship  flimsy he scoffed  that   their saying she warnt simple  would  always getting out  order get out  order that graveled him  said  she couldnt any more get out  order than  solar sister he got worse  worse  i never see  person take  so it give me  cold shivers  see him  so  did jim by    got  yelling  screaming  then  swore  world shouldnt ever have his secret  all now  had treated him so mean he said  would sail his balloon around  globe just  show what  could do  then  would sink    sea  sink us all along  it too well    awfulest fix   in  here  night coming on he give us something  eat  made us go   other end   boat   laid down   locker where  could boss all  works  put his old pepperbox revolver under his head  said if anybody come fooling around there trying  land her  would kill him we set scrunched up together  thought considerable but didnt say muchonly just  word once   while when  body had  say something or bust we  so scared  worried the night dragged along slow  lonesome we  pretty low down   moonshine made everything soft  pretty   farmhouses looked snug  homeful  we could hear  farm sounds  wished we could  down there but laws we just slipped along over them like  ghost  never left  track away   night when all  sounds  late sounds   air had  late feel   late smell tooabout  twooclock feel  near  i could make outtom said  professor  so quiet this time  must  asleep  wed better “better what” i says   whisper  feeling sick all over because i knowed what   thinking about “better slip back there  tie him  land  ship”  says i says “no sir don you budge tom sawyer” and jimwell jim  kind o gasping   so scared he says “oh mars tom dont ef you teches him wes gonewes gone sho i aint gwine anear him not  nothin  dis worl mars tom hes plumb crazy” tom whispers  says“thats why weve got  do something if  wasnt crazy i wouldnt give shucks   anywhere but here you couldnt hire me  get outnow  ive got used  this balloon  over  scare  being cut loose   solid groundif    his right mind but its no good politics sailing around like this   person thats out  his head  says hes going round  world  then drown us all weve got  do something i tell you  do  before  wakes up too or we maynt ever get another chance come” but  made us turn cold  creepy just  think  it  we said we wouldnt budge so tom   slipping back there  himself  see if  couldnt get   steeringgear  land  ship we begged  begged him not to but  warnt no use so  got down  his hands  knees  begun  crawl  inch   time we aholding our breath  watching after  got   middle   boat  crept slower than ever   did seem like years  me but  last we see him get   professors head  sort  raise up soft  look  good spell  his face  listen then we see him begin  inch along again toward  professors feet where  steeringbuttons was well  got there all safe   reaching slow  steady toward  buttons but  knocked down something  made  noise  we see him slump down flat an soft   bottom  lay still the professor stirred  says “whats that” but everybody kept dead still  quiet   begun  mutter  mumble  nestle like  person thats going  wake up  i thought i  going  die i  so worried  scared then  cloud slid over  moon  i most cried i  so glad she buried herself deeper  deeper into  cloud   got so dark we couldnt see tom then  began  sprinkle rain  we could hear  professor fussing  his ropes  things  abusing  weather we  afraid every minute  would touch tom  then we would  goners  no help but tom  already  his way back  when we felt his hands  our knees my breath stopped sudden  my heart fell down mongst my other works because i couldnt tell   dark but  might   professor which i thought  was dear i  so glad  have him back  i  just  near happy   person could    up   air  way   deranged man you cant land  balloon   dark  so i hoped  would keep  raining  i didnt want tom  go meddling any more  make us so awful uncomfortable well i got my wish it drizzled  drizzled along  rest   night which wasnt long though  did seem so   daybreak  cleared   world looked mighty soft  gray  pretty   forests  fields so good  see again   horses  cattle standing sober  thinking next  sun come ablazing up gay  splendid  then we began  feel rusty  stretchy  first we knowed we  all asleep chapter iii tom explains we went  sleep about four oclock  woke up about eight the professor  setting back there  his end looking glum he pitched us some breakfast but  told us not  come abaft  midship compass that  about  middle   boat well when you  sharpset  you eat  satisfy yourself everything looks pretty different  what  done before it makes  body feel pretty near comfortable even when   up   balloon   genius we got  talking together there  one thing  kept bothering me     i says “tom didnt we start east” “yes” “how fast have we been going” “well you heard what  professor said when   raging round sometimes  said we  making fifty miles  hour sometimes ninety sometimes  hundred said    gale  help  could make three hundred any time  said if  wanted  gale  wanted  blowing  right direction  only had  go up higher or down lower  find it” “well then its just  i reckoned the professor lied” “why” “because if we  going so fast we ought   past illinois oughtnt we” “certainly” “well we aint” “whats  reason we aint” “i know   color were right over illinois yet and you can see  yourself  indiana aint  sight” “i wonder whats  matter  you huck you know   color” “yes  course i do” “whats  color got  do  it” “its got everything  do  it illinois  green indiana  pink you show me any pink down here if you can no sir its green” “indiana pink why what  lie” “it aint no lie ive seen    map  its pink” you never see  person so aggravated  disgusted he says “well if i  such  numbskull  you huck finn i would jump over seen    map huck finn did you reckon  states   same color outofdoors  they    map” “tom sawyer whats  map for aint   learn you facts” “of course” “well then hows  going  do  if  tells lies thats what i want  know” “shucks you muggins it dont tell lies” “it dont dont it” “no  dont” “all right then if  dont there aint no two states  same color you git around that if you can tom sawyer” he see i had him  jim see  too  i tell you i felt pretty good  tom sawyer  always  hard person  git ahead of jim slapped his leg  says “i tell you dats smart dats right down smart aint no use mars tom  got you dis time sho” he slapped his leg again  says “my lan but   smart one” i never felt so good  my life  yet i didnt know i  saying anything much till   out i  just mooning along perfectly careless  not expecting anything  going  happen  never thinking  such  thing  all when all   sudden out  came why   just  much  surprise  me     any  them it  just  same way   when  person  munching along   hunk  cornpone  not thinking about anything  all   sudden bites into  dimond now all  he knows first off   its some kind  gravel hes bit into but  dont find out its  dimond till  gits  out  brushes off  sand  crumbs  one thing or another    look  it  then hes surprised  gladyes  proud too though when you come  look  thing straight   eye  aint entitled   much credit   would a been if hed been hunting dimonds you can see  difference easy if you think  over you see  accident  way aint fairly  big  thing   thing thats done apurpose anybody could find  dimond   cornpone but mind you its got   somebody thats got that kind of a cornpone thats where  fellers credit comes in you see  thats where mine comes in i dont claim no great thingsi dont reckon i could a done  againbut i done   time thats all i claim and i hadnt no more idea i could do such  thing  warnt any more thinking about  or trying to than you  this minute why i  just  cam  body couldnt  any camer  yet all   sudden out  come ive often thought   time  i can remember just  way everything looked same  if   only last week i can see  all beautiful rolling country  woods  fields  lakes  hundreds  hundreds  miles all around  towns  villages scattered everywheres under us here  there  yonder   professor mooning over  chart  his little table  toms cap flopping   rigging where   hung up  dry and one thing  particular   bird right alongside not ten foot off going our way  trying  keep up but losing ground all  time   railroad train doing  same thing down there sliding among  trees  farms  pouring out  long cloud  black smoke  now  then  little puff  white  when  white  gone so long you had almost forgot it you would hear  little faint toot     whistle and we left  bird   train both behind way behind  done  easy too but tom   huffy  said me  jim   couple  ignorant blatherskites  then  says “suppose theres  brown calf   big brown dog   artist  making  picture  them what   main thing   artist  got  do he  got  paint them so you can tell them apart  minute you look  them haint he of course well then do you want him  go  paint both  them brown certainly you dont he paints one  them blue  then you cant make no mistake its just  same   maps thats why they make every state  different color  aint  deceive you its  keep you  deceiving yourself” but i couldnt see no argument about that  neither could jim jim shook his head  says “why mars tom if you knowed what chuckleheads dem painters is youd wait  long time before youd fetch one er dem   back up  fac is gwine  tell you den you kin see  youself i see one  em

yonder   took up  glass  looked  it  then looked  his silver turnip  then   clock  then   turnip again  says “thats funny that clocks near about  hour fast” so  put up his turnip then  see another clock  took  look     hour fast too that puzzled him “thats  mighty curious thing”  says “i dont understand it” then  took  glass  hunted up another clock  sure enough    hour fast too then his eyes began  spread  his breath  come out kinder gaspy like   says “gerreat scott its  longitude” i says considerably scared “well whats been  gone  happened now” “why  thing thats happened   this old bladder  slid over illinois  indiana  ohio like nothing  this   east end  pennsylvania or new york or somewheres around there” “tom sawyer you dont mean it” “yes i do  its dead sure weve covered about fifteen degrees  longitude since we left st louis yesterday afternoon  them clocks  right weve come close   eight hundred miles” i didnt believe it but  made  cold streaks trickle down my back just  same in my experience i knowed  wouldnt take much short  two weeks  do  down  mississippi   raft jim  working his mind  studying pretty soon  says “mars tom did you say dem clocks uz right” “yes theyre right” “aint yo watch right too” “shes right  st louis but shes  hour wrong  here” “mars tom  you tryin  let  dat de time aint de same everywheres” “no  aint  same everywheres   long shot” jim looked distressed  says “it grieves me  hear you talk like dat mars tom is right down ashamed  hear you talk like dat arter de way yous been raised yassir itd break yo aunt pollys heart  hear you” tom

made  day   made  night but  didnt invent  hours   didnt distribute them around man did that” “mars tom  dat so man done it” “certainly” “who tole him  could” “nobody he never asked” jim studied

before  new york” jim moved  little way along  locker  you could see   insulted he kept shaking his head  muttering  so i slid along  him  patted him   leg  petted him up  got him over  worst  his feelings  then  says “mars tom talkin sich talk  dat choosday  one place en monday  tother bofe   same day huck dis aint no place  jokeup here whah we is two days  one day how you gwine  get two days

back i wants   whah” all   sudden we see something  all jumped up  forgot everything  begun  gaze tom says “aint  the” he catched his breath then says “it is sure  you live its  ocean” that made me  jim catch our breath too then we all stood petrified but happy  none  us had ever seen  ocean or ever expected to tom kept muttering “atlantic oceanatlantic land dont  sound great and thats itand we  looking  itwe why its just too splendid  believe” then we see  big bank  black smoke  when we got nearer    cityand  monster she was too   thick fringe  ships around one edge  we wondered if   new york  begun  jaw  dispute about it and first we knowed  slid  under us  went flying behind  here we was out over  very ocean itself  going like  cyclone then we woke up i tell you we made  break aft  raised  wail  begun  beg  professor  turn back  land us but  jerked out his pistol  motioned us back  we went but nobody  ever know how bad we felt the land  gone all but  little streak like  snake away off   edge   water  down under us  just ocean ocean oceanmillions  miles  it heaving  pitching  squirming  white sprays blowing   wavetops  only  few ships  sight wallowing around  laying over first  one side  then  tother  sticking their bows under  then their sterns  before long there warnt no ships  all  we had  sky   whole ocean all  ourselves   roomiest place i ever see   lonesomest chapter iv storm and  got lonesomer  lonesomer there   big sky up there empty  awful deep   ocean down there without  thing   but just  waves all around us   ring where  sky   water come together yes  monstrous big ring  was  we right   dead center  itplumb   center we  racing along like  prairie fire but  never made any difference we couldnt seem  git past  center no way i couldnt see  we ever gained  inch   ring it made  body feel creepy   so curious  unaccountable well everything  so awful still  we got  talking   very low voice  kept  getting creepier  lonesomer  less  less talky till  last  talk ran dry altogether  we just set there  “thunk”  jim calls it  never said  word  longest time the professor never stirred till  sun  overhead then  stood up  put  kind  triangle  his eye  tom said    sextant    taking  sun  see whereabouts  balloon was then  ciphered  little  looked   book  then  begun  carry  again he said lots  wild things and among others  said  would keep up this hundredmile gait till  middle  tomorrow afternoon  then hed land  london we said we would  humbly thankful he  turning away but  whirled around when we said that  give us  long look  his blackest kindone   maliciousest  suspiciousest looks i ever see then  says “you want  leave me dont try  deny it” we didnt know what  say so we held   didnt say nothing  all he went aft  set down but  couldnt seem  git  thing out  his mind every now  then  would rip out something about it  try  make us answer him but we dasnt it got lonesomer  lonesomer right along   did seem  me i couldnt stand it it  still worse when night begun  come on by   tom pinched me  whispers “look” i took  glance aft  see  professor taking  whet out   bottle i didnt like  looks  that by    took another drink  pretty soon  begun  sing it  dark now  getting black  stormy he went  singing wilder  wilder   thunder begun  mutter   wind  wheeze  moan among  ropes  altogether   awful it got so black we couldnt see him any more  wished we couldnt hear him but we could then  got still but  warnt still ten minutes till we got suspicious  wished  would start up his noise again so we could tell where  was by   there   flash  lightning  we see him start  get up but  staggered  fell down we heard him scream out   dark “they dont want  go  england all right ill change  course they want  leave me i know they do well they shalland now” i most died when  said that then   still againstill so long i couldnt bear it   did seem  me  lightning wouldnt ever come again but  last there   blessed flash  there  was  his hands  knees crawling  not four feet  us my but his eyes  terrible he made  lunge  tom  says “overboard you go” but   already pitchdark again  i couldnt see whether  got him or not  tom didnt make  sound there  another long horrible wait then there   flash  i see toms head sink down outside  boat  disappear he    ropeladder  dangled down   air   gunnel the professor let off  shout  jumped  him  straight off   pitchdark again  jim groaned out “po mars tom hes  goner”  made  jump   professor but  professor warnt there then we heard  couple  terrible screams  then another not so loud  then another   way below  you could only just hear it  i heard jim say “po mars tom” then   awful still  i reckon  person could a counted four thousand before  next flash come when  come i see jim  his knees  his arms   locker  his face buried  them    crying before i could look over  edge   all dark again  i  glad because i didnt want  see but when  next flash come i  watching  down there i see somebody aswinging   wind   ladder    tom “come up” i shouts “come up tom” his voice  so weak   wind roared so i couldnt make out what  said but i thought  asked   professor up there i shouts “no hes down   ocean come up can we help you” of course all this   dark “huck who  you hollerin at” “im hollerin  tom” “oh huck how kin you act so when you know po mars tom” then  let off  awful scream  flung his head  his arms back  let off another one because there   white glare just then   had raised up his face just  time  see toms  white  snow rise above  gunnel  look him right   eye he thought   toms ghost you see tom clumb aboard  when jim found  was him  not his ghost  hugged him  called him all sorts  loving names  carried  like   gone crazy   so glad says i “what did you wait for tom why didnt you come up  first” “i dasnt huck i knowed somebody plunged down past me but i didnt know who     dark it could a been you  could a been jim” that   way  tom sawyeralways sound he warnt coming up till  knowed where  professor was the storm let go about this time  all  might    dreadful  way  thunder boomed  tore   lightning glared out   wind sung  screamed   rigging   rain come down one second you couldnt see your hand before you   next you could count  threads  your coatsleeve  see  whole wide desert  waves pitching  tossing through  kind  veil  rain a storm like    loveliest thing there is but  aint   best when you  up   sky  lost  its wet  lonesome  theres just been  death   family we set there huddled up   bow  talked low about  poor professor  everybody  sorry  him  sorry  world had made fun  him  treated him so harsh when   doing  best  could  hadnt  friend nor nobody  encourage him  keep him  brooding his mind away  going deranged there  plenty  clothes  blankets  everything   other end but we thought wed ruther take  rain than go meddling back there chapter v land we tried  make some plans but we couldnt come  no agreement me  jim   turning around  going back home but tom allowed    time daylight come so we could see our way we would  so far toward england  we might  well go there  come back   ship  have  glory  saying we done it about midnight  storm quit   moon come out  lit up  ocean  we begun  feel comfortable  drowsy so we stretched out   lockers  went  sleep  never woke up again till sunup the sea  sparkling like dimonds    nice weather  pretty soon our things  all dry again we went aft  find some breakfast   first thing we noticed   there   dim light burning   compass back there under  hood then tom  disturbed he says “you know what  means easy enough it means  somebody  got  stay  watch  steer this thing  same   would  ship or shell wander around  go wherever  wind wants her to” “well” i says “whats she been doing sinceersince we had  accident” “wandering”  says kinder troubled“wandering without any doubt shes   wind now thats blowing her south  east we dont know how long thats been going on either” so then  pinted her east  said  would hold her there till we rousted out  breakfast the professor had laid  everything  body could want  couldnt a been better fixed there wasnt no milk   coffee but there  water  everything else you could want   charcoal stove   fixings  it  pipes  cigars  matches  wine  liquor which warnt  our line  books  maps  charts   accordion  furs  blankets  no end  rubbish like brass beads  brass jewelry which tom said   sure sign   had  idea  visiting among savages there  money too yes  professor  well enough fixed after breakfast tom learned me  jim how  steer  divided us all up into fourhour watches turn  turn about  when his watch  out i took his place   got out  professors papers  pens  wrote  letter home  his aunt polly telling her everything  had happened  us  dated  “in the welkin approaching england”  folded  together  stuck  fast   red wafer  directed it  wrote above  direction  big writing “from tom sawyer the erronort”  said  would stump old nat parsons  postmaster when  come along   mail i says “tom sawyer this aint no welkin its  balloon” “well now who said    welkin smarty” “youve wrote    letter anyway” “what  it that dont mean   balloons  welkin” “oh i thought  did well then what   welkin” i see   minute   stuck he raked  scraped around  his mind but  couldnt find nothing so  had  say “i dont know  nobody dont know its just  word  its  mighty good word too there aint many  lays over it i dont believe theres any  does” “shucks” i says “but what does  meanthats  pint” “i dont know what  means i tell you its  word  people uses forforwell its ornamental they dont put ruffles   shirt  keep  person warm do they” “course they dont” “but they put them on dont they” “yes” “all right then  letter i wrote   shirt   welkins  ruffle  it” i judged   would gravel jim   did “now mars tom  aint no use  talk like dat en moreover its sinful you knows  letter aint no shirt en dey aint no ruffles  it nuther dey aint no place  put em on you cant put em on  dey wouldnt stay ef you did” “oh do shut up  wait till somethings started  you know something about” “why mars tom sholy you cant mean  say i dont know about shirts when goodness knows is toted home de washin ever sence” “i tell you this hasnt got anything  do  shirts i only” “why mars tom you said yoself dat  letter” “do you want  drive me crazy keep still i only used    metaphor” that word kinder bricked us up   minute then jim saysrather timid because  see tom  getting pretty tetchy “mars tom what   metaphor” “a metaphors awell its aaa metaphors  illustration” he see that didnt git home so  tried again “when i say birds   feather flocks together its  metaphorical way  saying” “but dey dont mars tom no sir deed dey dont dey aint no feathers dats more alike den  bluebird en  jaybird but ef you waits till you catches dem birds together youll” “oh give us  rest you cant get  simplest little thing through your thick skull now dont bother me any more” jim  satisfied  stop he  dreadful pleased  himself  catching tom out the minute tom begun  talk about birds i judged    goner because jim knowed more about birds than both  us put together you see  had killed hundreds  hundreds  them  thats  way  find out about birds thats  way people does  writes books about birds  loves them so  theyll go hungry  tired  take any amount  trouble  find  new bird  kill it their name  ornithologers  i could have been  ornithologer myself because i always loved birds  creatures  i started out  learn how   one  i see  bird setting   limb   high tree singing   head tilted back   mouth open  before i thought i fired  his song stopped   fell straight down   limb all limp like  rag  i run  picked him up    dead  his body  warm  my hand  his head rolled about this way  that like his neck  broke  there   little white skin over his eyes  one little drop  blood   side  his head and laws i couldnt see nothing more   tears  i haint never murdered no creature since  warnt doing me no harm  i aint going to but i  aggravated about  welkin i wanted  know i got  subject up again  then tom explained  best  could he said when  person made  big speech  newspapers said  shouts   people made  welkin ring he said they always said that but none  them ever told what  was so  allowed  just meant outdoors  up high well  seemed sensible enough so i  satisfied  said so that pleased tom  put him   good humor again   says “well its all right then  well let bygones  bygones i dont know  certain what  welkin is but when we land  london well make  ring anyway  dont you forget it” he said  erronort   person who sailed around  balloons  said    mighty sight finer   tom sawyer  erronort than   tom sawyer  traveler  we would  heard  all round  world if we pulled through all right  so  wouldnt give shucks    traveler now toward  middle   afternoon we got everything ready  land  we felt pretty good too  proud  we kept watching   glasses like columbus discovering america but we couldnt see nothing but ocean the afternoon wasted out   sun shut down  still there warnt no land anywheres we wondered what   matter but reckoned  would come out all right so we went  steering east but went up   higher level so we wouldnt hit any steeples or mountains   dark it  my watch till midnight  then   jims but tom stayed up because  said ship captains done  when they  making  land  didnt stand no regular watch well when daylight come jim give  shout  we jumped up  looked over  there   land sure enoughland all around  far  you could see  perfectly level  yaller we didnt know how long wed been over it there warnt no trees nor hills nor rocks nor towns  tom  jim had took    sea they took    sea   dead cam but we  so high up anyway  if  had been  sea  rough  would a looked smooth all  same   night  way we  all   powerful excitement now  grabbed  glasses  hunted everywheres  london but couldnt find hair nor hide  it nor any other settlementnor any sign   lake or  river either tom  clean beat he said  warnt his notion  england  thought england looked like america  always had  idea so  said we better have breakfast  then drop down  inquire  quickest way  london we cut  breakfast pretty short we  so impatient as we slanted along down  weather began  moderate  pretty soon we shed our furs but  kept on moderating    precious little while   most too moderate we  close down now  just blistering we settled down  within thirty foot   landthat is   land if sand  land  this wasnt anything but pure sand tom  me clumb down  ladder  took  run  stretch our legs   felt amazing goodthat is  stretching did but  sand scorched our feet like hot embers next we see somebody coming  started  meet him but we heard jim shout  looked around    fairly dancing  making signs  yelling we couldnt make out what  said but we  scared anyway  begun  heel  back   balloon when we got close enough we understood  words  they made me sick “run run fo yo life hits  lion i kin see him thoo de glass run boys do please heel  de bes you kin hes busted outen de menagerie en dey aint nobody  stop him” it made tom fly but  took  stiffening all out  my legs i could only just gasp along  way you do   dream when theres  ghost gaining  you tom got   ladder  shinned up   piece  waited  me   soon  i got  foothold    shouted  jim  soar away but jim had clean lost his head  said  had forgot how so tom shinned along up  told me  follow but  lion  arriving fetching  most ghastly roar  every lope  my legs shook so i dasnt try  take one  them out   rounds  fear  other one would give way under me but tom  aboard  this time   started  balloon up  little  stopped  again  soon   end   ladder  ten or twelve feet above ground and there   lion aripping around under me  roaring  springing up   air   ladder  only missing  about  quarter   inch  seemed  me it  delicious   out  his reach perfectly delicious  made me feel good  thankful all up one side but i  hanging there helpless  couldnt climb   made me feel perfectly wretched  miserable all down  other it  most seldom   person feels so mixed like that    not   recommended either tom asked me what hed better do but i didnt know he asked me if i could hold  whilst  sailed away   safe place  left  lion behind i said i could if  didnt go no higher than   now but if  went higher i would lose my head  fall sure so  said “take  good grip”   started “dont go so fast” i shouted “it makes my head swim” he had started like  lightning express he slowed down  we glided over  sand slower but still   kind  sickening way   is uncomfortable  see things sliding  gliding under you like that  not  sound but pretty soon there  plenty  sound   lion  catching up his noise fetched others you could see them coming   lope  every direction  pretty soon there   couple  dozen  them under me jumping up   ladder  snarling  snapping  each other  so we went skimming along over  sand  these fellers doing what they could  help us  not forgit  occasion  then some other beasts come without  invite  they started  regular riot down there we see this plan   mistake we couldnt ever git away  them  this gait  i couldnt hold  forever so tom took  think  struck another idea that was  kill  lion   pepperbox revolver  then sail away while  others stopped  fight over  carcass so  stopped  balloon still  done it  then we sailed off while  fuss  going on  come down  quarter   mile off  they helped me aboard but   time we  out  reach again  gang   hand once more and when they see we  really gone  they couldnt get us they sat down  their hams  looked up  us so kind  disappointed     much   person could do not  see their side   matter chapter vi its a caravan i was so weak   only thing i wanted   chance  lay down so i made straight  my lockerbunk  stretched myself out there but  body couldnt get back his strength  no such oven  that so tom give  command  soar  jim started her aloft we had  go up  mile before we struck comfortable weather where   breezy  pleasant  just right  pretty soon i  all straight again tom had been setting quiet  thinking but now  jumps up  says “i bet you  thousand  one i know where we are were   great sahara  sure  guns” he  so excited  couldnt hold still but i wasnt i says “well then wheres  great sahara in england or  scotland” “taint  either its  africa” jims eyes bugged out   begun  stare down  no end  interest because   where his originals come from but i didnt more than half believe it i couldnt you know  seemed too awful far away  us  have traveled but tom  full  his discovery   called it  said  lions   sand meant  great desert sure he said  could a found out before we sighted land  we  crowding  land somewheres if  had thought  one thing  when we asked him what  said “these clocks theyre chronometers you always read about them  sea voyages one  them  keeping grinnage time   other  keeping st louis time like my watch when we left st louis   four   afternoon  my watch  this clock    ten  night  this grinnage clock well  this time   year  sun sets  about seven oclock now i noticed  time yesterday evening when  sun went down    halfpast five oclock   grinnage clock  half past  am  my watch   other clock you see  sun rose  set  my watch  st louis   grinnage clock  six hours fast but weve come so far east   comes within less than half  hour  setting   grinnage clock now  im away outmore than four hours   half out you see  meant  we  closing up   longitude  ireland  would strike  before long if we  pinted rightwhich we wasnt no sir weve been awanderingwandering way down south  east  its my opinion we   africa look  this map you see how  shoulder  africa sticks out   west think how fast weve traveled if we had gone straight east we would  long past england  this time you watch  noon all  you  well stand up  when we cant cast  shadow well find  this grinnage clock  coming mighty close  marking twelve yes sir i think were  africa  its just bully” jim  gazing down   glass he shook his head  says “mars tom i reckon deys  mistake somers haint seen no niggers yit” “thats nothing they dont live   desert what  that way off yonder gimme  glass” he took  long look  said   like  black string stretched across  sand but  couldnt guess what  was “well” i says “i reckon maybe youve got  chance now  find out whereabouts this balloon is because  like  not   one  these lines here thats   map  you call meridians  longitude  we can drop down  look   number and” “oh shucks huck finn i never see such  lunkhead  you did you spose theres meridians  longitude   earth” “tom sawyer theyre set down   map  you know  perfectly well  here they are  you can see  yourself” “of course theyre   map but thats nothing there aint any   ground” “tom do you know    so” “certainly i do” “well then  maps  liar again i never see such  liar   map” he fired up  that  i  ready  him  jim  warming his opinion too  next minute wed a broke loose  another argument if tom hadnt dropped  glass  begun  clap his hands like  maniac  sing out “camelscamels” so i grabbed  glass  jim too  took  look but i  disappointed  says “camels your granny theyre spiders” “spiders   desert you shad spiders walking   procession you dont ever reflect huck finn  i reckon you really havent got anything  reflect with dont you know were  much   mile up   air    string  crawlers  two or three miles away spiders good land spiders  big   cow perhaps youd like  go down  milk one  em but theyre camels just  same its  caravan thats what  is  its  mile long” “well then lets go down  look  it i dont believe  it  aint going  till i see   know it” “all right”  says  give  command “lower away” as we come slanting down into  hot weather we could see    camels sure enough plodding along  everlasting string  them  bales strapped  them  several hundred men  long white robes   thing like  shawl bound over their heads  hanging down  tassels  fringes  some   men had long guns  some hadnt  some  riding  some  walking and  weatherwell   just roasting and how slow they did creep along we swooped down now all   sudden  stopped about  hundred yards over their heads the men all set up  yell  some  them fell flat  their stomachs some begun  fire their guns  us   rest broke  scampered every which way  so did  camels we see  we  making trouble so we went up again about  mile   cool weather  watched them  there it took them  hour  get together  form  procession again then they started along but we could see   glasses  they wasnt paying much attention  anything but us we poked along looking down  them   glasses     we see  big sand mound  something like people  other side  it  there  something like  man laying  top   mound  raised his head up every now  then  seemed   watching  caravan or us we didnt know which as  caravan got nearer  sneaked down   other side  rushed   other men  horsesfor   what they wasand we see them mount   hurry  next here they come like  house afire some  lances  some  long guns  all  them yelling  best they could they come atearing down    caravan   next minute both sides crashed together   all mixed up  there  such another popping  guns  you never heard   air got so full  smoke you could only catch glimpses  them struggling together there must a been six hundred men   battle    terrible  see then they broke up into gangs  groups fighting tooth  nail  scurrying  scampering around  laying into each other like everything  whenever  smoke cleared  little you could see dead  wounded people  camels scattered far  wide  all about  camels racing off  every direction at last  robbers see they couldnt win so their chief sounded  signal  all   left  them broke away  went scampering across  plain the last man  go snatched up  child  carried  off  front  him  his horse   woman run screaming  begging after him  followed him away off across  plain till she  separated  long ways  her people but  warnt no use  she had  give  up  we see her sink down   sand  cover her face  her hands then tom took  hellum  started   yahoo  we come awhizzing down  made  swoop  knocked him out   saddle child  all    jarred considerable but  child wasnt hurt but laid there working  hands  legs   air like  tumblebug thats   back  cant turn over the man went staggering off  overtake his horse  didnt know what had hit him  we  three or four hundred yards up   air  this time we judged  woman would go  get  child now but she didnt we could see her through  glass still setting there  her head bowed down  her knees so  course she hadnt seen  performance  thought her child  clean gone   man she  nearly  half  mile  her people so we thought we might go down   child which  about  quarter   mile beyond her  snake   her before  caravan people could git  us  do us any harm  besides we reckoned they had enough business  their hands  one while anyway   wounded we thought wed chance it  we did we swooped down  stopped  jim shinned down  ladder  fetched up  kid which   nice fat little thing    noble good humor too considering   just out   battle  been tumbled off   horse  then we started   mother  stopped back  her  tolerable near by  jim slipped down  crept up easy  when   close back  her  child googood  way  child does  she heard it  whirled  fetched  shriek  joy  made  jump   kid  snatched   hugged it  dropped   hugged jim  then snatched off  gold chain  hung  around jims neck  hugged him again  jerked up  child again asobbing  glorifying all  time  jim  shoved   ladder  up it    minute we  back up   sky   woman  staring up   back  her head between her shoulders   child   arms locked around her neck and there she stood  long  we   sight asailing away   sky chapter vii tom respects the flea “noon” says tom  so  was his shadder  just  blot around his feet we looked   grinnage clock  so close  twelve  difference didnt amount  nothing so tom said london  right north  us or right south  us one or tother   reckoned   weather   sand   camels   north   good many miles north too  many   new york   city  mexico  guessed jim said  reckoned  balloon   good deal  fastest thing   world unless  might  some kinds  birdsa wild pigeon maybe

lockers reading sometimes taking  nap it didnt seem like we   same lot    such  state  find land  git ashore but  was but we had got over thatclean over it we  used   balloon now  not afraid any more

if i had my way i wouldnt allow nobody  load his troubles   other folks  aint acquainted with  tother side   world  way well up   balloon there aint any  that  its  darlingest place there is we had supper   night  one   prettiest nights i ever see the moon made  just like daylight only  heap softer  once we see  lion standing all alone  himself just all alone   earth  seemed like  his shadder laid   sand  him like  puddle  ink thats  kind  moonlight  have mainly we laid  our backs  talked we didnt want  go  sleep tom said we  right   midst   arabian nights now he said   right along here  one   cutest things   book happened so we looked down  watched while  told about it because there aint anything   so interesting  look    place   book  talked about it   tale about  cameldriver  had lost his camel   come along   desert  met  man  says “have you run across  stray camel today” and  man says “was  blind  his left eye” “yes” “had  lost  upper front tooth” “yes” “was his off hind leg lame” “yes” “was  loaded  milletseed  one side  honey   other” “yes but you neednt go into no more detailsthats  one  im   hurry where did you see him” “i haint seen him  all”  man says “haint seen him  all how can you describe him so close then” “because when  person knows how  use his eyes everything  got  meaning  it but most peoples eyes aint any good  them i knowed  camel had been along because i seen his track i knowed   lame  his off hind leg because  had favored  foot  trod light  it  his track showed it i knowed   blind  his left side because  only nibbled  grass   right side   trail i knowed  had lost  upper front tooth because where  bit into  sod his teethprint showed it the milletseed sifted out  one sidethe ants told me that  honey leaked out   otherthe flies told me that i know all about your camel but i haint seen him” jim says “go on mars tom hits  mighty good tale  powerful interestin” “thats all” tom says “all” says jim astonished “what come o de camel” “i dont know” “mars tom dont de tale say” “no” jim puzzled  minute then  says “well ef dat aint de beatenes tale ever i struck jist gits  de place whah de intrust  gittin redhot en down she breaks why mars tom dey aint no sense   tale dat acts like dat haint you got no idea whether de man got de camel back er not” “no i havent” i see myself there warnt no sense   tale  chop square off  way before  come  anything but i warnt going  say so because i could see tom  souring up pretty fast over  way  flatted out   way jim had popped    weak place  it  i dont think its fair  everybody  pile    feller when hes down but tom  whirls  me  says “what do you think   tale” of course then i had  come out  make  clean breast  say  did seem  me too same   did  jim   long   tale stopped square   middle  never got  no place  really warnt worth  trouble  telling toms chin dropped  his breast  stead  being mad  i reckoned hed be  hear me scoff  his tale  way  seemed   only sad   says “some people can see  some cantjust   man said let alone  camel if  cyclone had gone by you duffers wouldnt a noticed  track” i dont know what  meant  that   didnt say   just one  his irrulevances i reckonhe  full  them sometimes when     close place  couldnt see no other way outbut i didnt mind wed spotted  soft place   tale sharp enough  couldnt git away   little fact it graveled him like  nation too i reckon much   tried not  let on chapter viii the disappearing lake we had  early breakfast   morning  set looking down   desert   weather  ever so bammy  lovely although we warnt high up you have  come down lower  lower after sundown   desert because  cools off so fast  so   time   getting toward dawn you  skimming along only  little ways above  sand we  watching  shadder   balloon slide along  ground  now  then gazing off across  desert  see if anything  stirring  then down   shadder again when all   sudden almost right under us we see  lot  men  camels laying scattered about perfectly quiet like they  asleep we shut off  power  backed up  stood over them  then we see  they  all dead it give us  cold shivers and  made us hush down too  talk low like people   funeral we dropped down slow  stopped  me  tom clumb down  went among them there  men  women  children they  dried   sun  dark  shriveled  leathery like  pictures  mummies you see  books and yet they looked just  human you wouldnt a believed it just like they  asleep some   people  animals  partly covered  sand but most  them not   sand  thin there   bed  gravel  hard most   clothes had rotted away  when you took hold   rag  tore   touch like spiderweb tom reckoned they had been laying there  years some   men had rusty guns  them some had swords   had shawl belts  long silvermounted pistols stuck  them all  camels had their loads  yet but  packs had busted or rotted  spilt  freight out   ground we didnt reckon  swords  any good   dead people any more so we took one apiece  some pistols we took  small box too because   so handsome  inlaid so fine  then we wanted  bury  people but there warnt no way  do   we could think of  nothing  do   but sand   would blow away again  course then we mounted high  sailed away  pretty soon  black spot   sand  out  sight  we wouldnt ever see them poor people again  this world we wondered  reasoned  tried  guess how they come   there  how  all happened  them but we couldnt make  out first we thought maybe they got lost  wandered around  about till their food  water give out  they starved  death but tom said no wild animals nor vultures hadnt meddled  them  so  guess wouldnt do so  last we give  up  judged we wouldnt think about  no more because  made us lowspirited then we opened  box   had gems  jewels  it quite  pile  some little veils   kind  dead women had on  fringes made out  curious gold money  we warnt acquainted with we wondered if we better go  try  find them again  give  back but tom thought  over  said no    country   full  robbers  they would come  steal it  then  sin would   us  putting  temptation  their way so we went on but i wished we had took all they had so there wouldnt a been no temptation  all left we had had two hours   blazing weather down there   dreadful thirsty when we got aboard again we went straight   water but   spoiled  bitter besides being pretty near hot enough  scald your mouth we couldnt drink it it  mississippi river water  best   world  we stirred up  mud    see if  would help but no  mud wasnt any better than  water well we hadnt been so very very thirsty before while we  interested   lost people but we  now   soon  we found we couldnt have  drink we  more than thirtyfive times  thirsty  we   quarter   minute before why   little while we wanted  hold our mouths open  pant like  dog tom said  keep  sharp lookout all around everywheres because wed got  find  oasis or there warnt no telling what would happen so we done it we kept  glasses gliding around all  time till our arms got so tired we couldnt hold them any more two hoursthree hoursjust gazing  gazing  nothing but sand sand sand  you could see  quivering heatshimmer playing over it dear dear  body dont know what real misery  till   thirsty all  way through   certain  aint ever going  come  any water any more at last i couldnt stand   look around  them baking plains i laid down   locker  give  up but    tom raised  whoop  there she was a lake wide  shiny  pamtrees leaning over  asleep  their shadders   water just  soft  delicate  ever you see i never see anything look so good it   long ways off but  warnt anything  us we just slapped   hundredmile gait  calculated   there  seven minutes but she stayed  same old distance away all  time we couldnt seem  gain  her yes sir just  far  shiny  like  dream but we couldnt get no nearer   last all   sudden she  gone toms eyes took  spread   says “boys    myridge” said  like   glad i didnt see nothing   glad about i says “maybe i dont care nothing about  name  thing i want  know is whats become  it” jim  trembling all over  so scared  couldnt speak but  wanted  ask  question himself if  could a done it tom says “whats become  it why you see yourself its gone” “yes i know but wheres  gone to” he looked me over  says “well now huck finn where would  go to dont you know what  myridge is” “no i dont what  it” “it aint anything but imagination there aint anything to

tell you you didnt see  eitherbecause  warnt there  see” it astonished jim  hear him talk so   broke   says kind  pleading  distressed “mars tom please dont say sich things  sich  awful time  dis you

aint gwine  doubt it dah she  nowa sailin thoo de sky like she allays done” tom turned  me then  says “what do you sayis  sun standing still” “tom sawyer whats  use  ask such  jackass question anybody  aint blind can see  dont stand still” “well”  says “im lost   sky  no company but  passel  lowdown animals  dont know no more than  head boss   university did three or four hundred years ago” it warnt fair play  i let him know it i says “throwin mud aint arguin tom sawyer” “oh my goodness oh my goodness gracious dahs de lake agin” yelled jim just then “now mars tom what you gwine  say” yes sir there   lake again away yonder across  desert perfectly plain trees  all just  same    before i says “i reckon youre satisfied now tom sawyer” but  says perfectly cam “yes satisfied there aint no

bless you honey i couldnt ef i wanted to” we went atearing along toward it piling  miles behind us like nothing but never gaining  inch  itand all   sudden   gone again jim staggered  most fell down when  got his breath  says gasping like  fish “mars tom hits  ghos dats what  is en i hopes  goodness we aint gwine  see  no mo deys been  lake en suthins happened en de lakes dead en wes seen  ghos

en doan know de danger wes in” “ghost you gander it aint anything but air  heat  thirstiness pasted together   persons imagination if igimme  glass” he grabbed   begun  gaze off   right “its  flock  birds”  says “its getting toward sundown  theyre making  beeline across our track  somewheres they mean businessmaybe theyre going  food or water or both let her go  starboardport your hellum hard down thereease upsteady  you go” we shut down some   power so  not  outspeed them  took out after them we went skimming along  quarter   mile behind them  when we had followed them  hour   half   getting pretty discouraged   thirsty clean  unendurableness tom says “take  glass one  you  see what  is away ahead   birds” jim got  first glimpse  slumped down   locker sick he  most crying  says “shes dah agin mars tom shes dah agin en i knows is gwine  die case when  body sees  ghos de third time dats what  means i wisht id never come  dis balloon dat i does” he wouldnt look no more  what  said made me afraid too because i knowed   true    always been  way  ghosts so then i wouldnt look any more either both  us begged tom  turn off  go some other way but  wouldnt  said we  ignorant superstitious blatherskites yes  hell git come up with one  these days i says  myself insulting ghosts  way theyll stand    while maybe but they wont stand  always  anybody  knows about ghosts knows how easy they  hurt  how revengeful they are so we  all quiet  still jim  me being scared  tom busy by   tom fetched  balloon   standstill  says “now get up  look you sapheads” we done it  there   sureenough water right under usclear  blue  cool  deep  wavy   breeze  loveliest sight  ever was and all about   grassy banks  flowers  shady groves  big trees looped together  vines  all looking so peaceful  comfortableenough  make  body cry   so beautiful jim did cry  rip  dance  carry on   so thankful  out  his mind  joy it  my watch so i had  stay   works but tom  jim clumb down  drunk  barrel apiece  fetched me up  lot  ive tasted  many  good thing  my life but nothing  ever begun   water then we went down  had  swim  then tom came up  spelled me  me  jim had  swim  then jim spelled tom  me  tom had  footrace   boxingmill  i dont reckon i ever had such  good time  my life it warnt so very hot because   close   evening  we hadnt any clothes on anyway clothes  well enough  school   towns   balls too but there aint no sense  them when there aint no civilization nor other kinds  bothers  fussiness around “lions acominlions quick mars tom jump  yo life huck” oh  didnt we we never stopped  clothes but waltzed up  ladder just so jim lost his head straight offhe always done  whenever  got excited  scared  so now stead  just easing  ladder up   ground  little so  animals couldnt reach it  turned   raft  power  we went whizzing up   dangling   sky before  got his wits together  seen what  foolish thing   doing then  stopped her but  had clean forgot what  do next so there we was so high   lions looked like pups  we  drifting off   wind but tom  shinned up  went   works  begun  slant her down  back toward  lake where  animals  gathering like  campmeeting  i judged  had lost his head too   knowed i  too scared  climb  did  want  dump me among  tigers  things but no his head  level  knowed what   about he swooped down  within thirty or forty feet   lake  stopped right over  center  sung out “leggo  drop” i done it  shot down feet first  seemed  go about  mile toward  bottom  when i come up  says “now lay  your back  float till youre rested  got your pluck back then ill dip  ladder   water  you can climb aboard” i done it now   ever so smart  tom because if  had started off somewheres else  drop down   sand  menagerie would a come along too  might a kept us hunting  safe place till i got tuckered out  fell and all this time  lions  tigers  sorting out  clothes  trying  divide them up so there would  some  all but there   misunderstanding about  somewheres  account  some  them trying  hog more than their share so there  another insurrection  you never see anything like    world there must a been fifty  them all mixed up together snorting  roaring  snapping  biting  tearing legs  tails   air  you couldnt tell which  which   sand  fur aflying and when they got done some  dead  some  limping off crippled   rest  setting around   battlefield some  them licking their sore places   others looking up  us  seemed   kind  inviting us  come down  have some fun but which we didnt want any as   clothes they warnt any any more every last rag  them  inside   animals  not agreeing  them very well i dont reckon  there  considerable many brass buttons  them  there  knives   pockets too  smoking tobacco  nails  chalk  marbles  fishhooks  things but i wasnt caring all   bothering me was  all we had now   professors clothes  big enough assortment but not suitable  go into company with if we came across any because  britches   long  tunnels   coats  things according still there  everything  tailor needed  jim   kind  jack legged tailor   allowed  could soon trim  suit or two down  us  would answer chapter ix tom discourses on the desert still we thought we would drop down there  minute but  another errand most   professors cargo  food  put up  cans   new way  somebody had just invented  rest  fresh when you fetch missouri beefsteak   great sahara you want   particular  stay up   coolish weather so we reckoned we would drop down into  lion market  see how we could make out there we hauled   ladder  dropped down till we  just above  reach   animals then we let down  rope   slipknot    hauled up  dead lion  small tender one then yanked up  cub tiger we had  keep  congregation off   revolver or they would a took  hand   proceedings  helped we carved off  supply  both  saved  skins  hove  rest overboard then we baited some   professors hooks   fresh meat  went afishing we stood over  lake just  convenient distance above  water  catched  lot   nicest fish you ever see it   most amazing good supper we had lion steak tiger steak fried fish  hot cornpone i dont want nothing better than that we had some fruit  finish off with we got  out   top   monstrous tall tree it   very slim tree  hadnt  branch     bottom plumb   top  there  bursted out like  featherduster it   pamtree  course anybody knows  pamtree  minute  see it   pictures we went  cocoanuts  this one but there warnt none there  only big loose bunches  things like oversized grapes  tom allowed they  dates because  said they answered  description   arabian nights   other books of course they mightnt be  they might  poison so we had  wait  spell  watch  see if  birds et them they done it so we done it too  they  most amazing good by this time monstrous big birds begun  come  settle   dead animals they  plucky creturs they would tackle one end   lion   being gnawed   other end  another lion if  lion drove  bird away  didnt do no good   back again  minute  lion  busy the big birds come out  every part   skyyou could make them out   glass while they  still so far away you couldnt see them  your naked eye tom said  birds didnt find out  meat  there   smell they had  find  out  seeing it oh but aint   eye  you tom said   distance  five mile  patch  dead lions couldnt look any bigger than  persons fingernail   couldnt imagine how  birds could notice such  little thing so far off it  strange  unnatural  see lion eat lion  we thought maybe they warnt kin but jim said  didnt make no difference he said  hog  fond  her own children  so   spider   reckoned maybe  lion  pretty near  unprincipled though maybe not quite he thought likely  lion wouldnt eat his own father if  knowed which  him but reckoned  would eat his brotherinlaw if   uncommon hungry  eat his motherinlaw any time but reckoning dont settle nothing you can reckon till  cows come home but  dont fetch you  no decision so we give  up  let  drop generly   very still   desert nights but this time there  music a lot  other animals come  dinner sneaking yelpers  tom allowed  jackals  roachedbacked ones   said  hyenas  all  whole biling  them kept up  racket all  time they made  picture   moonlight   more different than any picture i ever see we had  line out  made fast   top   tree  didnt stand no watch but all turned   slept but i  up two or three times  look down   animals  hear  music it  like having  front seat   menagerie  nothing which i hadnt ever had before  so  seemed foolish  sleep  not make  most  it i mightnt ever have such  chance again we went afishing again   early dawn  then lazied around all day   deep shade   island taking turn about  watch  see  none   animals come asnooping around there after erronorts  dinner we  going  leave  next day but couldnt   too lovely the day after when we rose up toward  sky  sailed off eastward we looked back  watched  place till  warnt nothing but just  speck   desert  i tell you   like saying goodbye   friend  you aint ever going  see any more jim  thinking  himself   last  says “mars tom wes mos  de end er de desert now i speck” “why” “well hit stan  reason we is you knows how long wes been askimmin over it mus  mos out o san hits  wonder  me dat its hilt out  long   has” “shucks theres plenty sand you neednt worry” “oh i aint aworryin mars tom only wonderin dats all de lords got plenty san i aint doubtin dat but nemmine he aint gwyne  wase  jist  dat account en i allows dat dis deserts plenty big enough now jist de way she is en you cant spread her out no mo dout wasin san” “oh go long we aint much more than fairly started across this desert yet the united states   pretty big country aint it aint it huck” “yes” i says “there aint no bigger one i dont reckon” “well”  says “this desert  about  shape   united states  if you   lay  down  top   united states  would cover  land   free out  sight like  blanket thered   little corner sticking out up  maine  away up northwest  florida sticking out like  turtles tail  thats all weve took california away   mexicans two or three years ago so  part   pacific coast  ours now  if you laid  great sahara down  her edge   pacific she would cover  united states  stick out past new york six hundred miles into  atlantic ocean” i say “good land have you got  documents  that tom sawyer” “yes  theyre right here  ive been studying them you can look  yourself from new york   pacific   miles from one end   great desert   other   the united states contains  square miles  desert contains  with  deserts bulk you could cover up every last inch   united states   under where  edges projected out you could tuck england scotland ireland france denmark  all germany yes sir you could hide  home   brave  all  them countries clean out  sight under  great sahara  you would still have  square miles  sand left” “well” i says “it clean beats me why tom  shows   lord took  much pains makin this desert  makin  united states  all them other countries” jim says “huck dat don stan  reason i reckon dis desert want made  all now you take en look   like disyou look  it  see ef is right whats  desert good for taint good  nuthin dey aint no way  make  pay haint dat so huck” “yes i reckon” “haint  so mars tom” “i guess so go on” “ef  thing aint no good its made  vain aint it” “yes” “now den do de lord make anything  vain you answer me dat” “wellno he dont” “den how come he make  desert” “well go on how did he come  make it” “mars tom i blieve  uz jes like when yous buildin  house deys allays  lot o truck en rubbish lef over what does you do wid it doan you take en kyart  off en dump  into  ole vacant back lot course now den its my opinion hit  jes like datdat de great sahara warnt made  all she jes happen” i said    real good argument  i believed    best one jim ever made tom  said  same but said  trouble about arguments is they aint nothing but theories after all  theories dont prove nothing they only give you  place  rest on  spell when you  tuckered out butting around  around trying  find out something there aint no way to find out and  says “theres another trouble about theories theres always  hole  them somewheres sure if you look close enough its just so  this one  jims look what billions  billions  stars there is how does  come  there  just exactly enough starstuff  none left over how does  come there aint no sandpile up there” but jim  fixed  him  says “whats de milky waydats what i want  know whats de milky way answer me dat” in my opinion   just  sockdologer its only  opinion its only my opinion  others may think different but i said  then  i stand   nowit   sockdologer and moreover besides  landed tom sawyer he couldnt say  word he had  stunned look   person thats been shot   back   kag  nails all  said was   people like me  jim hed just  soon have intellectual intercourse   catfish but anybody can say thatand i notice they always do when somebody  fetched them  lifter tom sawyer  tired   end   subject so we got back  talking about  size   desert again   more we compared   this    tother thing  more nobler  bigger  grander  got  look right along and so hunting among  figgers tom found   by    just  same size   empire  china then  showed us  spread  empire  china made   map   room she took up   world well   wonderful  think of  i says “why ive heard talk about this desert plenty  times but i never knowed before how important she was” then tom says “important sahara important thats just  way  some people if  things big its important thats all  sense theyve got all they can see  size why look  england its  most important country   world  yet you could put   chinas vestpocket  not only that but youd have  dickenss own time  find  again  next time you wanted it and look  russia it spreads all around  everywhere  yet aint no more important  this world than rhode island is  hasnt got half  much   thats worth saving” away off now we see  little hill astanding up just   edge   world tom broke off his talk  reached   glass very much excited  took  look  says “thats itits  one ive been looking for sure if im right its  one  dervish took  man into  showed him all  treasures” so we begun  gaze   begun  tell about  out   arabian nights chapter x the treasurehill tom said  happened like this a dervish  stumping  along through  desert  foot one blazing hot day   had come  thousand miles   pretty poor  hungry  ornery  tired  along about where we  now  run across  cameldriver   hundred camels  asked him  some ams but  cameldriver  asked   excused the dervish said “dont you own these camels” “yes theyre mine” “are you  debt” “whome no” “well  man  owns  hundred camels  aint  debt  richand not only rich but very rich aint  so” the cameldriver owned up    so then  dervish says “god  made you rich  he  made me poor he  his reasons  they  wise blessed  his name but he  willed  his rich shall help his poor  you have turned away  me your brother  my need  he  remember this  you  lose  it” that made  cameldriver feel shaky but all  same   born hoggish after money  didnt like  let go  cent so  begun  whine  explain  said times  hard  although  had took  full freight down  balsora  got  fat rate  it  couldnt git no return freight  so  warnt making no great things out  his trip so  dervish starts along again  says “all right if you want  take  risk but i reckon youve made  mistake this time  missed  chance” of course  cameldriver wanted  know what kind   chance  had missed because maybe there  money  it so  run after  dervish  begged him so hard  earnest  take pity  him   last  dervish gave in  says “do you see  hill yonder well   hill  all  treasures   earth  i  looking around   man   particular good kind heart   noble generous disposition because if i could find just  man ive got  kind   salve i could put  his eyes   could see  treasures  get them out” so then  cameldriver    sweat   cried  begged  took on  went down  his knees  said   just  kind   man  said  could fetch  thousand people  would say  wasnt ever described so exact before “well then” says  dervish “all right if we load  hundred camels can i have half  them” the driver  so glad  couldnt hardly hold in  says “now youre shouting” so they shook hands   bargain   dervish got out his box  rubbed  salve   drivers right eye   hill opened   went in  there sure enough  piles  piles  gold  jewels sparkling like all  stars  heaven had fell down so him   dervish laid into it  they loaded every camel till  couldnt carry no more then they said goodbye  each  them started off  his fifty but pretty soon  cameldriver come arunning  overtook  dervish  says “you aint  society you know  you dont really need all youve got wont you  good  let me have ten  your camels” “well”  dervish says “i dont know but what you say  reasonable enough” so  done it  they separated   dervish started off again  his forty but pretty soon here comes  cameldriver bawling after him again  whines  slobbers around  begs another ten off  him saying thirty camel loads  treasures  enough  see  dervish through because they live very simple you know  dont keep house but board around  give their note but  warnt  end yet that ornery hound kept coming  coming till  had begged back all  camels  had  whole hundred then   satisfied  ever so grateful  said  wouldnt ever forgit  dervish  long   lived  nobody hadnt been so good  him before  liberal so they shook hands goodbye  separated  started off again but do you know  warnt ten minutes till  cameldriver  unsatisfied againhe   lowdownest reptyle  seven countiesand  come arunning again and this time  thing  wanted   get  dervish  rub some   salve  his other eye “why” said  dervish “oh you know” says  driver “know what” “well you cant fool me” says  driver “youre trying  keep back something  me you know  mighty well you know i reckon  if i had  salve   other eye i could see  lot more things thats valuable comeplease put  on” the dervish says “i wasnt keeping anything back  you i dont mind telling you what would happen if i put  on youd never see again youd  stoneblind  rest  your days” but do you know  beat wouldnt believe him no  begged  begged  whined  cried till  last  dervish opened his box  told him  put  on if  wanted to so  man done it  sure enough    blind   bat   minute then  dervish laughed  him  mocked  him  made fun  him  says “goodbyea man thats blind haint got no use  jewelry” and  cleared out   hundred camels  left  man  wander around poor  miserable  friendless  rest  his days   desert jim said hed bet    lesson  him “yes” tom says “and like  considerable many lessons  body gets they aint no account because  thing dont ever happen  same way againand cant the time hen scovil fell down  chimbly  crippled his back  life everybody said  would   lesson  him what kind   lesson how   going  use it he couldnt climb chimblies no more   hadnt no more backs  break” “all de same mars tom dey is sich  thing  learnin  expeence de good book say de burnt chile shun de fire” “well i aint denying   things  lesson if its  thing  can happen twice just  same way theres lots  such things  they educate  person thats what uncle abner always said but theres forty million lots   other kindthe kind  dont happen  same way twiceand they aint no real use they aint no more instructive than  smallpox when youve got it  aint no good  find out you ought  been vaccinated   aint no good  git vaccinated afterward because  smallpox dont come but once but   other hand uncle abner said   person  had took  bull   tail once had learnt sixty or seventy times  much   person  hadnt  said  person  started   carry  cat home   tail  gitting knowledge   always going   useful  him  warnt ever going  grow dim or doubtful but i can tell you jim uncle abner  down  them people thats all  time trying  dig  lesson out  everything  happens no matter whether” but jim  asleep tom looked kind  ashamed because you know  person always feels bad when   talking uncommon fine  thinks  other person  admiring   other person goes  sleep  way of course  oughtnt  go  sleep because its shabby but  finer  person talks  certainer    make you sleep  so when you come  look    aint nobodys fault  particular both  thems  blame jim begun  snoresoft  blubbery  first then  long rasp then  stronger one then  half  dozen horrible ones like  last water sucking down  plughole   bathtub then  same  more power  it  some big coughs  snorts flung in  way  cow does   choking  death  when  person  got   point    his level best  can wake up  man     next block   dipperful  loddanum  him but cant wake himself up although all  awful noise  hisn aint but three inches  his own ears and    curiosest thing   world seems  me but you rake  match  light  candle   little bit   noise  fetch him i wish i knowed what   reason  that but there dont seem   no way  find out now there  jim alarming  whole desert  yanking  animals out  miles  miles around  see what   nation  going  up there there warnt nobody nor nothing    close   noise  he was  yet    only cretur  wasnt disturbed  it we yelled  him  whooped  him  never done no good but  first time there come  little wee noise  wasnt   usual kind  woke him up no sir ive thought  all over  so  tom  there aint no way  find out why  snorer cant hear himself snore jim said  hadnt been asleep  just shut his eyes so  could listen better tom said nobody warnt accusing him that made him look like  wished  hadnt said anything and  wanted  git away   subject i reckon because  begun  abuse  cameldriver just  way  person does when   got catched  something  wants  take  out  somebody else he let into  cameldriver  hardest  knowed how  i had  agree  him   praised up  dervish  highest  could  i had  agree  him there too but tom says “i aint so sure you call  dervish so dreadful liberal  good  unselfish but i dont quite see it he didnt hunt up another poor dervish did he no  didnt if   so unselfish why didnt  go  there himself  take  pocketful  jewels  go along   satisfied no sir  person   hunting    man   hundred camels he wanted  get away  all  treasure  could” “why mars tom   willin  divide fair  square  only struck  fifty camels” “because  knowed how   going  get all  them   by” “mars tom  tole de man de truck would make him bline” “yes because  knowed  mans character it  just  kind   man   hunting fora man  never believes  anybodys word or anybodys honorableness because  aint got none  his own i reckon theres lots  people like  dervish they swindle right  left but they always make  other person seem  swindle himself they keep inside   letter   law all  time  there aint no way  git hold  them they dont put  salve onoh no  would  sin but they know how  fool you into putting  on then its you  blinds yourself i reckon  dervish   cameldriver  just  paira fine smart brainy rascal   dull coarse ignorant one but both  them rascals just  same” “mars tom does you reckon deys any o dat kind o salve  de worl now” “yes uncle abner says there is he says theyve got   new york  they put   country peoples eyes  show them all  railroads   world  they go   git them  then when they rub  salve   other eye  other man bids them goodbye  goes off  their railroads heres  treasurehill now lower away” we landed but  warnt  interesting  i thought   going  be because we couldnt find  place where they went   git  treasure still   plenty interesting enough just  see  mere hill itself where such  wonderful thing happened jim said  woudnt a missed   three dollars  i felt  same way and  me  jim  wonderful  thing  any   way tom could come into  strange big country like this  go straight  find  little hump like   tell    minute   million other humps   almost just like it  nothing  help him but only his own learning  his own natural smartness we talked  talked  over together but couldnt make out how  done it he had  best head  him i ever see  all  lacked  age  make  name  himself equal  captain kidd or george washington i bet you  would a crowded either  them  find  hill  all their gifts but  warnt nothing  tom sawyer  went across sahara  put his finger    easy  you could pick  nigger out   bunch  angels we found  pond  salt water close   scraped up  raft  salt around  edges  loaded up  lions skin   tigers so  they would keep till jim could tan them chapter xi the sandstorm we went afooling along   day or two  then just   full moon  touching  ground   other side   desert we see  string  little black figgers moving across  big silver face you could see them  plain  if they  painted   moon  ink it  another caravan we cooled down our speed  tagged along after it just  have company though  warnt going our way it   rattler  caravan   most bully sight  look  next morning when  sun come astreaming across  desert  flung  long shadders   camels   gold sand like  thousand granddaddylonglegses marching  procession we never went very near it because we knowed better now than  act like   scare peoples camels  break up their caravans it   gayest outfit you ever see  rich clothes  nobby style some   chiefs rode  dromedaries  first we ever see  very tall  they go plunging along like they   stilts  they rock  man    them pretty violent  churn up his dinner considerable i bet you but they make noble good time   camel aint nowheres  them  speed the caravan camped during  middle part   day  then started again about  middle   afternoon before long  sun begun  look very curious first  kind  turned  brass  then  copper  after   begun  look like  bloodred ball   air got hot  close  pretty soon all  sky   west darkened up  looked thick  foggy but fiery  dreadfullike  looks through  piece  red glass you know we looked down  see  big confusion going    caravan   rushing every which way like they  scared  then they all flopped down flat   sand  laid there perfectly still pretty soon we see something coming  stood up like  amazing wide wall  reached   desert up into  sky  hid  sun    coming like  nation too then  little faint breeze struck us  then  come harder  grains  sand begun  sift against our faces  sting like fire  tom sung out “its  sandstormturn your backs  it” we done it   another minute   blowing  gale   sand beat against us   shovelful   air  so thick   we couldnt see  thing in five minutes  boat  level full  we  setting   lockers buried up   chin  sand  only our heads out  could hardly breathe then  storm thinned  we see  monstrous wall go asailing off across  desert awful  look at i tell you we dug ourselves out  looked down  where  caravan  before there wasnt anything but just  sand ocean now  all still  quiet all them people  camels  smothered  dead  buriedburied under ten foot  sand we reckoned  tom allowed  might  years before  wind uncovered them  all  time their friends wouldnt ever know what become   caravan tom said “now we know what    happened   people we got  swords  pistols from” yes sir   just it it   plain  day now they got buried   sandstorm   wild animals couldnt get  them   wind never uncovered them again until they  dried  leather  warnt fit  eat it seemed  me we had felt  sorry  them poor people   person could  anybody   mournful too but we  mistaken this last caravans death went harder  us  good deal harder you see  others  total strangers  we never got  feeling acquainted  them  all except maybe  little   man   watching  girl but   different  this last caravan we  huvvering around them  whole night  most  whole day  had got  feeling real friendly  them  acquainted i have found out  there aint no surer way  find out whether you like people or hate them than  travel  them just so  these we kind  liked them   start  traveling  them put   finisher the longer we traveled  them   more we got used  their ways  better  better we liked them   gladder  gladder we   we run across them we had come  know some  them so well  we called them  name when we  talking about them  soon got so familiar  sociable  we even dropped  miss  mister  just used their plain names without any handle   did not seem unpolite but just  right thing of course  wasnt their own names but names we give them there  mr elexander robinson  miss adaline robinson  colonel jacob mcdougal  miss harryet mcdougal  judge jeremiah butler  young bushrod butler  these  big chiefs mostly  wore splendid great turbans  simmeters  dressed like  grand mogul  their families but  soon  we come  know them good  like them very much  warnt mister nor judge nor nothing any more but only elleck  addy  jake  hattie  jerry  buck  so on and you know  more you join   people  their joys  their sorrows  more nearer  dearer they come    you now we warnt cold  indifferent  way most travelers is we  right down friendly  sociable  took  chance  everything   going   caravan could depend  us    hand every time  didnt make no difference what  was when they camped we camped right over them ten or twelve hundred feet up   air when they et  meal we et ourn   made  ever so much homeliker  have their company when they had  wedding  night  buck  addy got married we got ourselves up   very starchiest   professors duds   blowout  when they danced we jined   shook  foot up there but   sorrow  trouble  brings you  nearest     funeral  done   us it  next morning just   still dawn we didnt know  diseased   warnt  our set but  never made no difference  belonged   caravan    enough  there warnt no more sincerer tears shed over him than  ones we dripped  him  up there eleven hundred foot  high yes parting  this caravan  much more bitterer than    part  them others which  comparative strangers  been dead so long anyway we had knowed these  their lives   fond  them too  now  have death snatch them  right before our faces while we  looking  leave us so lonesome  friendless   middle   big desert  did hurt so  we wished we mightnt ever make any more friends   voyage if we  going  lose them again like that we couldnt keep  talking about them  they  all  time coming up  our memory  looking just  way they looked when we  all alive  happy together we could see  line marching   shiny spearheads awinking   sun we could see  dromedaries lumbering along we could see  wedding   funeral  more oftener than anything else we could see them praying because they dont allow nothing  prevent that whenever  call come several times  day they would stop right there  stand up  face   east  lift back their heads  spread out their arms  begin  four or five times they would go down  their knees  then fall forward  touch their forehead   ground well  warnt good  go  talking about them lovely  they   their life  dear  us  their life  death both because  didnt do no good  made us too downhearted jim allowed   going  live  good  life   could so  could see them again   better world  tom kept still  didnt tell him they  only mohammedans  warnt no use  disappoint him   feeling bad enough just   was when we woke up next morning we  feeling  little cheerfuller  had had  most powerful good sleep because sand   comfortablest bed there is  i dont see why people  can afford  dont have  more and its terrible good ballast too i never see  balloon so steady before tom allowed we had twenty tons  it  wondered what we better do  it   good sand   didnt seem good sense  throw  away jim says “mars tom cant we tote  back home en sell it how longll  take” “depends   way we go” “well sah shes wuth  quarter   dollar  load  home en i reckon wes got  much  twenty loads haint we how much would dat be” “five dollars” “by jings mars tom les shove  home right  de spot hits moren  dollar en  half apiece haint it” “yes” “well ef dat aint makin money de easiest ever i struck she jes rained innever cos us  lick o work les mosey right along mars tom” but tom  thinking  ciphering away so busy  excited  never heard him pretty soon  says “five dollarssho look here this sands worthworthwhy its worth no end  money” “how  dat mars tom go on honey go on” “well  minute people knows its genuwyne sand   genuwyne desert  sahara theyll just    perfect state  mind  git hold  some    keep   whatnot   vial   label     curiosity all we got  do   put  up  vials  float around all over  united states  peddle them out  ten cents apiece weve got all  ten thousand dollars worth  sand  this boat” me  jim went all  pieces  joy  begun  shout whoopjamboreehoo  tom says “and we can keep  coming back  fetching sand  coming back  fetching more sand  just keep  agoing till weve carted this whole desert over there  sold  out  there aint ever going   any opposition either because well take out  patent” “my goodness” i says “well   rich  creosote wont we

worth” “well i dont know yet its got   ciphered   aint  easiest job  do either because its over four million square miles  sand  ten cents  vial” jim  awful excited but this faded  out considerable   shook his head  says “mars tom we cant ford all dem vialsa king couldnt we better not try  take de whole desert mars tom de vials gwyne  bust us sho” toms excitement died out too now  i reckoned    account   vials but  wasnt he set there thinking  got bluer  bluer   last  says “boys  wont work we got  give  up” “why tom” “on account   duties” i couldnt make nothing out  that neither could jim i says “what is our duty tom because if we cant git around it why cant we just do it people often  to” but  says “oh  aint  kind  duty the kind i mean   tax whenever you strike  frontierthats  border   country you knowyou find  customhouse there   govment officers comes  rummages among your things  charges  big tax which they call  duty because its their duty  bust you if they can  if you dont pay  duty theyll hog your sand they call  confiscating but  dont deceive nobody its just hogging  thats all  is now if we try  carry this sand home  way were pointed now we got  climb fences till we git tiredjust frontier after frontieregypt arabia hindostan  so on  theyll all whack   duty  so you see easy enough we cant go that road” “why tom” i says “we can sail right over their old frontiers how  they going  stop us” he looked sorrowful  me  says very grave “huck finn do you think  would  honest” i hate them kind  interruptions i never said nothing   went on “well were shut off  other way too if we go back  way weve come theres  new york customhouse    worse than all  them others put together  account   kind  cargo weve got” “why” “well they cant raise sahara sand  america  course  when they cant raise  thing there  duty  fourteen hundred thousand per cent   if you try  fetch    where they do raise it” “there aint no sense  that tom sawyer” “who said there was what do you talk  me like  for huck finn you wait till i say  things got sense   before you go  accusing me  saying it” “all right consider me crying about it  sorry go on” jim says “mars tom do dey jam dat duty onto everything we cant raise  america en dont make no stinction twix anything” “yes thats what they do” “mars tom aint de blessin o de lord de mos valuable thing dey is” “yes  is” “dont de preacher stan up  de pulpit en call  down  de people” “yes” “whah do  come from” “from heaven” “yassir yous jes right deed you is honeyit come  heaven en dats  foreign country now den do dey put  tax  dat blessin” “no they dont” “course dey dont en so  stan  reason dat yous mistaken mars tom dey wouldnt put de tax  po truck like san dat everybody aint bleeged  have en leave  offn de bes thing dey is which nobody cant git along widout” tom sawyer  stumped  see jim had got him where  couldnt budge he tried  wiggle out  saying they had forgot  put   tax but theyd  sure  remember about it next session  congress  then theyd put  on but    poor lame comeoff   knowed it he said there warnt nothing foreign  warnt taxed but just  one  so they couldnt  consistent without taxing it    consistent   first law  politics so  stuck    theyd left  out unintentional  would  certain  do their best  fix  before they got caught  laughed at but i didnt feel no more interest  such things  long  we couldnt git our sand through   made me lowspirited  jim  same tom  tried  cheer us up  saying  would think up another speculation  us  would  just  good  this one  better but  didnt do no good we didnt believe there  any  big  this it  mighty hard such  little while ago we  so rich  could a bought  country  started  kingdom  been celebrated  happy  now we  so poor  ornery again  had our sand left  our hands the sand  looking so lovely before just like gold  dimonds   feel    so soft  so silky  nice but now i couldnt bear  sight  it  made me sick  look  it  i knowed i wouldnt ever feel comfortable again till we got shut  it  i didnt have  there no more  remind us  what we had been  what we had got degraded down to the others  feeling  same way about   i was i knowed it because they cheered up so  minute i says les throw this truck overboard well   going   work you know  pretty solid work too so tom  divided  up according  fairness  strength he said me  him would clear out  fifth apiece   sand  jim threefifths jim  didnt quite like  arrangement he says “course is de stronges en is willin  do  share accordin but  jings yous kinder pilin  onto ole jim mars tom haint you” “well i didnt think so jim but you try your hand  fixing it  lets see” so jim reckoned  wouldnt  no more than fair if me  tom done  tenth apiece tom  turned his back  git room   private  then  smole  smile  spread around  covered  whole sahara   westward back   atlantic edge   where we come from then  turned around again  said    good enough arrangement  we  satisfied if jim was jim said  was so then tom measured off our twotenths   bow  left  rest  jim   surprised jim  good deal  see how much difference there   what  raging lot  sand his share come to  said   powerful glad now   had spoke up  time  got  first arrangement altered   said  even  way   now there  more sand than enjoyment  his end   contract  believed then we laid into it it  mighty hot work  tough so hot we had  move up into cooler weather or we couldnt a stood it me  tom took turn about  one worked while tother rested but there warnt nobody  spell poor old jim   made all  part  africa damp  sweated so we couldnt work good we  so full  laugh  jim  kept fretting  wanting  know what tickled us so  we had  keep making up things  account  it  they  pretty poor inventions but they done well enough jim didnt see through them at last when we got done we  most dead but not  work but  laughing by   jim  most dead too but    work then we took turns  spelled him     thankfull   could be  would set   gunnel  swab  sweat  heave  pant  say how good we    poor old nigger   wouldnt ever forgit us he  always  gratefulest nigger i ever see  any little thing you done  him he  only nigger outside inside    white  you be chapter xii jim standing siege the next few meals  pretty sandy but  dont make no difference when you  hungry  when you aint  aint no satisfaction  eat anyway  so  little grit   meat aint no particular drawback  far  i can see then we struck  east end   desert  last sailing   northeast course away off   edge   sand   soft pinky light we see three little sharp roofs like tents  tom says “its  pyramids  egypt” it made my heart fairly jump you see i had seen  many   many  picture  them  heard tell about them  hundred times  yet  come  them all   sudden  way  find they  real stead  imaginations most knocked  breath out  me  surprise its  curious thing   more you hear about  grand  big  bully thing or person  more  kind  dreamies out  you may say  gets    big dim wavery figger made out  moonshine  nothing solid  it its just so  george washington   same  them pyramids and moreover besides  thing they always said about them seemed  me   stretchers there   feller come   sundayschool once  had  picture  them  made  speech  said  biggest pyramid covered thirteen acres   most five hundred foot high just  steep mountain all built out  hunks  stone  big   bureau  laid up  perfectly regular layers like stairsteps thirteen acres you see  just one building its  farm if  hadnt been  sundayschool i would a judged    lie  outside i  certain  it and  said there   hole   pyramid  you could go  there  candles  go ever so far up  long slanting tunnel  come   large room   stomach   stone mountain  there you would find  big stone chest   king  it four thousand years old i said  myself then if  aint  lie i  eat  king if they  fetch him  even methusalem warnt  old  nobody claims it as we come  little nearer we see  yaller sand come   end   long straight edge like  blanket      joined edge  edge  wide country  bright green   snaky stripe crooking through it  tom said    nile it made my heart jump again   nile  another thing  wasnt real  me now i can tell you one thing which  dead certain if you  fool along over three thousand miles  yaller sand all glimmering  heat so   makes your eyes water  look  it  youve been  considerable part   week doing it  green country  look so like home  heaven  you    make your eyes water again it  just so  me   same  jim and when jim got so  could believe  was  land  egypt   looking at  wouldnt enter  standing up but got down  his knees  took off his hat because  said  wasnt fitten   humble poor nigger  come any other way where such men had been  moses  joseph  pharaoh   other prophets he   presbyterian  had  most deep respect  moses which   presbyterian too  said he  all stirred up  says “hits de lan  egypt de lan  egypt en is lowed  look   wid my own eyes en dahs de river dat  turn  blood en is looking  de very same groun whah de plagues was en de lice en de frogs en de locus en de hail en whah dey marked de doorpos en de angel o de lord come   de darkness o de night en slew de fustborn  all de lan o egypt ole jim aint worthy  see dis day” and then  just broke down  cried   so thankful so between him  tom there  talk enough jim being excited because  land  so full  historyjoseph  his brethren moses   bulrushers jacob coming down into egypt  buy corn  silver cup   sack  all them interesting things  tom just  excited too because  land  so full  history    his line about noureddin  bedreddin  such like monstrous giants  made jims wool rise   raft  other arabian nights folks which  half  them never done  things they let  they done i dont believe then we struck  disappointment  one  them early morning fogs started up   warnt no use  sail over  top  it because we would go  egypt sure so we judged   best  set her  compass straight   place where  pyramids  gitting blurred  blotted out  then drop low  skin along pretty close   ground  keep  sharp lookout tom took  hellum i stood   let go  anchor  jim  straddled  bow  dig through  fog  his eyes  watch out  danger ahead we went along  steady gait but not very fast   fog got solider  solider so solid  jim looked dim  ragged  smoky through it it  awful still  we talked low   anxious now  then jim would say “highst her  pint mars tom highst her”  up she would skip  foot or two  we would slide right over  flatroofed mud cabin  people  had been asleep   just beginning  turn out  gap  stretch  once when  feller  clear up  his hind legs so  could gap  stretch better we took him  blip   back  knocked him off by  by after about  hour  everything dead still  we astraining our ears  sounds  holding our breath  fog thinned  little very sudden  jim sung out   awful scare “oh  de lans sake set her back mars tom heres de biggest giant outen de rabian nights acomin  us”   went over backwards   boat tom slammed   backaction   we slowed   standstill  mans face  big  our house  home looked  over  gunnel same   house looks out   windows  i laid down  died i must a been clear dead  gone   much   minute or more then i come to  tom had hitched  boathook    lower lip   giant   holding  balloon steady   whilst  canted his head back  got  good long look up   awful face jim   his knees  his hands clasped gazing up   thing   begging way  working his lips but not getting anything out i took only just  glimpse   fading out again but tom says “he aint alive you fools its  sphinx” i never see tom look so little  like  fly but   because  giants head  so big  awful awful yes so  was but not dreadful any more because you could see    noble face  kind  sad  not thinking about you but about other things  larger it  stone reddish stone   nose  ears battered   give   abused look  you felt sorrier    that we stood off  piece  sailed around   over it    just grand it   mans head or maybe  womans   tigers body  hundred  twentyfive foot long  there   dear little temple between  front paws all but  head used   under  sand  hundreds  years maybe thousands but they had just lately dug  sand away  found  little temple it took  power  sand  bury  cretur most  much   would  bury  steamboat i reckon we landed jim  top   head   american flag  protect him  being  foreign land then we sailed off  this    tother distance  git what tom called effects  perspectives  proportions  jim  done  best  could striking all  different kinds  attitudes  positions  could study up but standing  his head  working his legs  way  frog does   best the further we got away  littler jim got   grander  sphinx got till  last   only  clothespin   dome  you might say thats  way perspective brings out  correct proportions tom said  said julus cesars niggers didnt know how big  was they  too close  him then we sailed off further  further till we couldnt see jim  all any more  then  great figger    noblest agazing out over  nile valley so still  solemn  lonesome  all  little shabby huts  things   scattered about  clean disappeared  gone  nothing around  now but  soft wide spread  yaller velvet which   sand that   right place  stop  we done it we set there alooking  athinking   half  hour nobody asaying anything   made us feel quiet  kind  solemn  remember  had been looking over  valley just  same way  thinking  awful thoughts all  itself  thousands  years  nobody cant find out what they   this day at last i took up  glass  see some little black things acapering around   velvet carpet  some more aclimbing up  creturs back  then i see two or three wee puffs  white smoke  told tom  look he done it  says “theyre bugs nohold on theywhy i believe theyre men yes its menmen  horses both theyre hauling  long ladder up onto  sphinxs backnow aint  odd and now theyre trying  lean  up atheres some more puffs  smokeits guns huck theyre after jim” we clapped   power  went  them abiling we  there  no time  come awhizzing down amongst them  they broke  scattered every which way  some   climbing  ladder after jim let go all holts  fell we soared up  found him laying  top   head panting  most tuckered out partly  howling  help  partly  scare he had been standing  siege  long timea week he said but  warnt so  only just seemed so  him because they  crowding him so they had shot  him  rained  bullets all around him but  warnt hit  when they found  wouldnt stand up   bullets couldnt git  him when   laying down they went   ladder  then  knowed   all up  him if we didnt come pretty quick tom  very indignant  asked him why  didnt show  flag  command them  git   name   united states jim said  done it but they never paid no attention tom said  would have this thing looked into  washington  says “youll see  theyll have  apologize  insulting  flag  pay  indemnity too  top   even if they git off that easy” jim says “whats  indemnity mars tom” “its cash thats what  is” “who gits it mars tom” “why we do” “en who gits de apology” “the united states or we can take whichever we please we can take  apology if we want to  let  govment take  money” “how much money   be mars tom” “well   aggravated case like this one     least three dollars apiece  i dont know but more” “well den well take de money mars tom blame de pology haint dat yo notion too en haint  yourn huck” we talked  over  little  allowed     good  way  any so we agreed  take  money it   new business  me  i asked tom if countries always apologized when they had done wrong   says “yes  little ones does” we  sailing around examining  pyramids you know  now we soared up  roosted   flat top   biggest one  found   just like what  man said   sundayschool it  like four pairs  stairs  starts broad   bottom  slants up  comes together   point   top only these stairsteps couldnt  clumb  way you climb other stairs no  each step   high  your chin  you have   boosted up  behind the two other pyramids warnt far away   people moving about   sand between looked like bugs crawling we  so high above them tom  couldnt hold himself   so worked up  gladness  astonishment    such  celebrated place   just dripped history  every pore seemed  me he said  couldnt scarcely believe   standing   very identical spot  prince flew    bronze horse it    arabian night times  said somebody give  prince  bronze horse   peg   shoulder   could git  him  fly through  air like  bird  go all over  world  steer   turning  peg  fly high or low  land wherever  wanted to when  got done telling  there  one  them uncomfortable silences  comes you know when  person  been telling  whopper  you feel sorry  him  wish you could think  some way  change  subject  let him down easy but git stuck  dont see no way  before you can pull your mind together  do something  silence  got   spread itself  done  business i  embarrassed jim   embarrassed  neither  us couldnt say  word well tom  glowered  me  minute  says “come out  it what do you think” i says “tom sawyer you dont believe that yourself” “whats  reason i dont whats  hender me” “theres one thing  hender you  couldnt happen thats all” “whats  reason  couldnt happen” “you tell me  reason  could happen” “this balloon   good

broke off surprised  says “looky here huck finn dont you see  yet” i says “tom sawyer i want  ask you some questions” “go ahead”  says  i see jim chirk up  listen “as i understand it  whole thing

huck aint got him agin hucks landed him high en dry dis time i tell you hits de smartes trap i ever see  body walk interen ef i” but jim  so full  laugh  got  strangling  couldnt go on  tom   mad  see how neat i had floored him  turned his own argument agin him  knocked him all  rags  flinders  it  all  could manage  say   whenever  heard me  jim try  argue  made him ashamed   human race i never said nothing i  feeling pretty well satisfied when i have got  best   person  way  aint my way  go around crowing about   way some people does  i consider  if i   his place i wouldnt wish him  crow over me its better   generous thats what i think chapter xiii going for toms pipe by and by we left jim  float around up there   neighborhood   pyramids  we clumb down   hole where you go into  tunnel  went   some arabs  candles  away  there   middle   pyramid we found  room   big stone box   where they used  keep  king just   man   sundayschool said but   gone now somebody had got him but i didnt take no interest   place because there could  ghosts there  course not fresh ones but i dont like no kind so then we come out  got some little donkeys  rode  piece  then went   boat another piece  then more donkeys  got  cairo  all  way  road   smooth  beautiful  road  ever i see  had tall datepams  both sides  naked children everywhere   men   red  copper  fine  strong  handsome and  city   curiosity such narrow streetswhy they  just lanes  crowded  people  turbans  women  veils  everybody rigged out  blazing bright clothes  all sorts  colors  you wondered how  camels   people got  each other  such narrow little cracks but they done ita perfect jam you see  everybody noisy the stores warnt big enough  turn around in but you didnt have  go in  storekeeper sat tailor fashion  his counter smoking his snaky long pipe  had his things where  could reach them  sell    just  good    street   camelloads brushed him  they went by now  then  grand person flew    carriage  fancy dressed men running  yelling  front    whacking anybody   long rod  didnt get out   way and    along comes  sultan riding horseback   head   procession  fairly took your breath away his clothes  so splendid  everybody fell flat  laid  his stomach while  went by i forgot but  feller helped me  remember he  one  had  rod  run  front there  churches but they dont know enough  keep sunday they keep friday  break  sabbath you have  take off your shoes when you go in there  crowds  men  boys   church setting  groups   stone floor  making no end  noisegetting their lessons  heart tom said out   koran which they think   bible  people  knows better knows enough  not let on i never see such  big church  my life before  most awful high  was  made you dizzy  look up our village church  home aint  circumstance  it if you   put   there people would think    drygoods box what i wanted  see   dervish because i  interested  dervishes  accounts   one  played  trick   cameldriver so we found  lot   kind   church  they called themselves whirling dervishes  they did whirl too i never see anything like it they had tall sugarloaf hats on  linen petticoats  they spun  spun  spun round  round like tops   petticoats stood out   slant     prettiest thing i ever see  made me drunk  look  it they  all moslems tom said  when i asked him what  moslem was  said    person  wasnt  presbyterian so there  plenty  them  missouri though i didnt know  before we didnt see half there   see  cairo because tom   such  sweat  hunt out places   celebrated  history we had  most tiresome time  find  granary where joseph stored up  grain before  famine  when we found   warnt worth much  look at being such  old tumbledown wreck but tom  satisfied  made more fuss over  than i would make if i stuck  nail  my foot how  ever found  place  too many  me we passed  much  forty just like  before we come  it  any  them would a done  me but none but just  right one would suit him i never see anybody so particular  tom sawyer the minute  struck  right one  reconnized   easy  i would reconnize my other shirt if i had one but how  done   couldnt any more tell than  could fly  said so himself then we hunted  long time   house where  boy lived  learned  cadi how  try  case   old olives   new ones  said   out   arabian nights   would tell me  jim about  when  got time well we hunted  hunted till i  ready  drop  i wanted tom  give  up  come next day  git somebody  knowed  town  could talk missourian  could go straight   place but no  wanted  find  himself  nothing else would answer so  we went then  last  remarkablest thing happened i ever see the house  gonegone hundreds  years agoevery last rag   gone but just one mud brick now  person wouldnt ever believe   backwoods missouri boy  hadnt ever been   town before could go  hunt  place over  find  brick but tom sawyer done it i know  done it because i see him do it i  right  his very side   time  see him see  brick  see him reconnize it well i says  myself how does  do it is  knowledge or   instink now theres  facts just  they happened let everybody explain  their own way ive ciphered over   good deal  its my opinion  some    knowledge but  main bulk    instink the reason  this tom put  brick  his pocket  give   museum  his name     facts when  went home  i slipped  out  put another brick considerable like    place   didnt know  differencebut there   difference you see i think  settles itits mostly instink not knowledge instink tells him where  exact place    brick   in  so  reconnizes    place its in not   look   brick if   knowledge not instink  would know  brick again   look    next time  seen itwhich  didnt so  shows   all  brag you hear about knowledge being such  wonderful thing instink  worth forty    real unerringness jim says  same when we got back jim dropped down  took us in  there   young man there   red skullcap  tassel    beautiful silk jacket  baggy trousers   shawl around his waist  pistols    could talk english  wanted  hire  us  guide  take us  mecca  medina  central africa  everywheres   half  dollar  day  his keep  we hired him  left  piled   power    time we  through dinner we  over  place where  israelites crossed  red sea when pharaoh tried  overtake them   caught   waters we stopped then  had  good look   place   done jim good  see it he said  could see  all now just  way  happened  could see  israelites walking along between  walls  water   egyptians coming  away off yonder hurrying all they could  see them start    israelites went out  then when they  all in see  walls tumble together  drown  last man  them then we piled   power again  rushed away  huvvered over mount sinai  saw  place where moses broke  tables  stone  where  children  israel camped   plain  worshiped  golden calf    all just  interesting  could be   guide knowed every place  well  i knowed  village  home but we had  accident now   fetched all  plans   standstill toms old ornery corncob pipe had got so old  swelled  warped  she couldnt hold together any longer notwithstanding  strings  bandages but caved   went  pieces tom  didnt know what  do the professors pipe wouldnt answer  warnt anything but  mershum   person thats got used   cob pipe knows  lays  long ways over all  other pipes  this world  you cant git him  smoke any other he wouldnt take mine i couldnt persuade him so there  was he thought  over  said we must scour around  see if we could roust out one  egypt or arabia or around  some  these countries but  guide said no  warnt no use they didnt have them so tom  pretty glum   little while then  chirked up  said hed got  idea  knowed what  do he says “ive got another corncob pipe  its  prime one too  nearly new its laying   rafter thats right over  kitchen stove  home   village jim you   guide  go  get it  me  huck  camp here  mount sinai till you come back” “but mars tom we couldnt ever find de village i could find de pipe case i knows de kitchen but my lan we cant ever find de village nur sent louis nur none o dem places we dont know de way mars tom” that   fact   stumped tom   minute then  said “looky here  can  done sure  ill tell you how you set your compass  sail west  straight   dart till you find  united states it aint any trouble because its  first land youll strike  other side   atlantic if its daytime when you strike it bulge right on straight west   upper part   florida coast    hour  three quarters youll hit  mouth   mississippiat  speed  im going  send you youll  so high up   air   earth   curved considerablesorter like  washbowl turned upside

quarters till you see  ohio come in then you want  look sharp because youre getting near away up  your left youll see another thread coming inthats  missouri    little above st louis youll come down

mars tom i reckon we kin do ityassir i knows we kin” the guide  sure  it too  thought   could learn  stand his watch   little while “jim can learn you  whole thing   half  hour” tom said “this balloons  easy  manage   canoe” tom got out  chart  marked out  course  measured it  says “to go back west   shortest way you see its only about seven thousand miles if you went east  so  around its over twice  far” then  says   guide “i want you both  watch  telltale all through  watches  whenever  dont mark three hundred miles  hour you go higher or drop lower till you find  stormcurrent thats going your way theres  hundred miles  hour  this old thing without any wind  help theres twohundredmile gales   found any time you want  hunt  them” “well hunt  them sir” “see  you do sometimes you

 these latitudes  they travel low too” then  ciphered   time  says “seven thousand miles three hundred miles  houryou can make  trip   daytwentyfour hours this  thursday youll  back here saturday afternoon come now hustle out some blankets  food  books  things  me  huck  you can start right along there aint no occasion  fool aroundi want  smoke   quicker you fetch  pipe  better” all hands jumped   things   eight minutes our things  out   balloon  ready  america so we shook hands goodbye  tom gave his last orders “its  minutes   pm now mount sinai time in  hours youll  home  itll

hours arriving   or  pm mount sinai time” tom  read  piece  paper  us he had wrote  it “thursday afternoon tom sawyer  erronort sends his love  aunt polly  mount sinai where  ark was  so does huck finn  she  get  tomorrow morning halfpast six”   this misplacing   ark  probably hucks error not tomsmt “thatll make her eyes bulge out   tears come”  says then  says “stand by onetwothreeaway you go” and away she did go why she seemed  whiz out  sight   second then we found  most comfortable cave  looked out over  whole big plain  there we camped  wait   pipe the balloon come back all right  brung  pipe but aunt polly had catched jim when   getting it  anybody can guess what happened she sent  tom so jim  says “mars tom shes out  de porch wid her eye sot  de sky alayin  you en she say she aint gwyne  budge  dah tell she gits hold  you deys gwyne   trouble mars tom deed dey is” so then we shoved  home  not feeling very gay neither end end  project gutenbergs tom sawyer abroad  mark twain
