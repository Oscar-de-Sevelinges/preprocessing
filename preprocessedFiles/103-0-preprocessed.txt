detective dogmatically “great robbers always resemble honest folks fellows who have rascally faces have only one course  take     remain honest otherwise they would  arrested offhand the artistic

detective passed down  quay  rapidly made his way   consul’s office where    once admitted   presence   official “consul” said he without preamble “i have strong reasons  believing  my man   passenger   ‘mongolia’” and  narrated what had just passed concerning  passport “well mr fix” replied  consul “i shall not  sorry  see  rascal’s face but perhaps  won’t come here—that is if    person you suppose him  be a robber doesn’t quite like  leave traces  his flight behind him and besides   not obliged  have his passport countersigned” “if    shrewd  i think  is consul   come” “to have his

“he is  frenchman named passepartout” “you   london” “yes” “and you  going—” “to bombay” “very good sir you know   visa  useless   no passport  required” “i know it sir” replied phileas fogg “but i wish  prove  your visa  i came  suez” “very well sir” the consul proceeded  sign  date  passport after which  added his official seal mr fogg paid  customary fee coldly bowed  went out followed  his servant “well” queried  detective “well  looks  acts like  perfectly honest man” replied  consul “possibly but   not  question do you think consul  this phlegmatic gentleman resembles feature  feature  robber whose description i have received” “i concede that but then you know all descriptions—” “i’ll make certain  it” interrupted fix “the servant seems  me less mysterious than  master besides he’s  frenchman  can’t help talking excuse me   little while consul” fix started off  search  passepartout meanwhile mr fogg after leaving  consulate repaired   quay gave some orders  passepartout went off

observed   had  yet neither gained nor lost he sat down quietly  breakfast  his cabin never once thinking  inspecting  town being one  those englishmen who  wont  see foreign countries through  eyes  their domestics chapter viii in which passepartout talks rather more perhaps than is prudent fix soon rejoined passepartout who  lounging  looking about   quay  if  did not feel  he  least  obliged not  see anything “well my friend” said  detective coming up  him “is your passport visaed” “ah it’s you  it monsieur” responded passepartout “thanks yes  passport  all right” “and you  looking about you” “yes but we travel so fast  i seem   journeying   dream so this  suez” “yes” “in egypt” “certainly  egypt” “and  africa” “in africa” “in africa” repeated passepartout “just think monsieur i had no idea  we should go farther than paris  all  i saw  paris  between twenty minutes past seven  twenty minutes before nine   morning between  northern   lyons stations through  windows   car    driving rain how i regret not having seen once more père la chaise   circus   champs elysées” “you    great hurry then” “i am not but my master is by  way i must buy some shoes  shirts we came away without trunks only   carpetbag” “i  show you  excellent shop  getting what you want” “really monsieur you  very kind” and they walked off together passepartout chatting volubly  they went along “above all” said he “don’t let me lose  steamer” “you have plenty  time it’s only twelve o’clock” passepartout pulled out his big watch “twelve”  exclaimed “why it’s only eight minutes before ten” “your watch  slow” “my watch a family watch monsieur which  come down  my greatgrandfather it doesn’t vary five minutes   year it’s  perfect chronometer look you” “i see how  is” said fix “you have kept london time which  two hours behind   suez you ought  regulate your watch  noon  each country” “i regulate my watch never” “well then   not agree   sun” “so much  worse   sun monsieur the sun   wrong then” and  worthy fellow returned  watch   fob   defiant gesture after  few minutes silence fix resumed “you left london hastily then” “i rather think so last friday  eight o’clock   evening monsieur fogg came home  his club  threequarters   hour afterwards we  off” “but where  your master going” “always straight ahead he  going round  world” “round  world” cried fix “yes   eighty days he says     wager but between us i don’t believe  word  it that wouldn’t  common sense there’s something else   wind” “ah mr fogg   character  he” “i should say  was” “is  rich” “no doubt    carrying  enormous sum  brand new banknotes  him and  doesn’t spare  money   way either   offered  large reward   engineer   ‘mongolia’ if  gets us  bombay well  advance  time” “and you have known your master  long time” “why no i entered his service  very day we left london” the effect  these replies upon  already suspicious  excited detective may  imagined the hasty departure  london soon after  robbery  large sum carried  mr fogg his eagerness  reach distant countries  pretext   eccentric  foolhardy bet—all confirmed fix  his theory he continued  pump poor passepartout  learned   really knew little or nothing  his master who lived  solitary existence  london  said   rich though no one knew whence came his riches   mysterious  impenetrable  his affairs  habits fix felt sure  phileas fogg would not land  suez but  really going   bombay “is bombay far  here” asked passepartout “pretty far it   ten days’ voyage  sea” “and  what country  bombay” “india” “in asia” “certainly” “the deuce i  going  tell you there’s one thing  worries me—my burner” “what burner” “my gasburner which i forgot  turn off  which   this moment burning  my expense i have calculated monsieur  i lose two shillings every four  twenty hours exactly sixpence more than i earn  you  understand   longer our journey—” did fix pay any attention  passepartout’s trouble about  gas it  not probable he  not listening but  cogitating  project passepartout   had now reached  shop where fix left his companion  make his purchases after recommending him not  miss  steamer  hurried back   consulate now    fully convinced fix had quite recovered his equanimity “consul” said he “i have no longer any doubt i have spotted my man he passes himself off   odd stick who  going round  world  eighty days” “then he’s  sharp fellow” returned  consul “and counts  returning  london after putting  police   two countries off his track” “we’ll see about that” replied fix “but  you not mistaken” “i am not mistaken” “why  this robber so anxious  prove   visa   had passed through suez” “why i have no idea but listen  me” he reported   few words  most important parts  his conversation  passepartout “in short” said  consul “appearances  wholly against this man and what  you going  do” “send  dispatch  london   warrant  arrest   dispatched instantly  bombay take passage  board  ‘mongolia’ follow my rogue  india  there  english ground arrest him politely  my warrant  my hand  my hand  his shoulder” having uttered these words   cool careless air  detective took leave   consul  repaired   telegraph office whence  sent  dispatch which

corrected passepartout’s time whereupon  latter made  same remark   had done  fix  upon  general insisting   watch should  regulated  each new meridian since   constantly going eastward     face   sun  therefore  days  shorter  four minutes  each degree gone over passepartout obstinately refused  alter his watch which  kept  london time it   innocent delusion which could harm no one the train stopped  eight o’clock   midst   glade some fifteen miles beyond rothal where there  several bungalows  workmen’s cabins the conductor passing along  carriages shouted “passengers  get out here” phileas fogg looked  sir francis cromarty   explanation but  general could not tell what meant  halt   midst  this forest  dates  acacias passepartout not less surprised rushed out  speedily returned crying “monsieur no more railway” “what do you mean” asked sir francis “i mean  say   train isn’t going on” the general  once stepped out while phileas fogg calmly followed him  they proceeded together   conductor “where  we” asked sir francis “at  hamlet  kholby” “do we stop here” “certainly the railway isn’t finished” “what not finished” “no there’s still  matter  fifty miles   laid  here  allahabad where  line begins again” “but  papers announced  opening   railway throughout” “what would you have officer the papers  mistaken” “yet you sell tickets  bombay  calcutta” retorted sir

what not mr fogg  sir francis cromarty after searching  village  end  end came back without having found anything “i shall go afoot” said phileas fogg passepartout who had now rejoined his master made  wry grimace   thought  his magnificent but too frail indian shoes happily  too had been looking about him and after  moment’s hesitation said “monsieur i think i have found  means  conveyance” “what” “an elephant an elephant  belongs   indian who lives but  hundred steps  here” “let’s go  see  elephant” replied mr fogg they soon reached  small hut near which enclosed within some high palings   animal  question an indian came out   hut and  their request conducted them within  enclosure the elephant which  owner had reared not   beast  burden but  warlike purposes  half domesticated the indian had begun already  often irritating him  feeding him every three months  sugar  butter  impart  him  ferocity not  his nature this method being often employed  those who train  indian elephants  battle happily however  mr fogg  animal’s instruction  this direction had not gone far   elephant still preserved his natural gentleness kiouni—this   name   beast—could doubtless travel rapidly   long time and  default  any other means  conveyance mr fogg resolved  hire him but elephants  far  cheap  india where they  becoming scarce  males which alone  suitable  circus shows  much sought especially  but few  them  domesticated when therefore mr fogg proposed   indian  hire kiouni  refused pointblank mr fogg persisted offering  excessive sum  ten pounds  hour   loan   beast  allahabad refused twenty pounds refused also forty pounds still refused passepartout jumped  each advance but  indian declined   tempted yet  offer   alluring one for supposing  took  elephant fifteen hours  reach allahabad his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling phileas fogg without getting   least flurried then proposed  purchase  animal outright   first offered  thousand pounds  him the indian perhaps thinking   going  make  great bargain still refused sir francis cromarty took mr fogg aside  begged him  reflect before  went any further  which  gentleman replied    not   habit  acting rashly   bet  twenty thousand pounds   stake   elephant  absolutely necessary  him    would secure him if  had  pay twenty times his value returning   indian whose small sharp eyes glistening  avarice betrayed   him   only  question  how great  price  could obtain mr fogg offered first twelve hundred then fifteen hundred eighteen hundred two thousand pounds passepartout usually so rubicund  fairly white  suspense at two thousand pounds  indian yielded “what  price good heavens” cried passepartout “for  elephant” it only remained now  find  guide which  comparatively easy a young parsee   intelligent face offered his services which mr fogg accepted promising so generous  reward   materially stimulate his zeal the elephant  led out  equipped the parsee who   accomplished elephant driver covered his back   sort  saddlecloth  attached  each  his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs phileas fogg paid  indian  some banknotes which  extracted   famous carpetbag  proceeding  seemed  deprive poor passepartout  his vitals then  offered  carry sir francis  allahabad which  brigadier gratefully accepted  one traveller  more would not  likely  fatigue  gigantic beast provisions  purchased  kholby and while sir francis  mr fogg took  howdahs  either side passepartout got astride  saddlecloth between them the parsee perched himself   elephant’s neck   nine

passepartout who  mounted   beast’s back  received  direct force  each concussion   trod along   very careful  accordance  his master’s advice  keep his tongue  between his teeth   would otherwise have been bitten off short the worthy fellow bounced   elephant’s neck  his rump  vaulted like  clown   springboard yet  laughed   midst  his bouncing   time  time took  piece  sugar out  his pocket  inserted   kiouni’s trunk who received  without   least slackening his regular trot after two hours  guide stopped  elephant  gave him  hour  rest during which kiouni after quenching his thirst   neighbouring spring set  devouring  branches  shrubs round about him neither sir francis nor mr fogg regretted  delay  both descended   feeling  relief “why he’s made  iron” exclaimed  general gazing admiringly  kiouni “of forged iron” replied passepartout   set about preparing  hasty breakfast at noon  parsee gave  signal  departure the country soon presented  very savage aspect copses  dates

population hardened   most horrible practices   hindoo faith the english have not been able  secure complete dominion over this territory which  subjected   influence  rajahs whom   almost impossible  reach  their inaccessible mountain fastnesses the travellers several times saw bands  ferocious indians who when they perceived  elephant striding acrosscountry made angry  threatening motions the parsee avoided them  much  possible few animals  observed   route even  monkeys hurried  their path  contortions  grimaces which convulsed passepartout  laughter in  midst  his gaiety however one thought troubled  worthy servant what would mr fogg do   elephant when  got  allahabad would  carry him   him impossible the cost  transporting him would make him ruinously expensive would  sell him or set him free the estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration should mr fogg choose  make him passepartout  present  kiouni  would  very much embarrassed  these thoughts did not cease worrying him   long time the principal chain   vindhias  crossed  eight   evening  another halt  made   northern slope   ruined bungalow they had gone nearly twentyfive miles  day   equal distance

amply partaken   appreciated at two o’clock  guide entered  thick forest which extended several miles  preferred  travel under cover   woods they had not  yet had any unpleasant encounters   journey seemed   point  being successfully accomplished when  elephant becoming restless suddenly stopped it  then four o’clock “what’s  matter” asked sir francis putting out his head “i don’t know officer” replied  parsee listening attentively   confused murmur which came through  thick branches the murmur soon became more distinct  now seemed like  distant concert  human voices accompanied  brass instruments passepartout  all eyes  ears mr fogg patiently waited without  word the parsee jumped   ground fastened  elephant   tree  plunged into  thicket he soon returned saying “a procession  brahmins  coming this way we must prevent their seeing us if possible” the guide unloosed  elephant  led him into  thicket   same time asking  travellers not  stir he held himself ready  bestride  animal   moment’s notice should flight become necessary but  evidently thought   procession   faithful would pass without perceiving them amid  thick foliage  which they  wholly concealed the discordant tones   voices  instruments drew nearer  now droning songs mingled   sound   tambourines  cymbals the head   procession soon appeared beneath  trees  hundred paces away   strange figures who performed  religious ceremony  easily distinguished through  branches first came  priests  mitres  their heads  clothed  long lace robes they  surrounded  men women  children who sang  kind  lugubrious psalm interrupted  regular intervals   tambourines  cymbals while behind them  drawn  car  large wheels  spokes  which represented serpents entwined  each other upon  car which  drawn  four richly caparisoned zebus stood  hideous statue  four arms  body coloured  dull red  haggard eyes dishevelled hair protruding tongue  lips tinted  betel it stood upright upon  figure   prostrate  headless giant sir francis recognising  statue whispered “the goddess kali  goddess  love  death” “of death perhaps” muttered back passepartout “but  love—that ugly old hag never” the parsee made  motion  keep silence a group  old fakirs  capering  making  wild ado round  statue these  striped  ochre  covered  cuts whence their blood issued drop  drop—stupid fanatics who   great indian ceremonies still throw themselves under  wheels  juggernaut some brahmins clad  all  sumptuousness  oriental apparel  leading  woman who faltered  every step followed this woman  young   fair   european her head  neck shoulders ears arms hands  toes  loaded down  jewels  gems  bracelets earrings  rings while  tunic bordered  gold  covered   light muslin robe betrayed  outline  her form the guards who followed  young woman presented  violent contrast  her armed  they   naked sabres hung  their waists  long damascened pistols  bearing  corpse   palanquin it   body   old man gorgeously arrayed   habiliments   rajah wearing   life  turban embroidered  pearls  robe  tissue  silk  gold  scarf  cashmere sewed  diamonds   magnificent weapons   hindoo prince next came  musicians   rearguard  capering fakirs whose cries sometimes drowned  noise   instruments these closed  procession sir francis watched  procession   sad countenance and turning   guide said “a suttee” the parsee nodded  put his finger  his lips the procession slowly wound under  trees  soon  last ranks disappeared   depths   wood the songs gradually died away occasionally cries  heard   distance until  last all  silence again phileas fogg had heard what sir francis said and  soon   procession had disappeared asked “what   suttee” “a suttee” returned  general “is  human sacrifice but  voluntary one the woman you have just seen   burned tomorrow   dawn  day” “oh  scoundrels” cried passepartout who could not repress his indignation “and  corpse” asked mr fogg “is    prince her husband” said  guide “an independent rajah  bundelcund” “is  possible” resumed phileas fogg his voice betraying not  least emotion “that these barbarous customs still exist  india    english have been unable  put  stop  them” “these sacrifices do not occur   larger portion  india” replied sir francis “but we have no power over these savage territories  especially here  bundelcund the whole district north   vindhias   theatre  incessant murders  pillage” “the poor wretch” exclaimed passepartout “to  burned alive” “yes” returned sir francis “burned alive and if she  not you cannot conceive what treatment she would  obliged  submit   her relatives they would shave off her hair feed her   scanty allowance  rice treat her  contempt she would  looked upon   unclean creature  would die  some corner like  scurvy dog the prospect  so frightful  existence drives these poor creatures   sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism sometimes however  sacrifice  really voluntary   requires  active interference   government  prevent it several years ago when i  living  bombay  young widow asked permission   governor   burned along  her husband’s body but  you may imagine  refused the woman left  town took refuge   independent rajah  there carried out her selfdevoted purpose” while sir francis  speaking  guide shook his head several times  now said “the sacrifice which  take place tomorrow  dawn  not  voluntary one” “how do you know” “everybody knows about this affair  bundelcund” “but  wretched creature did not seem   making any resistance” observed sir francis “that  because they had intoxicated her  fumes  hemp  opium” “but where  they taking her” “to  pagoda  pillaji two miles  here she  pass  night there” “and  sacrifice  take place—” “tomorrow   first light  dawn” the guide now led  elephant out   thicket  leaped upon his neck just   moment    about  urge kiouni forward   peculiar whistle mr fogg stopped him and turning  sir francis cromarty said “suppose we save this woman” “save  woman mr fogg” “i have yet twelve hours  spare i can devote them  that” “why you   man  heart” “sometimes” replied phileas fogg quietly “when i have  time” chapter xiii in which passepartout receives a new proof that fortune favors the brave the project   bold one full  difficulty perhaps impracticable mr fogg  going  risk life or  least liberty  therefore  success  his tour but  did not hesitate   found  sir francis cromarty  enthusiastic ally as  passepartout   ready  anything  might  proposed his master’s idea charmed him  perceived  heart  soul under  icy exterior he began  love phileas fogg there remained  guide what course would  adopt would  not take part   indians in default  his assistance   necessary   assured  his neutrality sir francis frankly put  question  him “officers” replied  guide “i am  parsee  this woman   parsee command me  you will” “excellent” said mr fogg “however” resumed  guide “it  certain not only  we shall risk our lives but horrible tortures if we  taken” “that  foreseen” replied mr fogg “i think we must wait till night before acting” “i think so” said  guide the worthy indian then gave some account   victim who  said   celebrated beauty   parsee race   daughter   wealthy bombay merchant she had received  thoroughly english education   city and  her manners  intelligence would  thought  european her name  aouda left  orphan she  married against her    old rajah  bundelcund and knowing  fate  awaited her she escaped  retaken  devoted   rajah’s relatives who had  interest  her death   sacrifice  which  seemed she could not escape the parsee’s narrative only confirmed mr fogg  his companions  their generous design it  decided   guide should direct  elephant towards  pagoda  pillaji which  accordingly approached  quickly  possible they halted half  hour afterwards   copse some five hundred feet   pagoda where they  well concealed but they could hear  groans  cries   fakirs distinctly they then discussed  means  getting   victim the guide  familiar   pagoda  pillaji  which   declared  young woman  imprisoned could they enter any   doors while  whole party  indians  plunged   drunken sleep or   safer  attempt  make  hole   walls this could only  determined   moment   place themselves but   certain   abduction must  made  night  not when  break  day  victim  led  her funeral pyre then no human intervention could save her as soon  night fell about six o’clock they decided  make  reconnaissance around  pagoda the cries   fakirs  just ceasing  indians    act  plunging themselves into  drunkenness caused  liquid opium mingled  hemp   might  possible  slip between them   temple itself the parsee leading  others noiselessly crept through  wood   ten minutes they found themselves

deepening dusk stood  hundred steps away “come” whispered  guide he slipped more cautiously than ever through  brush followed  his companions  silence around  only broken   low murmuring   wind among  branches soon  parsee stopped   borders   glade which  lit up   torches the ground  covered  groups   indians motionless  their drunken sleep  seemed  battlefield strewn   dead men women  children lay together in  background among  trees  pagoda  pillaji loomed distinctly much   guide’s disappointment  guards   rajah lighted  torches  watching   doors  marching   fro  naked sabres probably  priests too  watching within the parsee now convinced    impossible  force  entrance   temple advanced no farther but led his companions back again phileas fogg  sir francis cromarty also saw  nothing could

tree  waited the time seemed long  guide ever  anon left them  take  observation   edge   wood but  guards watched steadily   glare   torches   dim light crept through  windows   pagoda they waited till midnight but no change took place among  guards   became apparent  their yielding  sleep could not  counted on the other plan must  carried out  opening   walls   pagoda must  made it remained  ascertain whether  priests  watching   side  their victim  assiduously    soldiers   door after  last consultation  guide announced    ready   attempt  advanced followed   others they took  roundabout way so   get   pagoda   rear they reached  walls about halfpast twelve without having met anyone here there  no guard nor  there either windows or doors the night  dark the moon   wane scarcely left

passepartout   guide stopped had they been heard was  alarm being given common prudence urged them  retire  they did so followed  phileas fogg  sir francis they again hid themselves   wood  waited till  disturbance whatever  might be ceased holding themselves ready  resume their attempt without delay but awkwardly enough  guards now appeared   rear   temple  there installed themselves  readiness  prevent  surprise it would  difficult  describe  disappointment   party thus interrupted  their work they could not now reach  victim how then could they save her sir francis shook his fists passepartout  beside himself   guide gnashed his teeth  rage the tranquil fogg waited without betraying any emotion “we have nothing  do but  go away” whispered sir francis “nothing but  go away” echoed  guide “stop” said fogg “i am only due  allahabad tomorrow before noon” “but what can you hope  do” asked sir francis “in  few hours    daylight and—” “the chance which now seems lost may present itself   last moment” sir francis would have liked  read phileas fogg’s eyes what  this cool englishman thinking of was  planning  make  rush   young woman   very moment   sacrifice  boldly snatch her  her executioners this would  utter folly    hard  admit  fogg  such  fool sir francis consented however  remain   end  this terrible drama the guide led them   rear   glade where they  able  observe  sleeping groups meanwhile passepartout who had perched himself   lower branches   tree  resolving  idea which had  first struck him like  flash  which  now firmly lodged  his brain he had commenced  saying  himself “what folly”  then  repeated “why not after all it’s  chance—perhaps  only one   such sots” thinking thus  slipped   suppleness   serpent   lowest branches  ends  which

striving  escape  her executioner sir francis’s heart throbbed and convulsively seizing mr fogg’s hand found    open knife just  this moment  crowd began  move the young woman had again fallen into  stupor caused   fumes  hemp  passed among  fakirs who escorted her  their wild religious cries phileas fogg  his companions mingling   rear ranks   crowd followed   two minutes they reached  banks   stream  stopped fifty paces   pyre upon which still lay  rajah’s corpse in  semiobscurity they saw  victim quite senseless stretched out beside her husband’s body then  torch  brought   wood heavily soaked  oil instantly took fire at this moment sir francis   guide seized phileas fogg who   instant  mad generosity  about  rush upon  pyre but  had quickly pushed them aside when  whole scene suddenly changed a cry  terror arose the whole multitude prostrated themselves terrorstricken   ground the old rajah  not dead then since  rose   sudden like  spectre took up his wife  his arms  descended   pyre   midst   clouds  smoke which only heightened his ghostly appearance fakirs  soldiers  priests seized  instant terror lay there  their faces   ground not daring  lift their eyes  behold such  prodigy the inanimate victim  borne along   vigorous arms which supported her  which she did not seem   least  burden mr fogg  sir francis stood erect  parsee bowed his head  passepartout was no doubt scarcely less stupefied the resuscitated rajah approached sir francis  mr fogg and   abrupt tone said “let us  off” it  passepartout himself who had slipped upon  pyre   midst   smoke and profiting   still overhanging darkness had delivered  young woman  death it  passepartout who playing his part   happy audacity had passed through  crowd amid  general terror a moment after all four   party had disappeared   woods   elephant  bearing them away   rapid pace but  cries  noise   ball which whizzed through phileas fogg’s hat apprised them   trick had been discovered the old rajah’s body indeed now appeared upon  burning pyre   priests recovered  their terror perceived   abduction had taken place they hastened into  forest followed   soldiers who fired  volley after  fugitives but  latter rapidly increased  distance between them  ere long found themselves beyond  reach   bullets  arrows chapter xiv in which phileas fogg descends the whole length of the beautiful valley of

given her some hints  his master’s eccentricity  made her smile  telling her   wager which  sending him round  world after all she owed phileas fogg her life  she always regarded him through  exalting

him still  bombay but necessity impelled him nevertheless  renew his acquaintance   worthy servant    seen all  detective’s hopes  wishes  now centred  hong kong   steamer’s stay  singapore would  too brief  enable him  take any steps there the arrest must  made  hong kong or  robber would probably escape him  ever hong kong   last english ground  which  would set foot beyond china japan america offered  fogg  almost certain refuge if  warrant should  last make  appearance  hong kong fix could arrest him  give him into  hands   local police  there would  no further trouble but beyond hong kong  simple warrant would   no avail  extradition warrant would  necessary   would result  delays  obstacles  which  rascal would take advantage  elude justice fix thought over these probabilities during  long hours which  spent  his cabin  kept repeating  himself “now either  warrant    hong kong  which case i shall arrest my man or   not  there  this time   absolutely necessary  i should delay his departure i have failed  bombay  i have failed  calcutta if i fail  hong kong my reputation  lost cost what  may i must succeed but how shall i prevent his departure if  should turn out   my last resource” fix made up his mind that if worst came  worst  would make  confidant  passepartout  tell him what kind   fellow his master really was that passepartout  not fogg’s accomplice   very certain the servant enlightened  his disclosure  afraid  being himself implicated   crime would doubtless become  ally   detective but this method   dangerous one only   employed when everything else had failed a word  passepartout  his master would ruin all the detective  therefore   sore strait but suddenly  new idea struck him the presence  aouda   “rangoon”  company  phileas fogg gave him new material  reflection who  this woman what combination  events had made her fogg’s travelling companion they had evidently met somewhere between bombay  calcutta but where had they met accidentally or had fogg gone into  interior purposely  quest  this charming damsel fix  fairly puzzled he asked himself whether there had not been  wicked elopement  this idea so impressed itself upon his mind   determined  make use   supposed intrigue whether  young woman  married or not  would  able  create such difficulties  mr fogg  hong kong   could not escape  paying any amount  money but could  even wait till they reached hong kong fogg had  abominable way  jumping  one boat  another and before anything could  effected might get full under way again  yokohama fix decided   must warn  english authorities  signal  “rangoon” before her arrival this  easy  do since  steamer stopped  singapore whence there   telegraphic wire  hong kong he finally resolved moreover before acting more positively  question passepartout it would not  difficult  make him talk and  there  no time  lose fix prepared  make himself known it  now  th  october    following day  “rangoon”  due  singapore fix emerged  his cabin  went  deck passepartout  promenading up  down   forward part   steamer the detective rushed forward  every appearance  extreme surprise  exclaimed “you here   ‘rangoon’” “what monsieur fix

shall stop  hong kong—at least  some days” “hum” said passepartout who seemed   instant perplexed “but how   i have not seen you  board since we left calcutta” “oh  trifle  seasickness—i’ve been

voyage from singapore to hong kong the detective  passepartout met often  deck after this interview though fix  reserved  did not attempt  induce his companion  divulge any more facts concerning mr fogg he caught  glimpse   mysterious gentleman once or twice but mr fogg usually confined himself   cabin where  kept aouda company or according  his inveterate habit took  hand  whist passepartout began very seriously  conjecture what strange chance kept fix still   route  his master  pursuing it  really worth considering why this certainly very amiable  complacent person whom  had first met

object passepartout  ready  wager his indian shoes—which  religiously preserved—that fix would also leave hong kong   same time  them  probably   same steamer passepartout might have cudgelled his brain   century without hitting upon  real object which  detective had  view he never could have imagined  phileas fogg  being tracked   robber around  globe but     human nature  attempt  solution

“you believe  this journey around  world then” “absolutely don’t you mr fix” “i i don’t believe  word  it” “you’re  sly dog” said passepartout winking  him this expression rather disturbed fix without his knowing why had  frenchman guessed his real purpose he knew not what  think but how could passepartout have discovered     detective yet  speaking   did  man evidently meant more than  expressed passepartout went still further  next day  could not hold his tongue “mr fix” said he   bantering tone “shall we  so unfortunate   lose you when we get  hong kong” “why” responded fix  little

passepartout  this looked attentively  his companion fix’s face seemed  have  singular expression he resumed his seat “what    you have  say” fix placed his hand upon passepartout’s arm and lowering his voice said “you have guessed who i am” “parbleu” said passepartout smiling “then i’m going  tell you everything—” “now  i know everything my friend ah that’s very good but go on go on first though let me tell you  those gentlemen have put themselves   useless expense” “useless” said fix “you speak confidently it’s clear  you don’t know how large  sum is” “of course i do” returned passepartout “twenty thousand pounds” “fiftyfive thousand” answered fix pressing his companion’s hand “what” cried  frenchman “has monsieur fogg dared—fiftyfive thousand pounds well there’s all  more reason  not

nothing about   mr fogg” “he knows nothing then” “nothing” replied passepartout again emptying his glass the detective passed his hand across his forehead hesitating before  spoke again what should  do passepartout’s mistake seemed sincere but  made his design more difficult it  evident   servant  not  master’s accomplice  fix had been inclined  suspect “well” said  detective  himself “as   not

“bah” retorted passepartout   air  raillery “i am  police detective sent out here   london office” “you  detective” “i  prove it here  my commission” passepartout  speechless  astonishment when fix displayed this document  genuineness  which could not  doubted “mr fogg’s wager” resumed fix “is only  pretext  which you   gentlemen   reform  dupes he had  motive  securing your innocent complicity” “but why” “listen on  th  last september  robbery  fiftyfive thousand pounds  committed   bank  england   person whose description  fortunately secured here  his description  answers exactly    mr

many presumptions there  against him passepartout essayed  reject  suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind  did not wish  believe  his master  guilty “well what do you want  me” said he  last

taking chance  his guide  wander aimlessly through  streets  yokohama he found himself  first   thoroughly european quarter  houses having low fronts  being adorned  verandas beneath which  caught glimpses  neat peristyles this quarter occupied   streets squares docks  warehouses all  space between  “promontory   treaty”   river here   hong kong  calcutta  mixed crowds  all races americans  english chinamen  dutchmen mostly merchants ready  buy or sell anything the frenchman felt himself  much alone among them  if  had dropped down   midst  hottentots he had  least one resource—to call   french  english consuls  yokohama  assistance but  shrank  telling  story  his adventures intimately connected       his master and before doing so  determined  exhaust all other means  aid as chance did not favour him   european quarter  penetrated  inhabited   native japanese determined if necessary  push   yeddo the japanese quarter  yokohama  called benten after  goddess   sea who  worshipped   islands round about there passepartout beheld beautiful fir  cedar groves sacred gates   singular architecture bridges half hid   midst  bamboos  reeds temples shaded  immense cedartrees holy retreats where  sheltered buddhist priests  sectaries  confucius  interminable streets where  perfect harvest  rosetinted  redcheeked children who looked  if they had been cut out  japanese screens  who  playing   midst  shortlegged poodles  yellowish cats might have been gathered the streets  crowded  people priests  passing  processions beating their dreary tambourines police  customhouse officers  pointed hats encrusted  lac  carrying two sabres hung  their waists soldiers clad  blue cotton  white stripes  bearing guns  mikado’s guards enveloped  silken doubles hauberks  coats  mail  numbers  military folk  all ranks—for  military profession   much respected  japan    despised  china—went hither  thither  groups  pairs passepartout saw too begging friars longrobed pilgrims  simple civilians  their warped  jetblack hair big heads long busts slender legs short stature  complexions varying  coppercolour   dead white but never yellow like  chinese  whom  japanese widely differ he did not fail  observe  curious equipages—carriages  palanquins barrows supplied  sails  litters made  bamboo nor  women—whom  thought not especially handsome—who took little steps  their little feet whereon they wore canvas shoes straw sandals  clogs  worked wood  who displayed tightlooking eyes flat chests teeth fashionably blackened  gowns crossed  silken scarfs tied   enormous knot behind  ornament which  modern parisian ladies seem  have borrowed   dames  japan passepartout wandered  several hours   midst  this motley crowd looking    windows   rich  curious shops  jewellery establishments glittering  quaint japanese ornaments  restaurants decked  streamers  banners  teahouses where  odorous beverage  being drunk  “saki”  liquor concocted   fermentation  rice   comfortable smokinghouses where they  puffing not opium which  almost unknown  japan but  very fine stringy tobacco he went  till  found himself   fields   midst  vast rice plantations there  saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves  flowers which  giving forth their last colours  perfumes not  bushes but  trees  within bamboo enclosures cherry plum  apple trees which  japanese cultivate rather  their blossoms than their fruit  which queerlyfashioned grinning scarecrows protected   sparrows pigeons ravens  other voracious birds on  branches   cedars  perched large eagles amid  foliage   weeping willows  herons solemnly standing  one leg   every hand  crows ducks hawks wild birds   multitude  cranes which  japanese consider sacred  which  their minds symbolise long life  prosperity as   strolling along passepartout espied some violets among  shrubs “good” said he “i’ll have some supper” but  smelling them  found  they  odourless “no chance there” thought he the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care  eat  hearty  breakfast  possible before leaving  “carnatic” but   had been walking about all day  demands  hunger  becoming importunate he observed   butchers stalls contained neither mutton goat nor pork and knowing also     sacrilege  kill cattle which  preserved solely  farming  made up his mind  meat  far  plentiful  yokohama—nor   mistaken and  default  butcher’s meat  could have wished   quarter  wild boar or deer  partridge or some quails some game or fish which  rice  japanese eat almost exclusively but  found  necessary  keep up  stout heart   postpone  meal  craved till  following morning night came  passepartout reentered  native quarter where  wandered through  streets lit  varicoloured lanterns looking    dancers who  executing skilful steps  boundings   astrologers who stood   open air  their telescopes then  came   harbour which  lit up   resin torches   fishermen who  fishing  their boats the streets  last became quiet   patrol  officers  which  their splendid costumes  surrounded  their suites passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors succeeded  bustling crowd each time  company passed passepartout chuckled  said  himself “good another japanese embassy departing  europe” chapter xxiii in which passepartout’s nose becomes outrageously long the next morning poor jaded famished passepartout said  himself   must get something  eat  all hazards   sooner  did so  better he might indeed sell his watch but  would have starved first now or never  must use  strong if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon him he knew several french  english songs  resolved  try them upon  japanese who must  lovers  music since they   ever pounding  their cymbals tamtams  tambourines  could not but appreciate european talent it was perhaps rather early   morning  get up  concert   audience prematurely aroused  their slumbers might not possibly pay their entertainer  coin bearing  mikado’s features passepartout therefore decided  wait several hours and    sauntering along  occurred  him   would seem rather too well dressed   wandering artist the idea struck him  change his garments  clothes more  harmony  his project  which  might also get  little money  satisfy  immediate cravings  hunger the resolution taken  remained  carry  out it  only after  long search  passepartout discovered  native dealer  old clothes  whom  applied   exchange the man liked  european costume  ere long passepartout issued  his shop accoutred   old japanese coat   sort  onesided turban faded  long use a few small pieces

leave this country   sun  which i shall not retain  most delightful  memories  quickly  possible” it occurred  him  visit  steamers which  about  leave  america he would offer himself   cook or

world passepartout  not  man  let  idea go begging  directed his steps towards  docks but   approached them his project which  first had seemed so simple began  grow more  more formidable  his mind what need would they have   cook or servant   american steamer  what confidence would they put  him dressed   was what references could  give as   reflecting  this wise his eyes fell upon  immense

“none” “the devil i should so like  cross  pacific  you” “ah” said  honourable mr batulcar “you  no more  japanese than i am  monkey who  you dressed up   way” “a man dresses   can” “that’s true you   frenchman aren’t you” “yes  parisian  paris” “then you ought  know how  make grimaces” “why” replied passepartout  little vexed  his nationality should cause this question “we frenchmen know how  make grimaces   true but not any better than  americans do” “true well if i can’t take you   servant i can   clown you see my friend  france they exhibit foreign clowns   foreign parts french clowns” “ah” “you  pretty strong eh” “especially after  good meal” “and you can sing” “yes” returned passepartout who had formerly been wont  sing   streets “but can you sing standing  your head   top spinning

passepartout turning  another passenger “but  simple idea—” “ideas  no use” returned  american shrugging his shoulders “as  engineer assures us  we can pass” “doubtless” urged passepartout “we can pass but perhaps  would  more prudent—” “what prudent” cried colonel proctor whom this word seemed  excite prodigiously “at full speed don’t you see  full speed” “i know—i see” repeated passepartout “but  would be if not more prudent since  word displeases you  least more natural—” “who what what’s  matter  this fellow” cried several the poor fellow did not know  whom  address himself “are you

if his servant   prisoner ought  not  risk everything  rescue him   indians “i  find him living or dead” said  quietly  aouda “ah mr—mr fogg” cried she clasping his hands  covering them  tears “living” added mr fogg “if we do not lose  moment” phileas fogg  this resolution inevitably sacrificed himself  pronounced his own doom the delay   single day would make him lose  steamer  new york  his bet would  certainly lost but   thought “it  my duty”  did not hesitate the commanding officer  fort kearney  there a hundred  his soldiers had placed themselves   position  defend  station should

guilty  letting fogg go alone what this man whom  had just followed around  world  permitted now  separate himself  him he began  accuse  abuse himself and  if   director  police administered  himself

knows—for having perhaps delayed you  thus contributed  your ruin” “madam you could not remain  india  your safety could only  assured  bringing you  such  distance  your persecutors could not take

solitude   sad thing  no heart  which  confide your griefs they say though  misery itself shared  two sympathetic souls may  borne  patience” “they say so madam” “mr fogg” said aouda rising  seizing his hand “do you wish  once  kinswoman  friend will you have me  your wife” mr fogg  this rose  his turn there   unwonted light  his eyes   slight trembling  his lips aouda looked into his face the sincerity rectitude firmness  sweetness  this soft glance   noble woman who could dare all  save him  whom she owed all  first astonished then penetrated him he shut his eyes   instant  if  avoid her look when  opened them again “i love you”  said simply “yes  all   holiest i love you  i am entirely yours” “ah” cried aouda pressing his hand  her heart passepartout  summoned  appeared immediately mr fogg still held aouda’s hand  his own passepartout understood  his big round face became  radiant   tropical sun   zenith mr fogg asked him if   not too late  notify  reverend samuel wilson  marylebone parish  evening passepartout smiled his most genial smile  said “never too late” it  five minutes past eight “will    tomorrow monday” “for tomorrow monday” said mr fogg turning  aouda “yes  tomorrow monday” she replied passepartout hurried off  fast  his legs could carry him chapter xxxvi in which phileas fogg’s name is once more at a premium on ’change it  time  relate what  change took place  english public opinion when  transpired   real bankrobber  certain james strand had been arrested   th day  december  edinburgh three days before phileas fogg had been  criminal who  being desperately followed up   police now    honourable gentleman mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round  world the papers resumed their discussion about  wager all those who had laid bets  or against him revived their interest  if  magic  “phileas fogg bonds” again became negotiable  many new wagers  made phileas fogg’s name  once more   premium  ’change his five friends   reform club passed these three days   state  feverish suspense would phileas fogg whom they had forgotten reappear before their eyes where    this moment the th  december  day  james strand’s arrest   seventysixth since phileas fogg’s departure  no news  him had been received was  dead had  abandoned  effort or   continuing his journey along  route agreed upon and would  appear  saturday  st  december   quarter before nine   evening   threshold   reform club saloon the anxiety  which  three days london society existed cannot  described telegrams  sent  america  asia  news  phileas fogg messengers  dispatched   house  saville row morning  evening no news the police  ignorant what had become   detective fix who had so unfortunately followed up  false scent bets increased nevertheless  number  value phileas fogg like  racehorse  drawing near his last turningpoint the bonds  quoted no longer   hundred below par but  twenty  ten   five  paralytic old lord albemarle bet even  his favour a great crowd  collected  pall mall   neighbouring streets  saturday evening  seemed like  multitude  brokers permanently established around  reform club circulation  impeded  everywhere disputes discussions  financial transactions  going on the police had great difficulty  keeping back  crowd    hour when phileas fogg  due approached  excitement rose   highest pitch the five antagonists  phileas fogg had met   great saloon   club john sullivan  samuel fallentin  bankers andrew stuart  engineer gauthier ralph  director   bank  england  thomas flanagan  brewer one  all waited anxiously when  clock indicated twenty minutes past eight andrew stuart got up saying “gentlemen  twenty minutes  time agreed upon between mr fogg  ourselves  have expired” “what time did  last train arrive  liverpool” asked thomas flanagan “at twentythree minutes past seven” replied gauthier ralph “and  next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve” “well gentlemen” resumed andrew stuart “if phileas fogg had come    train  would have got here  this time we can therefore regard  bet  won” “wait don’t let us  too hasty” replied samuel fallentin “you know  mr fogg  very eccentric his punctuality  well known  never arrives too soon or too late  i should not  surprised if  appeared before us   last minute” “why” said andrew stuart nervously “if i should see him i should not believe   he” “the fact is” resumed thomas flanagan “mr fogg’s project  absurdly foolish whatever his punctuality  could not prevent  delays which  certain  occur   delay  only two or three days would  fatal  his tour” “observe too” added john sullivan “that we have received no intelligence  him though there  telegraphic lines all along his route” “he  lost gentleman” said andrew stuart “he   hundred times lost you know besides   ‘china’—the only steamer  could have taken  new york  get here  time arrived yesterday i have seen  list   passengers   name  phileas fogg  not among them even if we admit  fortune  favoured him  can scarcely have reached america i think     least twenty days behindhand   lord albemarle  lose  cool five thousand” “it  clear” replied gauthier ralph “and we have nothing  do but  present mr fogg’s cheque  barings tomorrow” at this moment  hands   club clock pointed  twenty minutes  nine “five minutes more” said andrew stuart the five gentlemen looked  each other their anxiety  becoming intense but not wishing  betray it they readily assented  mr fallentin’s proposal   rubber “i wouldn’t give up my four thousand   bet” said andrew stuart   took his seat “for three thousand nine hundred  ninetynine” the clock indicated eighteen minutes  nine the players took up their cards but could not keep their eyes off  clock certainly however secure they felt minutes had never seemed so long  them “seventeen minutes  nine” said thomas flanagan   cut  cards which ralph handed  him then there   moment  silence the great saloon  perfectly quiet but  murmurs   crowd outside  heard  now  then  shrill cry the pendulum beat  seconds which each player eagerly counted   listened  mathematical regularity “sixteen minutes  nine” said john sullivan   voice which betrayed his emotion one minute more   wager would  won andrew stuart  his partners suspended their game they left their cards  counted  seconds at  fortieth second nothing at  fiftieth still nothing at  fiftyfifth  loud cry  heard   street followed  applause hurrahs  some fierce growls the players rose  their seats at  fiftyseventh second  door   saloon opened   pendulum had not beat  sixtieth second when phileas fogg appeared followed   excited crowd who had forced their way through  club doors   his calm voice said “here i am gentlemen” chapter xxxvii in which it is shown that phileas fogg gained nothing by his tour around the world unless it were happiness yes phileas fogg  person the reader  remember   five minutes past eight   evening—about five  twenty hours after  arrival   travellers  london—passepartout had been sent  his master  engage  services   reverend samuel wilson   certain marriage ceremony which   take place  next day passepartout went  his errand enchanted he soon reached  clergyman’s house but found him not  home passepartout waited  good twenty minutes  when  left  reverend gentleman   thirtyfive minutes past eight but  what  state  was with his hair  disorder  without his hat  ran along  street  never man  seen  run before overturning passersby rushing over  sidewalk like  waterspout in three minutes    saville row again  staggered back into mr fogg’s room he could not speak “what   matter” asked mr fogg “my master” gasped passepartout—“marriage—impossible—” “impossible” “impossible—for tomorrow” “why so” “because tomorrow—is sunday” “monday” replied mr fogg “no—today  saturday” “saturday impossible” “yes yes yes yes” cried passepartout “you have made  mistake  one day we arrived twentyfour hours ahead  time but there  only ten minutes left” passepartout had seized his master   collar   dragging him along  irresistible force phileas fogg thus kidnapped without having time  think left his house jumped into  cab promised  hundred pounds   cabman and having run over two dogs  overturned five carriages reached  reform club the clock indicated  quarter before nine when  appeared   great saloon phileas fogg had accomplished  journey round  world  eighty days phileas fogg had won his wager  twenty thousand pounds how     man so exact  fastidious could have made this error   day how came   think   had arrived  london  saturday  twentyfirst day  december when   really friday  twentieth  seventyninth day only  his departure the cause   error  very simple phileas fogg had without suspecting it gained one day  his journey  this merely because  had travelled constantly eastward  would   contrary have lost  day had  gone   opposite direction  is westward in journeying eastward  had gone towards  sun   days therefore diminished  him  many times four minutes   crossed degrees  this direction there  three hundred  sixty degrees   circumference   earth  these three hundred  sixty degrees multiplied  four minutes gives precisely twentyfour hours—that is  day unconsciously gained in other words while phileas fogg going eastward saw  sun pass  meridian eighty times his friends  london only saw  pass  meridian seventynine times this  why they awaited him   reform club  saturday  not sunday  mr fogg thought and passepartout’s famous family watch which had always kept london time would have betrayed this fact if  had marked  days  well   hours   minutes phileas fogg then had won  twenty thousand pounds but   had spent nearly nineteen thousand   way  pecuniary gain  small his object was however   victorious  not  win money he divided  one thousand pounds  remained between passepartout   unfortunate fix against whom  cherished no grudge he deducted however  passepartout’s share  cost   gas which had burned  his room  nineteen hundred  twenty hours   sake  regularity that evening mr fogg  tranquil  phlegmatic  ever said  aouda “is our marriage still agreeable  you” “mr fogg” replied she “it   me  ask  question you  ruined but now you  rich again” “pardon me madam my fortune belongs  you if you had not suggested our marriage my servant would not have gone   reverend samuel wilson’s i should not have been apprised  my error and—” “dear mr fogg” said  young woman “dear aouda” replied phileas fogg it need not  said   marriage took place fortyeight hours after   passepartout glowing  dazzling gave  bride away had  not saved her    not entitled  this honour the next day  soon    light passepartout rapped vigorously  his master’s door mr fogg opened it  asked “what’s  matter passepartout” “what  it sir why i’ve just this instant found out—” “what” “that we might have made  tour   world  only seventyeight days” “no doubt” returned mr fogg “by not crossing india but if i had not crossed india i should not have saved aouda she would not have been my wife and—” mr fogg quietly shut  door phileas fogg had won his wager  had made his journey around  world  eighty days to do this  had employed every means  conveyance—steamers railways carriages yachts tradingvessels sledges elephants the eccentric gentleman had throughout displayed all his marvellous qualities  coolness  exactitude but what then what had  really gained  all this trouble what had  brought back  this long  weary journey nothing say you perhaps so nothing but  charming woman who strange   may
