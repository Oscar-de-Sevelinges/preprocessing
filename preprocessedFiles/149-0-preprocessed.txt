three thousand feet all night we had hovered above  tossing billows   moonlight clouds the detonation   thunder   glare  lightning through  occasional rift   vaporous wall proclaimed  continued fury   tempest upon  surface   sea but we far above  all rode  comparative ease upon  upper gale with  coming  dawn  clouds beneath us became  glorious sea  gold  silver soft  beautiful but they could not

have been working upon  steadily since but i have  report sir    beyond repair” “number two  keep us supplied” i answered “in  meantime we  send  wireless  relief” “but    trouble sir”  went on “number two  stopped i knew  would come sir i made  report  these generators three years ago i advised then  they both  scrapped their principle  entirely wrong they’re done for” and   grim smile “i shall  least have  satisfaction  knowing my report  accurate” “have we sufficient reserve screen  permit us  make land or  least meet our relief halfway” i asked “no sir”  replied gravely “we  sinking now” “have you anything further  report” i asked “no sir”  said “very good” i replied and  i dismissed him i rang  my wireless operator when  appeared i gave him  message   secretary   navy  whom all

there  been   past no excuse no circumstance  could palliate  offense “he   command   took his ship across thirty” that  sufficient it might not have been  any way his fault as   case   coldwater  could not possibly have been justly charged  my account   gravitationscreen generators  worthless but well i knew  should chance have   we  blown across thirty today—as we might easily  before

depths  ocean which no storm could ruffle as i stood speculating upon our chances once we settled into  frightful maelstrom beneath us    same time mentally computing  hours which must elapse before aid could reach us  wireless operator clambered up  ladder   bridge and disheveled  breathless stood before me  salute it needed but  glance  him  assure me  something  amiss “what now” i asked “the wireless sir”  cried “my god sir i cannot send” “but  emergency outfit” i asked “i have tried everything sir i have exhausted every resource we cannot send”   drew himself up  saluted again i dismissed him   few kind words  i knew    through no fault  his   mechanism  antiquated  worthless  common   balance   coldwaterl’s equipment there  no finer operator  panamerica than he the failure   wireless did not appear  momentous  me   him which  not unnatural since   but human  feel  when our own little cog slips  entire universe must necessarily  put out  gear i knew  if this storm  destined  blow us across thirty or send us   bottom   ocean no help could reach us  time  prevent it i had ordered  message sent solely because regulations required it  not  any particular hope  we could benefit    our present extremity i had little time  dwell upon  coincidence   simultaneous failure   wireless   buoyancy generators since very shortly after  coldwater had dropped so low over  waters  all my attention  necessarily centered upon  delicate business  settling upon  waves without breaking my shipl’s back with our buoyancy generators  commission  would have been  simple thing  enter  water since then  would have been but  trifling matter   fortyfive degree dive into  base   huge wave we should have cut into  water like  hot knife through butter  have been totally submerged  scarce  jar—i have done   thousand times—but i did not dare submerge  coldwater  fear   would remain submerged   end  time—a condition far  conducive   longevity  commander or crew most  my officers  older men than i john alvarez my first officer  twenty years my senior he stood  my side   bridge   ship glided closer  closer  those stupendous waves he watched my every move but    far too fine  officer  gentleman  embarrass me  either comment or suggestion when i saw  we soon would touch i ordered  ship brought around broadside   wind  there we hovered  moment until  huge wave reached up  seized us upon  crest  then i gave  order  suddenly reversed  screening force  let us into  ocean down into  trough we went wallowing like  carcass   dead whale  then began  fight  rudder  propellers  force  coldwater back into  teeth   gale  drive her   on farther  farther  relentless thirty i think  we should have succeeded even though  ship  wracked  stem  stern   terrific buffetings she received  though she  half submerged  greater part   time had no further accident befallen us we  making headway though slowly   began  look  though we  going  pull through alvarez never left my side though i all but ordered him below  muchneeded rest my second officer porfirio johnson  also often   bridge he   good officer but  man  whom i had conceived  rather unreasoning aversion almost   first moment  meeting him  aversion which  not lessened   knowledge which i subsequently gained   looked upon my rapid promotion  jealousy he  ten years my senior both  years  service  i rather think  could never forget  fact   had been  officer when i   green apprentice as  became more  more apparent   coldwater under my seamanship  weathering  tempest  giving promise  pulling through safely i could have sworn  i perceived  shade  annoyance  disappointment growing upon his dark countenance he left  bridge finally  went below i do not know    directly responsible  what followed so shortly after but i have always had my suspicions  alvarez  even more prone  place  blame upon him than i it  about six bells   forenoon watch  johnson returned   bridge after  absence  some thirty minutes he seemed nervous  ill  ease—a fact which made little impression  me   time but which both alvarez  i recalled subsequently not three minutes after his reappearance  my side  coldwater suddenly commenced  lose headway i seized  telephone  my elbow pressing upon  button which would call  chief engineer   instrument   bowels   ship only  find him already   receiver attempting  reach me “numbers one two  five engines have broken down sir”  called “shall we force  remaining three” “we can do nothing else” i bellowed into  transmitter “they won’t stand  gaff sir”  returned “can you suggest  better plan” i asked “no sir”  replied “then give them  gaff lieutenant” i shouted back  hung up  receiver for twenty minutes  coldwater bucked  great seas  her three engines i doubt if she advanced  foot but   enough  keep her nose   wind and  least we  not drifting toward thirty johnson  alvarez   my side when without warning  bow swung swiftly around   ship fell into  trough   sea “the other three have gone” i said  i happened   looking  johnson  i spoke was   shadow   satisfied smile  crossed his thin lips i do not know but  least  did not weep “you always have been curious sir about  great unknown beyond thirty”  said “you    good way  have your curiosity satisfied” and then i could not mistake  slight sneer  curved his upper lip there must have been  trace  disrespect  his tone or manner which escaped me  alvarez turned upon him like  flash “when lieutenant turck crosses thirty”  said “we shall all cross  him  god help  officer or  man who reproaches him” “i shall not   party  high treason” snapped johnson “the regulations  explicit  if  coldwater crosses thirty  devolves upon you  place lieutenant turck under arrest  immediately exert every endeavor  bring  ship back into panamerican waters” “i shall not know” replied alvarez “that  coldwater passes thirty nor shall any other man aboard know it” and  his words  drew  revolver  his pocket  before either i or johnson could prevent  had put  bullet into every instrument upon  bridge ruining them beyond repair and then  saluted me  strode   bridge  martyr  loyalty  friendship for though no man might know  lieutenant jefferson turck had taken his ship across thirty every man aboard would know   first officer had committed  crime   punishable  both degradation  death johnson turned  eyed me narrowly “shall i place him under arrest”  asked “you shall not” i replied “nor shall anyone else” “you become  party  his crime”  cried angrily “you may go below mr johnson” i said “and attend   work  unpacking  extra instruments  having them properly set upon  bridge” he saluted  left me   some time i stood gazing out upon  angry waters my mind filled  unhappy reflections upon  unjust fate  had overtaken me   sorrow  disgrace  i had unwittingly brought down upon my house i rejoiced  i should leave neither wife nor child  bear  burden  my shame throughout their lives as i thought upon my misfortune i considered more clearly than ever before  unrighteousness   regulation which   prove my doom    natural revolt against  injustice my anger rose  there mounted within me  feeling which i imagine must have paralleled  spirit  once  prevalent among  ancients called anarchy for  first time  my life i found my sentiments arraying themselves against custom tradition  even government the wave  rebellion swept over me   instant beginning   heretical doubt    sanctity   established order  things—that fetish which  ruled panamericans  two centuries  which  based upon  blind faith   infallibility   prescience   longdead framers   articles  panamerican federation—and ending   adamantine determination  defend my honor  my life   last ditch against  blind  senseless regulation which assumed  synonymity  misfortune  treason i would replace  destroyed instruments upon  bridge every officer  man should know when we crossed thirty but then i should assert  spirit which dominated me i should resist arrest  insist upon bringing my ship back across  dead line remaining  my post until we had reached new york then i should make  full report     demand upon public opinion   dead lines  wiped forever   seas i knew  i  right i knew  no more loyal officer wore  uniform   navy i knew  i   good officer  sailor  i didn’t propose submitting  degradation  discharge because  lot  old preglacial fossils had declared over two hundred years before  no man should cross thirty even while these thoughts  passing through my mind i  busy   details  my duties i had seen     sea anchor  rigged  even now  men had completed their task   coldwater  swinging around rapidly her nose pointing once more into  wind   frightful rolling consequent upon her wallowing   trough  happily diminishing it  then  johnson came hurrying   bridge one  his eyes  swollen  already darkening  his lip  cut  bleeding without even  formality   salute  burst upon me white  fury “lieutenant alvarez attacked me”  cried “i demand    placed under arrest i found him   act  destroying  reserve instruments  when i would have interfered  protect them  fell upon me  beat me i demand  you arrest him” “you forget yourself mr johnson” i said “you  not  command   ship i deplore  action  lieutenant alvarez but i cannot expunge  my mind  loyalty  selfsacrificing friendship which  prompted him  his acts were i you sir i should profit   example   set further mr johnson i intend retaining command   ship even though she crosses thirty  i shall demand implicit obedience  every officer  man aboard until i am properly relieved  duty   superior officer   port  new york” “you mean  say  you  cross thirty without submitting  arrest”  almost shouted “i do sir” i replied “and now you may go below and when again you find  necessary  address me you  please  so good   bear  mind  fact  i am your commanding officer   such entitled   salute” he flushed hesitated  moment  then saluting turned upon his heel  left  bridge shortly after alvarez appeared he  pale  seemed  have aged ten years   few brief minutes since i last had seen him saluting  told me very simply what  had done  asked  i place him under arrest i put my hand  his shoulder  i guess  my voice trembled  trifle as while reproving him  his act i made  plain  him  my gratitude  no less potent  force than his loyalty  me then    i outlined  him my purpose  defy  regulation  had raised  dead lines   take my ship back  new york myself i did not ask him  share  responsibility  me i merely stated  i should refuse  submit  arrest   i should demand  him  every other officer  man implicit obedience  my every command until we docked  home his face brightened  my words   assured me  i would find him  ready  acknowledge my command upon  wrong side  thirty  upon  right  assurance which i hastened  tell him i did not need the storm continued  rage  three days   far   wind scarce varied  point during all  time i knew  we must  far beyond thirty drifting rapidly east  south all this time  had been impossible  work upon  damaged engines or  gravityscreen generators but we had  full set  instruments upon  bridge  alvarez after discovering my intentions had fetched  reserve instruments  his own cabin where  had hidden them those which johnson had seen him destroy had been  third set which only alvarez had known  aboard  coldwater we waited impatiently   sun  we might determine our exact location  upon  fourth day our vigil  rewarded  few minutes before noon every officer  man aboard  tense  nervous excitement  we awaited  result   reading the crew had known almost  soon  i  we  doomed  cross thirty  i am inclined  believe  every man jack  them  tickled  death   spirits  adventure  romance still live   hearts  men   twentysecond century even though there  little  them  feed upon between thirty  one hundred seventyfive the men carried none   burdens  responsibility they might cross thirty  impunity  doubtless they would return   heroes  home but how different  homecoming  their commanding officer the wind had dropped   steady blow still  west  north   sea had gone down correspondingly the crew   exception  those whose duties kept them below  ranged  deck below  bridge when our position  definitely fixed i personally announced    eager waiting men “men” i said stepping forward   handrail  looking down into their upturned bronzed faces “you  anxiously awaiting information    shipl’s position it  been determined  latitude fifty degrees seven minutes north longitude twenty degrees sixteen minutes west” i paused   buzz  animated comment ran through  massed men beneath me “beyond thirty but there   no change  commanding officers  routine or  discipline until after we have docked again  new york” as i ceased speaking  stepped back   rail there   roar  applause   deck such  i never before had heard aboard  ship  peace it recalled  my mind tales  i had read   good old days when naval vessels  built  fight when ships  peace had been menofwar  guns had flashed  other than futile target practice  decks had run red  blood with  subsidence   sea we  able  go  work upon  damaged engines  some effect  i also set men  examining  gravitationscreen generators   view  putting them  working order should  prove not beyond our resources for two weeks we labored   engines which indisputably showed evidence  having been tampered with i appointed  board  investigate  report upon  disaster but  accomplished nothing other than  convince me  there  several officers upon  who   full sympathy  johnson for though no charges had been preferred against him  board went out   way specifically  exonerate him   findings all this time we  drifting almost due east the work upon  engines had progressed  such  extent  within  few hours we might expect   able  proceed under our own power westward   direction  panamerican waters to relieve  monotony i had taken  fishing  early  morning i had departed   coldwater  one   boats  such  excursion a gentle west wind  blowing the sea shimmered   sunlight a cloudless sky canopied  west  our sport  i had made   point never voluntarily  make  inch toward  east  i could avoid at least they should not  able  charge me   willful violation   dead lines regulation i had  me only  boatl’s ordinary complement  men—three  all  more than enough  handle any small power boat i had not asked any  my officers  accompany me  i wished   alone  very glad am i now  i had not my only regret  that  view  what befell us  had been necessary  bring  three brave fellows who manned  boat our fishing which proved excellent carried us so far   west  we no longer could see  coldwater the day wore on until  last about midafternoon i gave  order  return   ship we had proceeded but  short distance toward  east when one   men gave  exclamation  excitement   same time pointing eastward we all looked    direction  had indicated  there  short distance above  horizon we saw  outlines   coldwater silhouetted against  sky “they’ve repaired  engines   generators both” exclaimed one   men it seemed impossible but yet  had evidently been done only  morning lieutenant johnson had told me   feared   would  impossible  repair  generators i had put him  charge  this work since  always had been accounted one   best gravitationscreen men   navy he had invented several   improvements   incorporated   later models  these generators  i am convinced   knows more concerning both  theory   practice  screening gravitation than any living panamerican at  sight   coldwater once more under control  three men burst into  glad cheer but  some reason which i could not then account i  strangely overcome   premonition  personal misfortune it  not  i now anticipated  early return  panamerica   board  inquiry  i had rather looked forward   fight  must follow my return no there  something else something indefinable  vague  cast  strange gloom upon me  i saw my ship rising farther above  water  making straight  our direction i  not long  ascertaining  possible explanation  my depression for though we  plainly visible   bridge   aerosubmarine    hundreds  men who swarmed her deck  ship passed directly above us not five hundred feet   water  sped directly westward we all shouted  i fired my pistol  attract their attention though i knew full well  all who cared  had observed us but  ship moved steadily away growing smaller  smaller  our view until  last she passed completely out  sight chapter ii what could  mean i had left alvarez  command he  my most loyal subordinate it  absolutely beyond  pale  possibility  alvarez should desert me no there  some other explanation something occurred  place my second officer porfirio johnson  command i  sure   but why speculate the futility  conjecture  only too palpable the coldwater had abandoned us  midocean doubtless none  us would survive  know why the young man   wheel   power boat had turned her nose about   became evident   ship intended passing over us  now  still held her  futile pursuit   coldwater “bring her about snider” i directed “and hold her due east we can’t catch  coldwater  we can’t cross  atlantic  this our only hope lies  making  nearest land which unless i am mistaken   scilly islands off  southwest coast  england ever heard  england snider” “there’s  part   united states  north america  used   known   ancients  new england”  replied “is  where you mean sir” “no snider” i replied “the england i refer    island off  continent  europe it   seat   very powerful kingdom  flourished over two hundred years ago a part   united states  north america  all   federated states  canada once belonged  this ancient england” “europe” breathed one   men his voice tense  excitement “my grandfather used  tell me stories   world beyond thirty he had been  great student   had read much  forbidden books” “in which i resemble your grandfather” i said “for i too have read more even than naval officers  supposed  read and  you men know we  permitted  greater latitude   study  geography  history than men  other professions “among  books  papers  admiral porter turck who lived two hundred years ago   whom i am descended many volumes still exist    my possession which deal   history  geography  ancient europe usually i bring several  these books  me upon  cruise  this time among others i have maps  europe  her surrounding waters i  studying them  we came away   coldwater this morning  luckily i have them  me” “you  going  try  make europe sir” asked taylor  young man who had last spoken “it   nearest land” i replied “i have always wanted  explore  forgotten lands   eastern hemisphere here’s our chance to remain  sea   perish none  us ever  see home again let us make  best  it  enjoy while we do live  which  forbidden  balance  our race—the adventure   mystery which lie beyond thirty” taylor  delcarte seized  spirit  my mood but snider i think   trifle sceptical “it  treason sir” i replied “but there  no law which compels us  visit punishment upon ourselves could we return  panamerica i should   first  insist  we face it but we know thatl’s not possible even if this craft would carry us so far we haven’t enough water or food  more than three days “we  doomed snider  die far  home  without ever again looking upon  face  another fellow countryman than those who sit here now  this boat isn’t  punishment sufficient  even  most exacting judge” even snider had  admit   was “very well then let us live while we live  enjoy   fullest whatever  adventure or pleasure each new day brings since any day may  our last  we shall  dead   considerable while” i could see  snider  still fearful but taylor  delcarte responded   hearty “aye aye sir” they   different mold both  sons  naval officers they represented  aristocracy  birth  they dared  think  themselves snider    minority  so we continued toward  east beyond thirty  separated  my ship my authority ceased i held leadership if i   hold   all  virtue  personal qualifications only but i did not doubt my ability  remain  director  our destinies  so far  they  amenable  human agencies i have always led while my brain  brawn remain unimpaired i shall continue always  lead following   art which turcks do not easily learn it  not until  third day  we raised land dead ahead which i took  my map    isles  scilly but such  gale  blowing  i did not dare attempt  land  so we passed   north  them skirted landl’s end  entered  english channel i think  up   moment i had never experienced such  thrill  passed through me when i realized  i  navigating these historic waters the lifelong dreams  i never had dared hope  see fulfilled   last  reality—but under what forlorn circumstances never could i return  my native land to  end  my days i must remain  exile yet even these thoughts failed  dampen my ardor my eyes scanned  waters to  north i could see  rockbound coast  cornwall mine   first american eyes  rest upon   more

far  eye could reach  tossing waters   channel  empty  deserted toward midnight  wind  sea abated so  shortly after dawn i determined  make inshore   attempt  effect  landing  we  sadly  need  fresh

given  devonport which appeared  lie   mouth   river tamar however i knew   would make little difference which city we entered   english people  famed  old  their hospitality toward visiting mariners as we approached  mouth   bay i looked   fishing craft which i expected  see emerging thus early   day  their labors but even after we rounded ram head   well within  waters   bay i saw no vessel neither  there buoy nor light nor any other mark  show larger ships  channel  i wondered much  this the coast  densely overgrown nor  any building or sign  man apparent   water up  bay  into  river tamar we motored through  solitude  unbroken   which rested upon  waters   channel for all we could see there  no indication  man had ever set his foot upon this silent coast i  nonplused  then   first time there crept over me  intuition   truth here  no sign  war as far  this portion   devon coast  concerned  seemed  have been over  many years but neither  there any people yet i could not find  within myself  believe  i should find no inhabitants  england reasoning thus i discovered    improbable   state  war still existed    people all had been drawn  this portion  england  some other where they might better defend themselves against  invader but what  their ancient coast defenses what  there here  plymouth bay  prevent  enemy landing  force  marching where they wished nothing i could not believe  any enlightened military nation such   ancient english  reputed  have been would have voluntarily so deserted  exposed coast   excellent harbor   mercies   enemy i found myself becoming more  more deeply involved  quandary the puzzle which confronted me i could not unravel we had landed  i now stood upon  spot where according  my map  large city should rear  spires  chimneys there  nothing but rough broken ground covered densely  weeds  brambles  tall rank grass had  city ever stood there no sign   remained the roughness  unevenness   ground suggested something   great mass  debris hidden   accumulation  centuries  undergrowth i drew  short cutlass  which both officers  men   navy are  you know armed out  courtesy   traditions  memories   past    point dug into  loam about  roots   vegetation growing  my feet the blade entered  soil   matter  seven inches when  struck upon something stonelike digging about  obstacle i presently loosened it  when i had withdrawn    sepulcher i found  thing    ancient brick  clay baked   oven delcarte we had left  charge   boat but snider  taylor   me  following my example each engaged   fascinating sport  prospecting  antiques each  us uncovered  great number  these bricks until we commenced  weary   monotony  it when snider suddenly gave  exclamation  excitement and  i turned  look  held up  human skull  my inspection i took   him  examined it directly   center   forehead   small round hole the gentleman had evidently come  his end defending his country   invader snider again held aloft another trophy   search—a metal spike  some tarnished  corroded metal ornaments they had lain close beside  skull with  point  his cutlass snider scraped  dirt  verdigris   face   larger ornament “an inscription”  said  handed  thing  me they   spike  ornaments   ancient german helmet before long we had uncovered many other indications   great battle had been fought upon  ground where we stood but i  then  still am  loss  account   presence  german soldiers upon  english coast so far  london which history suggests would have been  natural goal   invader i can only account    assuming  either england  temporarily conquered   teutons or   invasion  so vast proportions  undertaken  german troops  hurled upon  england coast  huge numbers   landings  necessarily effected  many places simultaneously subsequent discoveries tend  strengthen this view we dug about   short time  our cutlasses until i became convinced   city had stood upon  spot  some time   past   beneath our feet crumbled  dead lay ancient devonport i could not repress  sigh   thought   havoc war had wrought  this part  england  least farther east nearer london we should find things very different there would   civilization  two centuries must have wrought upon our english cousins  they had upon us there would  mighty cities cultivated fields happy people there we would  welcomed  longlost brothers there would we find  great nation anxious  learn   world beyond their side  thirty  i had been anxious  learn   which lay beyond our side   dead line i turned back toward  boat “come men” i said “we  go up  river  fill our casks  fresh water search  food  fuel  then tomorrow   readiness  push  toward  east i am going  london” chapter iii the report   gun blasted  silence   dead devonport  startling abruptness it came   direction   launch    instant we three  running   boat  fast  our legs would carry us as we came  sight   we saw delcarte  hundred yards inland   launch leaning over something which lay upon  ground as we called  him  waved his cap  stooping lifted  small deer  our inspection i  about  congratulate him  his trophy when we  startled   horrid halfhuman halfbestial scream  little ahead    right  us it seemed  come   clump  rank  tangled bush not far  where delcarte stood it   horrid fearsome sound  like  which never had fallen upon my ears before we looked   direction  which  came the smile had died  delcarte’s lips even   distance we   him i saw his face go suddenly white   quickly threw his rifle  his shoulder at  same moment  thing  had given tongue   cry moved   concealing brushwood far enough  us too  see it both taylor  snider gave little gasps  astonishment  dismay “what  it sir” asked  latter the creature stood about  height   tall manl’s waist   long  gaunt  sinuous   tawny coat striped  black   white throat  belly in conformation   similar   cat—a huge cat exaggerated colossal cat  fiendish eyes   most devilish cast  countenance   wrinkled  bristling snout  bared  great yellow fangs it  pacing or rather slinking straight  delcarte who had now leveled his rifle upon it “what  it sir” mumbled snider again  then  halfforgotten picture   old natural history sprang  my mind  i recognized   frightful beast  felis tigris  ancient asia specimens  which had  former centuries been exhibited   western hemisphere snider  taylor  armed  rifles  revolvers while i carried only  revolver seizing sniderl’s rifle  his trembling hands i called  taylor  follow me  together we ran forward shouting  attract  beastl’s attention  delcarte until we should all  quite close enough  attack   greatest assurance  success i cried  delcarte not  fire until we reached his side  i  fearful lest our small caliber steeljacketed bullets should far  killing  beast tend merely  enrage  still further but  misunderstood me thinking  i had ordered him  fire with  report  his rifle  tiger stopped short  apparent surprise then turned  bit savagely   shoulder   instant after which  wheeled again toward delcarte issuing  most terrific roars  screams  launched itself  incredible speed toward  brave fellow who now stood his ground pumping bullets  his automatic rifle  rapidly   weapon would fire taylor  i also opened up   creature     broadside  us  offered  splendid target though  all  impression we appeared  make upon  great cat we might  well have been launching soap bubbles  it straight   torpedo  rushed  delcarte and  taylor  i stumbled  through  tall grass toward our unfortunate comrade we saw  tiger rear upon him  crush him   earth not  backward step had  noble delcarte taken two hundred years  peace had not sapped  red blood  his courageous line he went down beneath  avalanche  bestial savagery still working his gun   his face toward his antagonist even   instant  i thought him dead i could not help but feel  thrill  pride    one  my men one  my class  panamerican gentleman  birth and   had demonstrated one   principal contentions   armyandnavy adherents—that military training  necessary   salvation  personal courage   panamerican race which  generations had had  face no dangers more grave than those incident  ordinary life   highly civilized community safeguarded  every means   disposal   perfectly organized  allpowerful government utilizing  best  advanced science could suggest as we ran toward delcarte both taylor  i  struck   fact   beast upon him appeared not   mauling him but lay quiet  motionless upon  prey  when we  quite close   muzzles  our guns    animal’s head i saw  explanation  this sudden cessation  hostilities—felis tigris  dead one  our bullets or one   last  delcarte fired had penetrated  heart   beast had died even   sprawled forward crushing delcarte   ground a moment later  our assistance  man had scrambled  beneath  carcass  his wouldbe slayer without  scratch  indicate how close  death  had been delcarte’s buoyance  entirely unruffled he came  under  tiger   broad grin  his handsome face nor could i perceive   muscle trembled or  his voice showed  least indication  nervousness or excitement with  termination   adventure we began  speculate upon  explanation   presence  this savage brute  large so great  distance   native habitat my readings had taught me    practically unknown outside  asia  that so late   twentieth century  least there had been no savage beasts outside captivity  england as we talked snider joined us  i returned his rifle  him taylor  delcarte picked up  slain deer  we all started down toward  launch walking slowly delcarte wanted  fetch  tigerl’s skin but i had  deny him permission since we had no means  properly cure it upon  beach we skinned  deer  cut away  much meat  we thought we could dispose of   we  again embarking  continue up  river  fresh water  fuel we  startled   series  screams   bushes  short distance away “another felis tigris” said taylor “or  dozen  them” supplemented delcarte and even   spoke there leaped into sight one after another eight   beasts full grown—magnificent specimens at  sight  us they came charging down like infuriated demons i saw  three rifles would  no match  them  so i gave  word  put out  shore hoping   “tiger”   ancients called him could not swim sure enough they all halted   beach pacing back  forth uttering fiendish cries  glaring  us   most malevolent manner as we motored away we presently heard  calls  similar animals far inland they seemed   answering  cries  their fellows   waterl’s edge    wide distribution  great volume   sound we came   conclusion  enormous numbers  these beasts must roam  adjacent country “they have eaten up  inhabitants” murmured snider shuddering “i imagine you  right” i agreed “for their extreme boldness  fearlessness   presence  man would suggest either  man  entirely unknown  them or  they  extremely familiar  him  their natural  most easily procured prey” “but where did they come from” asked delcarte “could they have traveled here  asia” i shook my head the thing   puzzle  me i knew    practically beyond reason  imagine  tigers had crossed  mountain ranges  rivers  all  great continent  europe  travel this far  their native lairs  entirely impossible  they should have crossed  english channel  all yet here they were   great numbers we continued up  tamar several miles filled our casks  then landed  cook some  our deer steak  have  first square meal  had fallen  our lot since  coldwater deserted us but scarce had we built our fire  prepared  meat  cooking than snider whose eyes had been constantly roving about  landscape   moment  we left  launch touched me   arm  pointed   clump  bushes which grew  couple  hundred yards away half concealed behind their screening foliage i saw  yellow  black   big tiger and  i looked  beast stalked majestically toward us a moment later   followed  another  another    needless  state  we beat  hasty retreat   launch the country  apparently infested  these huge carnivora  after three other attempts  land  cook our food we  forced  abandon  idea entirely  each time we  driven off  hunting tigers it  also equally impossible  obtain  necessary ingredients  our chemical fuel and  we had very little left aboard we determined  step our folding mast  proceed under sail hoarding our fuel supply  use  emergencies i may say     no regret  we bid adieu  tigerland  we rechristened  ancient devon and beating out into  channel turned  launchl’s nose southeast  round bolt head  continue up  coast toward  strait  dover   north sea i  determined  reach london  soon  possible  we might obtain fresh clothing meet  cultured people  learn   lips  englishmen  secrets   two centuries since  east had been divorced   west our first stopping place   isle  wight we entered  solent about ten o’clock one morning  i must confess  my heart sank  we came close  shore no lighthouse  visible though one  plainly indicated upon my map upon neither shore  sign  human habitation we skirted  northern shore   island  fruitless search  man  then  last landed upon  eastern point where newport should have stood but where only weeds  great trees  tangled wild wood rioted  not  single manmade thing  visible   eye before landing i had  men substitute soft bullets   steeljacketed projectiles  which their belts  magazines  filled thus equipped we felt upon more even terms   tigers but there  no sign   tigers  i decided  they must  confined   mainland after eating we set out  search  fuel leaving taylor  guard  launch for some reason i could not trust snider alone i knew   looked  disapproval upon my plan  visit england  i did not know but what  his first opportunity  might desert us taking  launch  him  attempt  return  panamerica that  would  fool enough  venture it i did not doubt we had gone inland   mile or more   passing through  parklike wood when we came suddenly upon  first human beings we had seen since we sighted  english coast there   score  men   party hairy halfnaked men they were resting   shade   great tree at  first sight  us they sprang  their feet  wild yells seizing long spears  had lain beside them  they rested for  matter  fifty yards they ran  us  rapidly  they could  then they turned  surveyed us   moment evidently emboldened   scarcity  our numbers they commenced  advance upon us brandishing their spears  shouting horribly they  short  muscular  build  long hair  beards tangled  matted  filth their heads however  shapely  their eyes though fierce  warlike  intelligent appreciation  these physical attributes came later  course when i had better opportunity  study  men  close range  under circumstances less fraught  danger  excitement at  moment i saw   unmixed wonder only  score  wild savages charging down upon us where i had expected  find  community  civilized  enlightened people each  us  armed  rifle revolver  cutlass but  we stood shoulder  shoulder facing  wild men i  loath  give  command  fire upon them inflicting death or suffering upon strangers  whom we had no quarrel  so i attempted  restrain them   moment  we might parley  them to this end i raised my left hand above my head   palm toward them   most natural gesture indicative  peaceful intentions which occurred  me at  same time i called aloud  them  we  friends though  their appearance there  nothing  indicate  they might understand panamerican or ancient english which   course practically identical at my gesture  words they ceased their shouting  came   halt  few paces  us then  deep tones one who   advance   others  whom i took    chief or leader   party replied   tongue which while intelligible  us  so distorted   english language  which  evidently had sprung     difficulty  we interpreted it “who  you”  asked “and  what country” i told him  we   panamerica but  only shook his head  asked where  was he had never heard  it or   atlantic ocean which i told him separated his country  mine “it  been two hundred years” i told him “since  panamerican visited england” “england”  asked “what  england” “why this   part  england” i exclaimed “this  grubitten”  assured me “i know nothing about england  i have lived here all my life” it  not until long after   derivation  grubitten occurred  me unquestionably    corruption  great britain  name formerly given   large island comprising england scotland  wales subsequently we heard  pronounced grabrittin  grubritten i then asked  fellow if  could direct us  ryde or newport but again  shook his head  said   never had heard  such countries and when i asked him if there  any cities  this country  did not know what i meant never having heard  word cities i explained my meaning  best i could  stating   city i referred   place where many people lived together  houses “oh”  exclaimed “you mean  camp yes there  two great camps here east camp  west camp we   east camp” the use   word camp  describe  collection  habitations naturally suggested war  me  my next question    whether  war  over  who had been victorious “no”  replied  this question “the war  not yet over but  soon  be    end   always does   westenders running away we  eastenders  always victorious” “no” i said seeing   referred   petty tribal wars  his little island “i mean  great war  war  germany is  ended—and who  victorious” he shook his head impatiently “i never heard”  said “of any  these strange countries  which you speak” it seemed incredible  yet   true these people living   very seat   great war knew nothing  it though but two centuries had passed since  our knowledge  had been running   height   titanic frightfulness all about them   us upon  far side   atlantic still   subject  keen interest here   lifelong inhabitant   isle  wight who never had heard  either germany or england i turned  him quite suddenly   new question “what people live upon  mainland” i asked  pointed   direction   hants coast “no one lives there”  replied “long ago   said my people dwelt across  waters upon  other land but  wild beasts devoured them  such numbers  finally they  driven here paddling across upon logs  driftwood nor  any dared return since because   frightful creatures which dwell   horrid country” “do no other peoples ever come  your country  ships” i asked he never heard  word ship before  did not know  meaning but  assured me  until we came  had thought  there  no other peoples   world other than  grubittens who consist   eastenders   westenders   ancient isle  wight assured  we  inclined  friendliness our new acquaintances led us  their village or  they call it camp there we found  thousand people perhaps dwelling  rude shelters  living upon  fruits   chase  such sea food   obtainable close  shore  they had no boats nor any knowledge  such things their weapons  most primitive consisting  rude spears tipped  pieces  metal pounded roughly into shape they had no literature no religion  recognized no law other than  law  might they produced fire  striking  bit  flint  steel together but   most part they ate their food raw marriage  unknown among them  while they have  word mother they did not know what i meant  “father” the males fight   favor   females they practice infanticide  kill  aged  physically unfit the family consists   mother   children  men dwelling sometimes  one hut  sometimes  another owing  their bloody duels they  always numerically inferior   women so there  shelter  them all we spent several hours   village where we  objects   greatest curiosity the inhabitants examined our clothing  all our belongings  asked innumerable questions concerning  strange country  which we had come   manner  our coming i questioned many  them concerning past historical events but they knew nothing beyond  narrow limits  their island   savage primitive life they led there london they had never heard of  they assured me  i would find no human beings upon  mainland much saddened  what i had seen i took my departure  them   three  us made our way back   launch accompanied  about five hundred men women girls  boys as we sailed away after procuring  necessary ingredients  our chemical fuel  grubittens lined  shore  silent wonder   strange sight  our dainty craft dancing over  sparkling waters  watched us until we  lost  their sight chapter iv it  during  morning  july    we entered  mouth   thames—to  best  my knowledge  first western keel  cut those historic waters  two hundred  twentyone years but where   tugs   lighters   barges  lightships   buoys  all those countless attributes which went  make up  myriad life   ancient thames gone all gone only silence  desolation reigned where once  commerce   world had centered i could not help but compare this once great waterway   waters about our new york or rio or san diego or valparaiso they had become what they  today during  two centuries   profound peace which we   navy have been prone  deplore and what during this same period had shorn  waters   thames  their pristine grandeur militarist  i am i could find but  single word  explanation—war i bowed my head  turned my eyes downward   lonely  depressing sight    silence which none  us seemed willing  break we proceeded up  deserted river we had reached  point which  my map i imagined must have been about  former site  erith when i discovered  small band  antelope  short distance inland as we  now entirely out  meat once more   i had given up all expectations  finding  city upon  site  ancient london i determined  land  bag  couple   animals assured  they would  timid  easily frightened i decided  stalk them alone telling  men  wait   boat until i called  them  come  carry  carcasses back   shore crawling carefully through  vegetation making use  such trees  bushes  afforded shelter i came  last almost within easy range  my quarry when  antlered head   buck went suddenly into  air  then  though  accordance   prearranged signal  whole band moved slowly off farther inland as their pace  leisurely i determined  follow them until i came again within range  i  sure  they would stop  feed   short time they must have led me  mile or more  least before they again halted  commenced  browse upon  rank luxuriant grasses all  time  i had followed them i had kept both eyes  ears alert  sign or sound  would indicate  presence  felis tigris but so far not  slightest indication   beast had been apparent as i crept closer   antelope sure this time   good shot   large buck i suddenly saw something  caused me  forget all about my prey  wonderment it   figure   immense greyblack creature rearing  colossal shoulders twelve or fourteen feet above  ground never  my life had i seen such  beast nor did i  first recognize it so different  appearance   live reality   stuffed unnatural specimens preserved  us  our museums but presently i guessed  identity   mighty creature  elephas africanus or   ancients commonly described it african elephant the antelope although  plain view   huge beast paid not  slightest attention  it  i  so wrapped up  watching  mighty pachyderm  i quite forgot  shoot   buck  presently   quite  startling manner  became impossible  do so the elephant  browsing upon  young  tender shoots  some low bushes waving his great ears  switching his short tail the antelope scarce twenty paces  him continued their feeding when suddenly  close beside  latter there came  most terrifying roar  i saw  great tawny body shoot   concealing verdure beyond  antelope full upon  back   small buck instantly  scene changed  one  quiet  peace  indescribable chaos the startled  terrified buck uttered cries  agony his fellows broke  leaped off  all directions the elephant raised his trunk and trumpeting loudly lumbered off through  wood crushing down small trees  trampling bushes  his mad flight growling horribly  huge lion stood across  body  his prey—such  creature  no panamerican   twentysecond century had ever beheld until my eyes rested upon this lordly specimen  “the king  beasts” but what  different creature  this fierceeyed demon palpitating  life  vigor glossy  coat alert growling magnificent   dingy motheaten replicas beneath their glass cases   stuffy halls  our public museums i had never hoped or expected  see  living lion tiger or elephant—using  common terms   familiar   ancients since they seem  me less unwieldy than those now  general use among us—and so    sentiments not unmixed  awe  i stood gazing  this regal beast as above  carcass  his kill  roared out his challenge   world so enthralled  i   spectacle  i quite forgot myself   better  view him  great lion i had risen  my feet  stood not fifty paces  him  full view for  moment  did not see me his attention being directed toward  retreating elephant  i had ample time  feast my eyes upon his splendid proportions his great head  his thick black mane ah what thoughts passed through my mind  those brief moments  i stood there  rapt fascination i had come  find  wondrous civilization  instead i found  wildbeast monarch   realm where english kings had ruled a lion reigned undisturbed within  few miles   seat  one   greatest governments  world  ever known his domain  howling wilderness where yesterday fell  shadows   largest city   world it  appalling but my reflections upon this depressing subject  doomed  sudden extinction the lion had discovered me for  instant  stood silent  motionless  one   mangy effigies  home but only   instant then   most ferocious roar  without  slightest hesitancy or warning  charged upon me he forsook  prey already dead beneath him   pleasures   delectable tidbit man from  remorselessness  which  great carnivora  modern england hunted man i am constrained  believe that whatever their appetites  times past they have cultivated  gruesome taste  human flesh as i threw my rifle  my shoulder i thanked god  ancient god  my ancestors  i had replaced  hardjacketed bullets  my weapon  softnosed projectiles  though this

heart through his exposed chest or better yet  breaking his shoulder or foreleg  bringing him up long enough  pump more bullets into him  finish him i covered his left shoulder  pulled  trigger    almost upon me it stopped him with  terrific howl  pain  rage  brute rolled over  over upon  ground almost  my feet as  came i pumped two more bullets into him    struggled  rise clawing viciously  me i put  bullet  his spine that finished him  i am free  admit  i  mighty glad  it there   great tree close behind me and stepping within  shade i leaned against it wiping  perspiration  my face   day  hot   exertion  excitement left me exhausted i stood there resting   moment preparatory  turning  retracing my steps   launch when without warning something whizzed through space straight toward me there   dull thud  impact   struck  tree   i dodged  one side  turned  look   thing i saw  heavy spear imbedded   wood not three inches  where my head had been the thing had come   little  one side  me and without waiting  investigate   instant i leaped behind  tree and circling it peered around  other side  get  sight  my wouldbe murderer this time i  pitted against men—the spear told me  all too plainly—but so long  they didn’t take me unawares or  behind i had little fear  them cautiously i edged about  far side   trees until i could obtain  view   spot  which  spear must have come  when i did i saw  head   man just emerging  behind  bush the fellow  quite similar  type  those i had seen upon  isle  wight he  hairy  unkempt    finally stepped into view i saw    garbed   same primitive fashion he stood   moment gazing about  search  me  then  advanced as  did so  number  others precisely like him stepped   concealing verdure  nearby bushes  followed  his wake keeping  trees between them  me i ran back  short distance until i found  clump  underbrush  would effectually conceal me  i wished  discover  strength   party   armament before attempting  parley  it the useless destruction  any  these poor creatures   farthest idea  my mind i should have liked  have spoken  them but i did not care  risk having  use my highpowered rifle upon them other than   last extremity once  my new place  concealment i watched them  they approached  tree there  about thirty men   party  one woman—a girl whose hands seemed   bound behind her  who  being pulled along  two   men they came forward warily peering cautiously into every bush  halting often at  body   lion they paused  i could see  their gesticulations   higher pitch  their voices  they  much excited over my kill but presently they resumed their search  me   they advanced i became suddenly aware   unnecessary brutality  which  girl’s guards  treating her she stumbled once not far  my place  concealment  after  balance   party had passed me as she did so one   men  her side jerked her roughly  her feet  struck her across  mouth  his fist instantly my blood boiled  forgetting every consideration  caution i leaped  my concealment and springing   manl’s side felled him   blow so unexpected had been my act   found him  his fellow unprepared but instantly  latter drew  knife  protruded  his belt  lunged viciously  me   same time giving voice   wild cry  alarm the girl shrank back  sight  me her eyes wide  astonishment  then my antagonist  upon me i parried his first blow  my forearm   same time delivering  powerful blow  his jaw  sent him reeling back but    me again   instant though   brief interim i had time  draw my revolver i saw his companion crawling slowly  his feet   others   party racing down upon me there  no time  argue now other than   weapons we wore  so   fellow lunged  me again   wickedlooking knife i covered his heart  pulled  trigger without  sound  slipped   earth  then i turned  weapon upon  other guard who  now about  attack me he too collapsed  i  alone   astonished girl the balance   party  some twenty paces  us but coming rapidly i seized her arm  drew her after me behind  nearby tree  i had seen   both their comrades down  others  preparing  launch their spears with  girl safe behind  tree i stepped out  sight   advancing foe shouting  them  i  no enemy   they should halt  listen  me but  answer they only yelled  derision  launched  couple  spears  me both  which missed i saw then  i must fight yet still i hated  slay them    only   final resort  i dropped two  them  my rifle bringing  others   temporary halt again i appealed  them  desist but they only mistook my solicitude  them  fear and  shouts  rage  derision leaped forward once again  overwhelm me it  now quite evident  i must punish them severely or—myself—die  relinquish  girl once more  her captors neither  these things had i  slightest notion  doing  so i again stepped  behind  tree and  all  care  deliberation  target practice i commenced picking off  foremost  my assailants one  one  wild men dropped yet  came  others fierce  vengeful until only  few remaining these seemed  realize  futility  combating my modern weapon  their primitive spears and still howling wrathfully withdrew toward  west now   first time i had  opportunity  turn my attention toward  girl who had stood silent  motionless behind me  i pumped death into my enemies  hers  my automatic rifle she   medium height well formed   fine clearcut features her forehead  high  her eyes both intelligent  beautiful exposure   sun had browned  smooth  velvety skin   shade which seemed  enhance rather than mar  altogether lovely picture  youthful femininity a trace  apprehension marked her expression—i cannot call  fear since i have learned  know her—and astonishment  still apparent  her eyes she stood quite erect her hands still bound behind her  met my gaze  level proud return “what language do you speak” i asked “do you understand mine” “yes” she replied “it  similar  my own i am grabritin what  you” “i am  panamerican” i answered she shook her head “what  that” i pointed toward  west “far away across  ocean” her expression altered  trifle a slight frown contracted her brow the expression  apprehension deepened “take off your cap” she said  when  humor her strange request i did  she bid she appeared relieved then she edged  one side  leaned over seemingly  peer behind me i turned quickly  see what she discovered but finding nothing wheeled about  see  her expression  once more altered “you  not  there”  she pointed toward  east it   half question “you  not  across  water there” “no” i assured her “i am  panamerica far away   west have you ever heard  panamerica” she shook her head  negation “i do not care where you  from” she explained “if you  not  there  i am sure you  not   men  there have horns  tails” it   difficulty  i restrained  smile “who   men  there” i asked “they  bad men” she replied “some  my people do not believe  there  such creatures but we have  legend—a very old old legend  once  men  there came across  grabritin they came upon

often  led astray so numerous  varied   bypaths  speculation which lead   present day story   grabritins into  mysterious past  their forbears as i stood talking   girl i presently recollected  she still  bound    word  apology i drew my knife  cut  rawhide thongs which confined her wrists  her back she thanked me   such  sweet smile  i should have been amply repaid     much more arduous service “and now” i said “let me accompany you  your home  see you safely again under  protection  your friends” “no” she said   hint  alarm  her voice “you must not come  me—buckingham  kill you” buckingham the name  famous  ancient english history its survival  many other illustrious names  one   strongest arguments  refutal  professor cortoranl’s theory yet  opens no new doors   past and   whole rather adds  than dissipates  mystery “and who  buckingham” i asked “and why should  wish  kill me” “he would think  you had stolen me” she replied “and   wishes me  himself   kill any other whom  thinks desires me he killed wettin  few days ago my mother told me once  wettin  my father he  king now buckingham  king” here evidently   people slightly superior  those   isle  wight these must have  least  rudiments  civilized government since they recognized one among them  ruler   title king also they retained  word father the girl’s pronunciation while far  identical  ours  much closer than  tortured dialect   eastenders   isle  wight the longer i talked  her  more hopeful i became  finding here among her people some records or traditions which might assist  clearing up  historic enigma   past two centuries i asked her if we  far   city  london but she did not know what i meant when i tried  explain describing mighty buildings  stone  brick broad avenues parks palaces  countless people she but shook her head sadly “there  no such place near by” she said “only  camp   lions  places  stone where  beasts lair but there  no people   camp   lions who would dare go there” and she shuddered “the camp   lions” i repeated “and where  that  what” “it  there” she said pointing up  river toward  west “i have seen    great distance but i have never been there we  much afraid   lions  this  their country  they  angry  man  come  live here “far away there”  she pointed toward  southwest “is  land  tigers which  even worse than this  land   lions   tigers  more numerous than  lions  hungrier  human flesh there  tigers here long ago but both  lions   men set upon them  drove them off” “where did these savage beasts come from” i asked “oh” she replied “they have been here always it  their country” “do they not kill  eat your people” i asked “often when we meet them  accident  we  too few  slay them or when one goes too close  their camp but seldom do they hunt us  they find what food they need among  deer  wild cattle and too we make them gifts   we not intruders  their country really we live upon good terms  them though i should not care  meet one  there not many spears  my party” “i should like  visit this camp   lions” i said “oh no you must not” cried  girl “that would  terrible they would eat you” for  moment then she seemed lost  thought but presently she turned upon me with “you must go now  any minute buckingham may come  search  me long since should they have learned  i am gone   camp—they watch over me very closely—and they  set out after me go i shall wait here until they come  search  me” “no” i told her “i’ll not leave you alone   land infested  lions  other wild beasts if you won’t let me go  far  your camp  you then i’ll wait here until they come  search  you” “please go” she begged “you have saved me  i would save you but nothing  save you if buckingham gets his hands  you he   bad man he wishes  have me  his woman so   may  king he would kill anyone who befriended me  fear  i might become anotherl’s” “didn’t you say  buckingham  already  king” i asked “he is he took my mother  his woman after  had killed wettin but my mother  die soon—she  very old—and then  man  whom i belong  become king” finally after much questioning i got  thing through my head it appears   line  descent  through  women a man  merely head  his wife’s family—that  all if she chances    oldest female member   “royal” house   king very naively  girl explained  there  seldom any doubt   whom  childl’s mother was this accounted   girl’s importance   community   buckinghaml’s anxiety  claim her though she told me  she did not wish  become his woman     bad man  would make  bad king but   powerful  there  no other man who dared dispute his wishes “why not come  me” i suggested “if you do not wish  become buckinghaml’s” “where would you take me” she asked where indeed i had not thought  that but before i could reply  her question she shook her head  said “no i cannot leave my people i must stay  do my best even if buckingham gets me but you must go  once do not wait until   too late the lions have had no offering   long time  buckingham would seize upon  first stranger   gift  them” i did not perfectly understand what she meant   about  ask her when  heavy body leaped upon me  behind  great arms encircled my neck i struggled  free myself  turn upon my antagonist but  another instant i  overwhelmed   half dozen powerful halfnaked men while  score  others surrounded me  couple  whom seized  girl i fought  best i could  my liberty   hers but  weight  numbers  too great though i had  satisfaction  least  giving them  good fight when they had overpowered me  i stood my hands bound behind me   girl’s side she gazed commiseratingly  me “it  too bad  you did not do  i bid you” she said “for now   happened just  i feared—buckingham  you” “which  buckingham” i asked “i am buckingham” growled  burly unwashed brute swaggering truculently before me “and who  you who would have stolen my woman” the girl spoke up then  tried  explain  i had not stolen her but   contrary i had saved her   men   “elephant country” who  carrying her away buckingham only sneered  her explanation   moment later gave  command  started us all off toward  west we marched   matter   hour or so coming  last   collection  rude huts fashioned  branches  trees covered  skins  grasses  sometimes plastered  mud all about  camp they had erected  wall  saplings pointed   tops  fire hardened this palisade   protection against both man  beasts  within  dwelt upward  two thousand persons  shelters being built very close together  sometimes partially underground like deep trenches   poles  hides above merely  protection   sun  rain the older part   camp consisted almost wholly  trenches  though this had been  original form  dwellings which  slowly giving way   drier  airier surface domiciles in these trench habitations i saw  survival   military trenches which formed so famous  part   operation   warring nations during  twentieth century the women wore  single light deerskin about their hips    summer  quite warm the men too  clothed   single garment usually  pelt  some beast  prey the hair  both men  women  confined   rawhide thong passing about  forehead  tied behind in this leathern band  stuck feathers flowers or  tails  small mammals all wore necklaces   teeth or claws  wild beasts  there  numerous metal wristlets  anklets among them they wore  fact every indication   most primitive people—a race which had not yet risen   heights  agriculture or even  possession  domestic animals they  hunters—the lowest plane   evolution   human race  which science takes cognizance and yet  i looked  their well shaped heads their handsome features  their intelligent eyes   difficult  believe  i  not among my own it  only when i took into consideration their mode  living their scant apparel  lack  every least luxury among them  i  forced  admit  they were  truth but ignorant savages buckingham had relieved me  my weapons though  had not  slightest idea  their purpose or uses  when we reached  camp  exhibited both me  my arms  every indication  pride  this great capture the inhabitants flocked around me examining my clothing  exclaiming  wonderment  each new discovery  button buckle pocket  flap it seemed incredible  such  thing could be almost within  stone’s throw   spot where but  brief two centuries before had stood  greatest city   world they bound me   small tree  grew   middle  one  their crooked streets but  girl they released  soon  we had entered  enclosure the people greeted her  every mark  respect  she hastened   large hut near  center   camp presently she returned   fine looking whitehaired woman who proved   her mother the older woman carried herself   regal dignity  seemed quite remarkable   place  such primitive squalor the people fell aside  she approached making  wide way  her  her daughter when they had come near  stopped before me  older woman addressed me “my daughter  told me” she said “of  manner  which you rescued her   men   elephant country if wettin lived you would  well treated but buckingham  taken me now   king you can hope  nothing  such  beast  buckingham” the fact  buckingham stood within  pace  us    interested listener appeared not  temper her expressions   slightest “buckingham   pig” she continued “he   coward he came upon wettin  behind  ran his spear through him he  not  king  long some one  make  face  him    run away  jump into  river” the people began  titter  clap their hands buckingham became red   face it  evident    far  popular “if  dared” went   old lady “he would kill me now but  does not dare he  too great  coward if i could help you i should gladly do so but i am only queen—the vehicle   helped carry down unsullied  royal blood   days when grabritin   mighty country” the old queenl’s words had  noticeable effect upon  mob  curious savages which surrounded me the moment they discovered   old queen  friendly  me   i had rescued her daughter they commenced  accord me  more friendly interest  i heard many words spoken  my behalf  demands  made  i not  harmed but now buckingham interfered he had no intention  being robbed  his prey blustering  storming  ordered  people back  their huts   same time directing two  his warriors  confine me   dugout  one   trenches close  his own shelter here they threw me upon  ground binding my ankles together  trussing them up  my wrists behind there they left me lying upon my stomach—a most uncomfortable  strained position  which  added  pain where  cords cut into my flesh just  few days ago my mind had been filled   anticipation   friendly welcome i should find among  cultured englishmen  london today i should  sitting   place  honor   banquet board  one  londonl’s most exclusive clubs feted  lionized the actuality here i lay bound hand  foot doubtless almost upon  very site   part  ancient london yet all about me   primeval wilderness  i   captive  halfnaked wild men i wondered what had become  delcarte  taylor  snider would they search  me they could never find me i feared yet if they did what could they accomplish against this horde  savage warriors would  i could warn them i thought   girl—doubtless she could get word  them but how  i  communicate  her would she come  see me before i  killed it seemed incredible  she should not make some slight attempt  befriend me yet  i recalled she had made no effort  speak  me after we had reached  village she had hastened  her mother  moment she had been liberated though she had returned   old queen she had not spoken  me even then i began  have my doubts finally i came   conclusion  i  absolutely friendless except   old queen for some unaccountable reason my rage against  girl  her ingratitude rose  colossal proportions for  long time i waited  some one  come  my prison whom i might ask  bear word   queen but i seemed  have been forgotten the strained position  which i lay became unbearable i wriggled  twisted until i managed  turn myself partially upon my side where i lay half facing  entrance   dugout presently my attention  attracted   shadow  something moving   trench without   moment later  figure   child appeared creeping upon all fours as wideeyed  prompted  childish curiosity  little girl crawled   entrance  my hut  peered cautiously  fearfully in i did not speak  first  fear  frightening  little one away but when i  satisfied  her eyes had become sufficiently accustomed   subdued light   interior i smiled instantly  expression  fear faded  her eyes   replaced   answering smile “who  you little girl” i asked “my name  mary” she replied “i am victoryl’s sister” “and who  victory” “you do not know who victory is” she asked  astonishment i shook my head  negation “you saved her   elephant country people  yet you say you do not know her” she exclaimed “oh so she  victory  you  her sister i have not heard her name before that  why i did not know whom you meant” i explained here  just  messenger  me fate  becoming more kind “will you do something  me mary” i asked “if i can” “go  your mother  queen  ask her  come  me” i said “i have  favor  ask” she said  she would    parting smile she left me for what seemed many hours i awaited her return chafing  impatience the afternoon wore   night came  yet no one came near me my captors brought me neither food nor water i  suffering considerable pain where  rawhide thongs cut into my swollen flesh i thought  they had either forgotten me or    their intention  leave me here  die  starvation once i heard  great uproar   village men  shouting—women  screaming  moaning after  time this subsided  again there   long interval  silence half  night must have been spent when i heard  sound   trench near  hut it resembled muffled sobs presently  figure appeared silhouetted against  lesser darkness beyond  doorway it crept inside  hut “are you here” whispered  childlike voice it  mary she had returned the thongs no longer hurt me the pangs  hunger  thirst disappeared i realized   had been loneliness  which i suffered most “mary” i exclaimed “you   good girl you have come back after all i had commenced  think  you would not did you give my message   queen will she come where  she” the childl’s sobs increased  she flung herself upon  dirt floor   hut apparently overcome  grief “what  it” i asked “why do you cry” “the queen my mother  not come  you” she said between sobs “she  dead buckingham  killed her now   take victory  victory  queen he kept us fastened up  our shelter  fear  victory would escape him but i dug  hole beneath  back wall  got out i came  you because you saved victory once before  i thought  you might save her again  me also tell me  you will” “i am bound  helpless mary” i replied “otherwise i would do what i could  save you  your sister” “i  set you free” cried  girl creeping up  my side “i  set you free  then you may come  slay buckingham” “gladly” i assented “we must hurry” she went on  she fumbled   hard knots   stiffened rawhide “for buckingham   after you soon he must make  offering   lions  dawn before  can take victory the taking   queen requires  human offering” “and i am    offering” i asked “yes” she said tugging   knot “buckingham  been wanting  sacrifice ever since  killed wettin   might slay my mother  take victory” the thought  horrible not solely because   hideous fate  which i  condemned but   contemplation  engendered   sad decadence   once enlightened race to these depths  ignorance brutality  superstition had  vaunted civilization  twentieth century england been plunged   what war i felt  structure  our timehonored militaristic arguments crumbling about me mary labored   thongs  confined me they proved refractory—defying her tender childish fingers she assured me however  she would release me if “they” did not come too soon but alas they came we heard them coming down  trench  i bade mary hide   corner lest she  discovered  punished there  naught else she could do  so she crawled away into  stygian blackness behind me presently two warriors entered the leader exhibited  unique method  discovering my whereabouts   darkness he advanced slowly kicking out viciously before him finally  kicked me   face then  knew where i was a moment later i had been jerked roughly  my feet one   fellows stopped  severed  bonds  held my ankles i could scarcely stand alone the two pulled  hauled me through  low doorway  along  trench a party  forty or fifty warriors  awaiting us   brink   excavation some hundred yards   hut hands  lowered  us  we  dragged   surface then commenced  long march we stumbled through  underbrush wet  dew our way lighted   score  torchbearers who surrounded us but  torches  not  light  way—that  but incidental they  carried  keep off  huge carnivora  moaned  coughed  roared about us the noises  hideous the whole country seemed alive  lions yellowgreen eyes blazed wickedly  us  out  surrounding darkness my escort carried long heavy spears these they kept ever pointed toward  beast  prey  i learned  snatches   conversation i overheard  occasionally there might   lion who would brave even  terrors  fire  leap  upon human prey it   such   spears  always couched but nothing   sort occurred during this hideous death march    first pale heralding  dawn we reached our goal—an open place   midst   tangled wildwood here rose  crumbling grandeur  first evidences i had seen   ancient civilization which once had graced fair albion—a single timeworn arch  masonry “the entrance   camp   lions” murmured one   party   voice husky  awe here  party knelt while buckingham recited  weird prayerlike chant it  rather long  i recall only  portion  it which ran if my memory serves me somewhat  follows lord  grabritin we fall  our knees  thee this gift  bring greatest  kings  thou to thee we humbly bow peace  our camp allow god save thee king then  party rose  dragging me   crumbling arch made me fast   huge corroded copper ring which  dangling   eyebolt imbedded   masonry none  them not even buckingham seemed  feel any personal animosity toward me they  naturally rough  brutal  primitive men  supposed  have been since  dawn  humanity but they did not go out  their way  maltreat me with  coming  dawn  number  lions about us seemed  have greatly diminished—at least they made less noise—and  buckingham  his party disappeared into  woods leaving me alone  my terrible fate i could hear  grumblings  growlings   beasts diminishing   sound   chant which  party still continued it appeared   lions had failed  note  i had been left  their breakfast  had followed off after their worshippers instead but i knew  reprieve would  but   short time  though i had no wish  die i must confess  i rather wished  ordeal over   peace  oblivion upon me the voices   men   lions receded   distance until finally quiet reigned about me broken only   sweet voices  birds   sighing   summer wind   trees it seemed impossible  believe   this peaceful woodland setting  frightful thing   occur which must come   passing   next lion who chanced within sight or smell   crumbling arch i strove  tear myself loose  my bonds but succeeded only  tightening them about my arms then i remained passive   long time letting  scenes  my lifetime pass  review before my mindl’s eye i tried  imagine  astonishment incredulity  horror  which my family  friends would  overwhelmed if   instant space could  annihilated  they could see me   gates  london the gates  london where   multitude hurrying   marts  trade after  night  pleasure or rest where   clang  tramcar gongs  screech  motor horns  vast murmur   dense throng where  they and  i asked  question  lone gaunt lion strode   tangled jungle upon  far side   clearing majestically  noiselessly upon his padded feet  king  beasts moved slowly toward  gates  london  toward me was i afraid i fear  i  almost afraid i know  i thought  fear  coming  me  so i straightened up  squared my shoulders  looked  lion straight   eyes—and waited it  not  nice way  die—alone  one’s hands fast bound beneath  fangs  talons   beast  prey no   not  nice way  die not  pretty way the lion  halfway across  clearing when i heard  slight sound behind me the great cat stopped  his tracks he lashed his tail against his sides now instead  simply twitching  tip  his low moan became  thunderous roar as i craned my neck  catch  glimpse   thing  had aroused  fury   beast before me  sprang through  arched gateway    my side—with parted lips  heaving bosom  disheveled hair—a bronzed  lovely vision  eyes  had never harbored hope  rescue it  victory   her arms she clutched my rifle  revolver a long knife    doeskin belt  supported  doeskin skirt tightly about her lithe limbs she dropped my weapons  my feet and snatching  knife   resting place severed  bonds  held me i  free   lion  preparing  charge “run” i cried   girl  i bent  seized my rifle but she only stood there  my side her bared blade ready  her hand the lion  bounding toward us now  prodigious leaps i raised  rifle  fired it   lucky shot  i had no time  aim carefully  when  beast crumpled  rolled lifeless   ground i went upon my knees  gave thanks   god  my ancestors and still upon my knees i turned  taking  girl’s hand  mine i kissed it she smiled  that  laid her other hand upon my head “you have strange customs  your country” she said i could not but smile   when i thought how strange  would seem  my countrymen could they but see me kneeling there   site  london kissing  hand  englandl’s queen “and now” i said  i rose “you must return   safety  your camp i  go  you until you  near enough  continue alone  safety then i shall try  return  my comrades” “i  not return   camp” she replied “but what shall you do” i asked “i do not know only i shall never go back while buckingham lives i should rather die than go back  him mary came  me after they had taken you   camp  told me i found your strange weapons  followed  them it took me  little longer  often i had  hide   trees   lions might not get me but i came  time  now you  free  go back  your friends” “and leave you here” i exclaimed she nodded but i could see through all her brave front  she  frightened   thought i could not leave her  course but what   world i   do cumbered   care   young woman   queen  that i    loss  know i pointed out  phase    her but she only shrugged her shapely shoulders  pointed  her knife it  evident  she felt entirely competent  protect herself as we stood there we heard  sound  voices they  coming   forest through which we had passed when we had come  camp “they  searching  me” said  girl “where shall we hide” i didn’t relish hiding but when i thought   innumerable dangers which surrounded us   comparatively small amount  ammunition  i had  me i hesitated  provoke  battle  buckingham  his warriors when  flight i could avoid them  preserve my cartridges against emergencies which could not  escaped “would they follow us there” i asked pointing through  archway into  camp   lions “never” she replied “for   first place they would know  we would not dare go there    second they themselves would not dare” “then we shall take refuge   camp   lions” i said she shuddered  drew closer  me “you dare” she asked “why not” i returned “we shall  safe  buckingham  you have seen   second time  two days  lions  harmless before my weapons then too i can find my friends easiest  this direction   river thames runs through this place you call  camp   lions    farther down  thames  my friends  awaiting me do you not dare come  me” “i dare follow wherever you lead” she answered simply and so i turned  passed beneath  great arch into  city  london chapter v as we entered deeper into what had once been  city  evidences  manl’s past occupancy became more frequent for  mile   arch there  only  riot  weeds  undergrowth  trees covering small mounds  little hillocks that i  sure  formed   ruins  stately buildings   dead past but presently we came upon  district where shattered walls still raised their crumbling tops  sad silence above  grassgrown sepulchers  their fallen fellows softened  mellowed  ancient ivy stood these sentinels  sorrow their scarred faces still revealing  rents  gashes  shrapnel   bomb contrary  our expectations we found little indication  lions  any great numbers laired  this part  ancient london wellworn pathways molded  padded paws led through  cavernous windows or doorways   few   ruins we passed  once we saw  savage face   great blackmaned lion scowling down upon us   shattered stone balcony we followed down  bank   thames after we came upon it i  anxious  look  my own eyes upon  famous bridge  i guessed too   river would lead me into  part  london where stood westminster abbey   tower realizing   section through which we had been passing  doubtless outlying  therefore not so built up  large structures   more centrally located part   old town i felt sure  farther down  river i should find  ruins larger the bridge would  there  part  least  so would remain  walls  many   great edifices   past there would  no such complete ruin  large structures  i had seen among  smaller buildings but when i had come   part   city which i judged  have contained  relics i sought i found havoc  had been wrought there even greater than elsewhere at one point upon  bosom   thames there rises  few feet above  water  single disintegrating mound  masonry opposite it upon either bank   river  tumbled piles  ruins overgrown  vegetation these i am forced  believe  all  remain  london bridge  nowhere else along  river  there any other slightest sign  pier or abutment rounding  base   large pile  grasscovered debris we came suddenly upon  best preserved ruin we had yet discovered the entire lower story  part   second story  what must once have been  splendid public building rose   great knoll  shrubbery  trees while ivy thick  luxuriant clambered upward   summit   broken walls in many places  gray stone  still exposed  smoothly chiseled face pitted   scars  battle the massive portal yawned somber  sorrowful before us giving  glimpse  marble halls within the temptation  enter  too great i wished  explore  interior  this one remaining monument  civilization now dead beyond recall through this same portal within these very marble halls had gray  chamberlin  kitchener  shaw perhaps come  gone   other great ones   past i took victoryl’s hand  mine “come” i said “i do not know  name  which this great pile  known nor  purposes  fulfilled it may have been  palace  your sires victory from some great throne within your forebears may have directed  destinies  half  world come” i must confess   feeling  awe  we entered  rotunda   great building pieces  massive furniture  another day still stood where man had placed them centuries ago they  littered  dust  broken stone  plaster but otherwise so perfect  their preservation i could hardly believe  two centuries had rolled  since human eyes  last set upon them through one great room after another we wandered hand  hand while victory asked many questions    first time i began  realize something   magnificence  power   race  whose loins she had sprung splendid tapestries now mildewed  rotting hung upon  walls there  mural paintings too depicting great historic events   past for  first time victory saw  likeness   horse  she  much affected   huge oil which depicted some ancient cavalry charge against  battery  field guns in other pictures there  steamships battleships submarines  quaint looking railway trains—all small  antiquated  appearance  me but wonderful  victory she told me  she would like  remain   rest  her life where she could look  those pictures daily from room  room we passed until presently we emerged into  mighty chamber dark  gloomy   high  narrow windows  choked  clogged  ivy along one paneled wall we groped our eyes slowly becoming accustomed   darkness a rank  pungent odor pervaded  atmosphere we had made our way about half  distance across one end   great apartment when  low growl   far end brought us   startled halt straining my eyes through  gloom i made out  raised dais   extreme opposite end   hall upon  dais stood two great chairs highbacked   great arms the throne  england but what  those strange forms about it victory gave my hand  quick excited little squeeze “the lions” she whispered yes lions indeed sprawled about  dais   dozen huge forms while upon  seat  one   thrones  small cub lay curled  slumber as we stood there   moment spellbound   sight  those fearsome creatures occupying  very thrones   sovereigns  england  low growl  repeated   great male rose slowly  his feet his devilish eyes bored straight through  semidarkness toward us he had discovered  interloper what right had man within this palace   beasts again  opened his giant jaws  this time there rumbled forth  warning roar instantly eight or ten   other beasts leaped  their feet already  great fellow who had spied us  advancing slowly  our direction i held my rifle ready but how futile  appeared   face  this savage horde the foremost beast broke into  slow trot   his heels came  others all  roaring now   din  their great voices reverberating through  halls  corridors   palace formed  most frightful chorus  thunderous savagery imaginable   mind  man and then  leader charged  upon  hideous pandemonium broke  sharp crack  my rifle once twice thrice three lions rolled struggling  biting   floor victory seized my arm   quick “this way here   door”   moment later we    tiny antechamber   foot   narrow stone staircase up this we backed victory just behind me   first   remaining lions leaped   throne room  sprang   stairs again i fired but others   ferocious beasts leaped over their fallen fellows  pursued us the stairs  very narrow—that  all  saved us—for  i backed slowly upward but  single lion could attack me   time   carcasses  those i slew impeded  rushes   others at last we reached  top there   long corridor  which opened many doorways one directly behind us  tight closed if we could open   pass into  chamber behind we might find  respite  attack the remaining lions  roaring horribly i saw one sneaking very slowly up  stairs toward us “try  door” i called  victory “see if   open” she ran up    pushed “turn  knob” i cried seeing  she did not know how  open  door but neither did she know what i meant  knob i put  bullet   spine   approaching lion  leaped  victoryl’s side the door resisted my first efforts  swing  inward rusted hinges  swollen wood held  tightly closed but  last  gave  just  another lion mounted   top   stairway  swung in  i pushed victory across  threshold then i turned  meet  renewed attack   savage foe one lion fell  his tracks another stumbled  my very feet  then i leaped within  slammed  portal to a quick glance showed me  this   only door   small apartment  which we had found sanctuary and   sigh  relief i leaned   moment against  panels   stout barrier  separated us   ramping demons without across  room between two windows stood  flattopped desk a little pile  white  brown lay upon  close   opposite edge after  moment  rest i crossed  room  investigate the white   bleached human bones—the skull collar bones arms   few   upper ribs   man the brown   dust   decayed military cap  blouse in  chair before  desk  other bones while more still strewed  floor beneath  desk  about  chair a man had died sitting there  his face buried  his arms—two hundred years ago beneath  desk   pair  spurred military boots green  rotten  decay in them   leg bones   man among  tiny bones   hands   ancient fountain pen  good apparently   day   made   metal covered memoranda book closed over  bones   index finger it   gruesome sight—a pitiful sight—this lone inhabitant  mighty london i picked up  metal covered memoranda book its pages  rotten  stuck together only here  there   sentence or  part   sentence legible the first  i could read  near  middle   little volume “his majesty left  tunbridge wells today   jesty  stricken  terday god give she does not die  am military governor  lon ” and farther on “it  awful  hundred deaths today  worse than  bombardm ” nearer  end i picked out  following “i promised his maj  e  find me here when  ret  alone” the most legible passage    next page “thank god we drove them out there  not  single  man  british soil today but  what awful cost i tried  persuade sir phillip  urge  people  remain but they  mad  fear   death  rage  our enemies he tells me   coast cities  packed  waiting   taken across what  become  england  none left  rebuild her shattered cities” and  last entry “ alone only  wild beasts  a lion  roaring now beneath  palace

him some   entries had been dated from  few legible letters  figures which remained i judge  end came some time  august  but   i am not  all certain the diary  cleared up  least one mystery  had puzzled me not  little  now i am surprised  i had not guessed  solution myself—the presence  african  asiatic beasts  england acclimated  years  confinement   zoological gardens they  fitted  resume  england  wild existence  which nature had intended them  once free had evidently bred prolifically  marked contrast   captive exotics  twentieth century panamerica which had gradually become fewer until extinction occurred some time during  twentyfirst century the palace if such  was lay not far   banks   thames the room  which we  imprisoned overlooked  river  i determined  attempt  escape  this direction to descend through  palace  out   question but outside we could discover no lions the stems   ivy which clambered upward past  window   room   large around  my arm i knew  they would support our weight   we could gain nothing  remaining longer   palace i decided  descend  way   ivy  follow along down  river   direction   launch naturally i  much handicapped   presence   girl but i could not abandon her though i had no idea what i should do  her after rejoining my companions that she would prove  burden   embarrassment i  certain but she had made  equally plain  me  she would never return  her people  mate  buckingham i owed my life  her and all other considerations aside   sufficient demand upon my gratitude  my honor  necessitate my suffering every inconvenience  her service too she  queen  england but  far  most potent argument  her favor she   woman  distress—and  young  very beautiful one and so though i wished  thousand times  she  back  her camp i never let her guess it but did all  lay within my power  serve  protect her i thank god now  i did so with  lions still padding back  forth beyond  closed door victory  i crossed  room  one   windows i had outlined my plan  her  she had assured me  she could descend  ivy without assistance in fact she smiled  trifle  my question swinging myself outward i began  descent  had come  within  few feet   ground being just opposite  narrow window when i  startled   savage growl almost  my ear  then  great taloned paw darted   aperture  seize me  i saw  snarling face   lion within  embrasure releasing my hold upon  ivy i dropped  remaining distance   ground saved  laceration only because  lionl’s paw struck  thick stem  ivy the creature  making  frightful racket now leaping back  forth   floor   broad window ledge tearing   masonry  his claws  vain attempts  reach me but  opening  too narrow   masonry too solid victory had commenced  descent but i called  her  stop just above  window and   lion reappeared growling  snarling i put   bullet  his face    same moment victory slipped quickly past him dropping into my upraised arms   awaiting her the roaring   beasts  had discovered us together   report  my rifle had set  balance   fierce inmates   palace into  most frightful uproar i have ever heard i feared   would not  long before intelligence or instinct would draw them   interiors  set them upon our trail  river nor had we much more than reached  when  lion bounded around  corner   edifice we had just quitted  stood looking about  though  search  us following came others while victory  i crouched  hiding behind  clump  bushes close   bank   river the beasts sniffed about  ground   while but they did not chance  go near  spot where we had stood beneath  window  had given us escape presently  blackmaned male raised his head and  cocked ears  glaring eyes gazed straight   bush behind which we lay i could have sworn   had discovered us  when  took  few short  stately steps  our direction i raised my rifle  covered him but after  long tense moment  looked away  turned  glare  another direction i breathed  sigh  relief  so did victory i could feel her body quiver  she lay pressed close  me our cheeks almost touching  we both peered through  same small opening   foliage i turned  give her  reassuring smile   lion indicated   had not seen us   i did so she too turned her face toward mine   same purpose doubtless anyway  our heads turned simultaneously our lips brushed together a startled expression came into victoryl’s eyes  she drew back  evident confusion as  me  strangest sensation  i have ever experienced claimed me   instant a peculiar tingling thrill ran through my veins  my head swam i could not account  it naturally being  naval officer  consequently   best society   federation i have seen much  women with others i have laughed   assertions   savants  modern man   cold  passionless creation  comparison   males  former ages—in  word  love   one grand passion had ceased  exist i do not know now but  they  more nearly right than we have guessed  least  so far  modern civilized woman  concerned i have kissed many women—young  beautiful  middle aged  old  many  i had no business kissing—but never before had i experienced  remarkable  altogether delightful thrill  followed  accidental brushing  my lips against  lips  victory the occurrence interested me  i  tempted  experiment further but when i would have essayed  another new  entirely unaccountable force restrained me for  first time  my life i felt embarrassment   presence   woman what further might have developed i cannot say    moment  perfect shedevil   lioness  keener eyes than her lord  master discovered us she came trotting toward our place  concealment growling  baring her yellow fangs i waited   instant hoping  i might  mistaken   she would turn off  some other direction but no—she increased her trot   gallop  then i fired  her but  bullet though  struck her full   breast didn’t stop her screaming  pain  rage  creature fairly flew toward us behind her came other lions our case looked hopeless we  upon  brink   river there seemed no avenue  escape  i knew  even my modern automatic rifle  inadequate   face  so many  these fierce beasts to remain where we  would have been suicidal we  both standing now victory keeping her place bravely  my side when i reached  only decision open  me seizing  girl’s hand i turned just   lioness crashed into  opposite side   bushes and dragging victory after me leaped over  edge   bank into  river i did not know  lions  not fond  water nor did i know if victory could swim but death immediate  terrible stared us   face if we remained  so i took  chance at this point  current ran close   shore so  we  immediately  deep water and  my intense satisfaction victory struck out   strong overhand stroke  set all my fears  her account  rest but my relief  shortlived that lioness  i have said before   veritable devil she stood   moment glaring  us then like  shot she sprang into  river  swam swiftly after us victory   length ahead  me “swim   other shore” i called  her i  much impeded  my rifle having  swim  one hand while i clung  my precious weapon   other the girl had seen  lioness take   water  she had also seen  i  swimming much more slowly than she  what did she do she started  drop back  my side “go on” i cried “make   other shore  then follow down until you find my friends tell them  i sent you   orders  they   protect you go on go on” but she only waited until we  again swimming side  side  i saw  she had drawn her long knife   holding  between her teeth “do  i tell you” i said  her sharply but she shook her head the lioness  overhauling us rapidly she  swimming silently her chin just touching  water but blood  streaming  between her lips it  evident  her lungs  pierced she  almost upon me i saw    moment she would take me under her forepaws or seize me  those great jaws i felt  my time had come but i meant  die fighting and so i turned and treading water raised my rifle above my head  awaited her victory animated   bravery no less ferocious than    dumb beast assailing us swam straight  me it all happened so swiftly  i cannot recall  details   kaleidoscopic action which ensued i knew  i rose high out   water and  clubbed rifle dealt  animal  terrific blow upon  skull  i saw victory her long blade flashing  her hand close striking upon  beast   great paw fell upon her shoulder   i  swept beneath  surface   water like  straw before  prow   freighter still clinging  my rifle i rose again  see  lioness struggling  her death throes but  arml’s length  me scarcely had i risen than  beast turned upon her side struggled frantically   instant  then sank chapter vi victory  nowhere  sight alone i floated upon  bosom   thames in  brief instant i believe  i suffered more mental anguish than i have crowded into all  balance  my life before or since a few hours before i had been wishing  i might  rid  her  now  she  gone i would have given my life  have her back again wearily i turned  swim about  spot where she had disappeared hoping  she might rise once  least  i would  given  opportunity  save her and  i turned  water boiled before my face  her head shot up before me i    point  striking out  seize her when  happy smile illumined her features “you  not dead” she cried “i have been searching  bottom  you i  sure   blow she gave you must have disabled you”  she glanced about   lioness “she  gone” she asked “dead” i replied “the blow you struck her   thing you call rifle stunned her” she explained “and then i swam  close enough  get my knife into her heart” ah such  girl i could not but wonder what one  our own panamerican women would have done under like circumstances but then  course they have not been trained  stern necessity  cope   emergencies  dangers  savage primeval life along  bank we had just quitted  score  lions paced   fro growling menacingly we could not return  we struck out   opposite shore i am  strong swimmer  had no doubt   my ability  cross  river but i  not so sure about victory so i swam close behind her   ready  give her assistance should she need it she did not however reaching  opposite bank  fresh apparently  when she entered  water victory   wonder each day  we  together brought new proofs  it nor   her courage or vitality only which amazed me she had  head  those shapely shoulders  hers  dignity my but she could  regal when she chose she told me   lions  fewer upon this side   river but  there  many wolves running  great packs later   year now they  north somewhere  we should have little  fear  them though we might meet   few my first concern   take my weapons apart  dry them which  rather difficult   face   fact  every rag about me  drenched but finally thanks   sun  much rubbing i succeeded though i had no oil  lubricate them we ate some wild berries  roots  victory found  then we set off again down  river keeping  eye open  game  one side   launch   other  i thought  delcarte who would   natural leader during my absence might run up  thames  search  me the balance   day we sought  vain  game or   launch  when night came we lay down our stomachs empty  sleep beneath  stars we  entirely unprotected  attack  wild beasts   this reason i remained awake most   night  guard but nothing approached us though i could hear  lions roaring across  river  once i thought i heard  howl   beast north  us—it might have been  wolf altogether    most unpleasant night  i determined then  if we  forced  sleep out again  i should provide some sort  shelter which would protect us  attack while we slept toward morning i dozed   sun  well up when victory aroused me  gently shaking my shoulder “antelope” she whispered  my ear and  i raised my head she pointed upriver crawling  my knees i looked   direction she indicated  see  buck standing upon  little knoll some two hundred yards  us there  good cover between  animal  me  so though i might have hit him  two hundred yards i preferred  crawl closer  him  make sure   meat we both so craved i had covered about fifty yards   distance   beast  still feeding peacefully so i thought  i would make even surer   hit  going ahead another fifty yards when  animal suddenly raised his head  looked away upriver his whole attitude proclaimed    startled  something beyond him  i could not see realizing   might break  run   i should then probably miss him entirely i raised my rifle  my shoulder but even  i did so  animal leaped into  air  simultaneously there   sound   shot  beyond  knoll for  instant i  dumbfounded had  report come  downriver i should have instantly thought  one  my own men had fired but coming  upriver  puzzled me considerably who could there   firearms  primitive england other than we   coldwater victory  directly behind me  i motioned  her  lie down  i did behind  bush  which i had been upon  point  firing   antelope we could see   buck  quite dead   our hiding place we waited  discover  identity  his slayer when  latter should approach  claim his kill we had not long  wait  when i saw  head  shoulders   man appear above  crest   knoll i sprang  my feet   heartfelt cry  joy    delcarte at  sound  my voice delcarte half raised his rifle  readiness   attack   enemy but  moment later  recognized me   coming rapidly  meet us behind him  snider they both  astounded  see me upon  north bank   river  much more so   sight  my companion then i introduced them  victory  told them  she  queen  england they thought  first  i  joking but when i had recounted my adventures  they realized  i   earnest they believed me they told me  they had followed me inshore when i had not returned   hunt  they had met  men   elephant country  had had  short  onesided battle   fellows and  afterward they had returned   launch   prisoner  whom they had learned  i had probably been captured   men   lion country with  prisoner   guide they had set off upriver  search  me but had been much delayed  motor trouble  had finally camped after dark  half mile above  spot where victory  i had spent  night they must have passed us   dark  why i did not hear  sound   propeller i do not know unless  passed me   time when  lions  making  unusually earsplitting din upon  opposite side taking  antelope  us we all returned   launch where we found taylor  delighted  see me alive again  delcarte had been i cannot say truthfully  snider evinced much enthusiasm  my rescue taylor had found  ingredients  chemical fuel   distilling  them had   motor trouble accounted  their delay  setting out after me the prisoner  delcarte  snider had taken   powerful young fellow   elephant country notwithstanding  fact  they had all assured him   contrary  still could not believe  we would not kill him he assured us  his name  thirtysix and   could not count above ten i am sure   had no conception   correct meaning   word    may have been handed down  him either   military number   ancestor who had served   english ranks during  great war or  originally    number  some famous regiment  which  forbear fought now  we  reunited we held  council  determine what course we should pursue   immediate future snider  still  setting out  sea  returning  panamerica but  better judgment  delcarte  taylor ridiculed  suggestion—we should not have lived  fortnight to remain  england constantly menaced  wild beasts  men equally  wild seemed about  bad i suggested  we cross  channel  ascertain if we could not discover  more enlightened  civilized people upon  continent i  sure  some trace   ancient culture  greatness  europe must remain germany probably would  much    during  twentieth century for  common  most panamericans i  positive  germany had been victorious   great war snider demurred   suggestion he said    bad enough  have come this far he did not want  make  worse  going   continent the outcome     i finally lost my patience  told him   then   would do what i thought best—that i proposed  assume command   party   they might all consider themselves under my orders  much so  though we  still aboard  coldwater   panamerican waters delcarte  taylor immediately assured me  they had not   instant assumed anything different   they   ready  follow  obey me here  they would  upon  other side  thirty snider said nothing but  wore  sullen scowl and i wished then  i had before   i did   much greater extent later  fate had not decreed   should have chanced    member   launchl’s party upon  memorable day when last we quitted  coldwater victory who  given  voice  our councils  all  going   continent or anywhere else  fact where she might see new sights  experience new adventures “afterward we can come back  grabritin” she said “and if buckingham  not dead  we can catch him away  his men  kill him then i can return  my people  we can all live  peace  happiness” she spoke  killing buckingham  no greater concern than one might evince   contemplated destruction   sheep yet she  neither cruel nor vindictive in fact victory   very sweet  womanly woman but human life   small account beyond thirty—a legacy   bloody days when thousands  men perished   trenches between  rising   setting   sun when they laid them lengthwise  these same trenches  sprinkled dirt over them when  germans corded their corpses like wood  set fire  them when women  children  old men  butchered  great passenger ships  torpedoed without warning thirtysix finally assured  we did not intend slaying him   keen  accompany us   victory the crossing   continent  uneventful  monotony being relieved however   childish delight  victory  thirtysix   novel experience  riding safely upon  bosom   water   being so far  land with  possible exception  snider  little party appeared   best  spirits laughing  joking or interestedly discussing  possibilities which  future held  us what we should find upon  continent  whether  inhabitants would  civilized or barbarian peoples victory asked me  explain  difference between  two  when i had tried  do so  clearly  possible she broke into  gay little laugh “oh” she cried “then i am  barbarian” i could not but laugh too  i admitted  she was indeed  barbarian she  not offended taking  matter   huge joke but some time thereafter she sat  silence apparently deep  thought finally she looked up  me her strong white teeth gleaming behind her smiling lips “should you take  thing you call ‘razor’” she said “and cut  hair   face  thirtysix  exchange garments  him you would   barbarian  thirtysix  civilized man there  no other difference between you except your weapons clothe you   wolfskin give you  knife   spear  set you down   woods  grabritin—of what service would your civilization   you” delcarte  taylor smiled  her reply but thirtysix  snider laughed uproariously i  not surprised  thirtysix but i thought  snider laughed louder than  occasion warranted as  matter  fact snider  seemed  me  taking advantage  every opportunity however slight  show insubordination  i determined then    first real breach  discipline i should take action  would remind snider ever after  i  still his commanding officer i could not help but notice  his eyes  much upon victory  i did not like it  i knew  type  man  was but   would not  necessary ever  leave  girl alone  him i felt no apprehension  her safety after  incident   discussion  barbarians i thought  victoryl’s manner toward me changed perceptibly she held aloof  me  when snider took his turn   wheel sat beside him upon  pretext  she wished  learn how  steer  launch i wondered if she had guessed  manl’s antipathy  me   seeking his company solely   purpose  piquing me snider was too taking full advantage  his opportunity often  leaned toward  girl  whisper  her ear   laughed much which  unusual  snider of course   nothing  all  me yet  some unaccountable reason  sight   two  them sitting there so close  one another  seeming   enjoying each otherl’s society  such  degree irritated me tremendously  put me  such  bad humor  i took no pleasure whatsoever   last few hours   crossing we aimed  land near  site  ancient ostend but when we neared  coast we discovered no indication  any human habitations whatever let alone  city after we had landed we found  same howling wilderness about us  we had discovered   british isle there  no slightest indication  civilized man had ever set  foot upon  portion   continent  europe although i had feared  much since our experience  england i could not but own   feeling  marked disappointment    gravest fears   future which induced  mental depression    no way dissipated   continued familiarity between victory  snider i  angry  myself  i permitted  matter  affect me   had i did not wish  admit  myself  i  angry  this uncultured little savage   made  slightest difference  me what she did or what she did not do or  i could so lower myself   feel personal enmity towards  common sailor and yet   honest i  doing both finding nothing  detain us about  spot where ostend once had stood we set out up  coast  search   mouth   river rhine which i purposed ascending  search  civilized man it  my intention  explore  rhine  far up   launch would take us if we found no civilization there we would return   north sea continue up  coast   elbe  follow  river   canals  berlin here  least i  sure  we should find what we sought—and if not then all europe had reverted  barbarism the weather remained fine  we made excellent progress but everywhere along  rhine we met   same disappointment—no sign  civilized man  fact no sign  man  all i  not enjoying  exploration  modern europe  i had anticipated—i  unhappy victory seemed changed too i had enjoyed her company  first but since  trip across  channel i had held aloof  her her chin    air most   time  yet i rather think  she regretted her friendliness  snider  i noticed  she avoided him entirely he   contrary emboldened  her former friendliness sought every opportunity   near her i should have liked nothing better than  reasonably good excuse  punch his head yet paradoxically i  ashamed  myself  harboring him any ill will i realized  there  something  matter  me but i did not know what  was matters remained thus  several days  we continued our journey up  rhine at cologne i had hoped  find some reassuring indications but there  no cologne and  there had been no other cities along  river up   point  devastation  infinitely greater than time alone could have wrought great guns bombs  mines must have leveled every building  man had raised  then nature unhindered had covered  ghastly evidence  human depravity  her beauteous mantle  verdure splendid trees reared their stately tops where splendid cathedrals once had reared their domes  sweet wild flowers blossomed  simple serenity  soil  once  drenched  human blood nature had reclaimed what man had once stolen  her  defiled a herd  zebras grazed where once  german kaiser may have reviewed his troops an antelope rested peacefully   bed  daisies where perhaps two hundred years ago  big gun belched  terrorladen messages  death  hate  destruction against  works  man  god alike we   need  fresh meat yet i hesitated  shatter  quiet  peaceful serenity   view   crack   rifle   death  one  those beautiful creatures before us but  had   done—we must eat i left  work  delcarte however    moment we had two antelope   landscape  ourselves after eating we boarded  launch  continued up  river for two days we passed through  primeval wilderness in  afternoon   second day we landed upon  west bank   river and leaving snider  thirtysix  guard victory   launch delcarte taylor  i set out after game we tramped away   river  upwards   hour before discovering anything  then only  small red deer which taylor brought down   neat shot  two hundred yards it  getting too late  proceed farther so we rigged  sling   two men carried  deer back toward  launch while i walked  hundred yards ahead   hope  bagging something further  our larder we had covered about half  distance   river when i suddenly came face  face   man he   primitive  uncouth  appearance   grabritins—a shaggy unkempt savage clothed   shirt  skin cured   head on  latter surmounting his own head  form  bonnet  giving  him  most fearful  ferocious aspect the fellow  armed   long spear   club  latter dangling down his back   leathern thong about his neck his feet  incased  hide sandals at sight  me  halted   instant then turned  dove into  forest and though i called reassuringly  him  english  did not return nor did i again see him the sight   wild man raised my hopes once more  elsewhere we might find men   higher state  civilization—it   society  civilized man  i craved—and so   lighter heart i continued  toward  river   launch i  still some distance ahead  delcarte  taylor when i came  sight   rhine again but i came   waterl’s edge before i noticed  anything  amiss   party we had left there  few hours before my first intimation  disaster   absence   launch   former moorings and then  moment later—i discovered  body   man lying upon  bank running toward it i saw    thirtysix   i stopped  raised  grabritinl’s head  my arms i heard  faint moan break  his lips he  not dead but    badly injured  all too evident delcarte  taylor came up  moment later   three  us worked over  fellow hoping  revive him   might tell us what had happened  what had become   others my first thought  prompted   sight i had recently had   savage native the little party had evidently been surprised    attack thirtysix had been wounded   others taken prisoners the thought  almost like  physical blow   face—it stunned me victory   hands  these abysmal brutes it  frightful i almost shook poor thirtysix  my efforts  revive him i explained my theory   others  then delcarte shattered    single movement   hand he drew aside  lionl’s skin  covered half   grabritinl’s breast revealing  neat round hole  thirtysixl’s chest—a hole  could have been made  no other weapon than  rifle “snider” i exclaimed delcarte nodded at about  same time  eyelids   wounded man fluttered  raised he looked up  us  very slowly  light  consciousness returned  his eyes “what happened thirtysix” i asked him he tried  reply but  effort caused him  cough bringing about  hemorrhage   lungs  again  fell back exhausted for several long minutes  lay  one dead then   almost inaudible whisper  spoke “snider—” he paused tried  speak again raised  hand  pointed downriver “they—went—back”  then  shuddered convulsively  died none  us voiced his belief but i think they  all alike victory  snider had stolen  launch  deserted us chapter vii we stood there grouped about  body   dead grabritin looking futilely down  river  where  made  abrupt curve   west  quarter   mile below us   lost  sight  though we expected  see  truant returning  us  our precious launch—the thing  meant life or death  us  this unfriendly savage world i felt rather than saw taylor turn his eyes slowly toward my profile and  mine swung  meet them  expression upon his face recalled me  my duty  responsibility   officer the utter hopelessness   reflected  his face must have been  counterpart  what i myself felt but   brief instant i determined  hide my own misgivings  i might bolster up  courage   others “we  lost”  written  plainly upon taylorl’s face  though his features   printed words upon  open book he  thinking   launch    launch alone was i i tried  think  i was but  greater grief than  loss   launch could have engendered  me filled my heart—a sullen gnawing misery which i tried  deny—which i refused  admit—but which persisted  obsessing me until my heart rose  filled my throat  i could not speak when i would have uttered words  reassurance  my companions and then rage came  my relief—rage against  vile traitor who had deserted three  his fellow countrymen  so frightful  position i tried  feel  equal rage against  woman but somehow i could not  kept searching  excuses  her—her youth her inexperience her savagery my rising anger swept away my temporary helplessness i smiled  told taylor not  look so glum “we  follow them” i said “and  chances   we shall overtake them they  not travel  rapidly  snider probably hopes he   forced  halt  fuel   food   launch must follow  windings   river we can take short cuts while they  traversing  detour i have my map—thank god i always carry  upon my person—and     compass we  have  advantage over them” my words seemed  cheer them both  they   starting off  once  pursuit there  no reason why we should delay  we set forth down  river as we tramped along we discussed  question   uppermost   mind  each—what we should do  snider when we had captured him    action  pursuit had come  optimistic conviction  we should succeed as  matter  fact we had  succeed the very thought  remaining  this utter wilderness   rest  our lives  impossible we arrived  nothing very definite   matter  sniderl’s punishment since taylor   shooting him delcarte insisting   should  hanged while i although fully conscious   gravity  his offense could not bring myself  give  death penalty i fell  wondering what charm victory had found  such  man  snider  why i insisted upon finding excuses  her  trying  defend her indefensible act she  nothing  me aside   natural gratitude i felt  her since she had saved my life i owed her nothing she   halfnaked little savage—i  gentleman   officer   worldl’s greatest navy there could  no close bonds  interest between us this line  reflection i discovered    distressing   former but though i tried  turn my mind  other things  persisted  returning   vision   oval face suntanned  smiling lips revealing white  even teeth  brave eyes  harbored no shadow  guile    tumbling mass  wavy hair  crowned  loveliest picture  which my eyes had ever rested every time this vision presented itself i felt myself turn cold  rage  hate against snider i could forgive  launch but if  had wronged her  should die—he should die  my own hands  this i  determined for two days we followed  river northward cutting off where we could but confined   most part   game trails  paralleled  stream one afternoon we cut across  narrow neck  land  saved us many miles where  river wound   west  back again here we decided  halt  we had had  hard day  it and if  truth  known i think  we had all given up hope  overtaking  launch other than   merest accident we had shot  deer just before our halt and  taylor  delcarte  preparing it i walked down   water  fill our canteens i had just finished   straightening up when something floating around  bend above me caught my eye for  moment i could not believe  testimony  my own senses it   boat i shouted  delcarte  taylor who came running  my side “the launch” cried delcarte and indeed    launch floating downriver  above us where had  been how had we passed it and how  we  reach  now should snider   girl discover us “itl’s drifting” said taylor “i see no one  it” i  stripping off my clothes  delcarte soon followed my example i told taylor  remain  shore   clothing  rifles he might also serve us better there since  would give him  opportunity  take  shot  snider should  man discover us  show himself with powerful strokes we swam out   path   oncoming launch being  stronger swimmer than delcarte i soon  far   lead reaching  center   channel just   launch bore down upon me it  drifting broadside on i seized  gunwale  raised myself quickly so  my chin topped  side i expected  blow  moment  i came within  view   occupants but no blow fell snider lay upon his back   bottom   boat alone even before i had clambered   stooped above him i knew    dead without examining him further i ran forward   control board  pressed  starting button to my relief  mechanism responded—the launch  uninjured coming about i picked up delcarte he  astounded   sight  met his eyes  immediately fell  examining sniderl’s body  signs  life or  explanation   manner  which  met his death the fellow had been dead  hours—he  cold  still but delcarte’s search  not without results  above sniderl’s heart   wound  slit about  inch  length—such  slit   sharp knife would make    dead fingers  one hand  clutched  strand  long brown hair—victoryl’s hair  brown they say  dead men tell no tales but snider told  story  his end  clearly  though  dead lips had parted  poured forth  truth the beast had attacked  girl  she had defended her honor we buried snider beside  rhine  no stone marks his last resting place beasts do not require headstones then we set out   launch turning her nose upstream when i had told delcarte  taylor  i intended searching   girl neither had demurred “we had her wrong  our thoughts” said delcarte “and  least  we can do  expiation   find  rescue her” we called her name aloud every few minutes  we motored up  river but though we returned all  way  our former camping place we did not find her i then decided  retrace our journey letting taylor handle  launch while delcarte  i upon opposite sides   river searched  some sign   spot where victory had landed we found nothing until we had reached  point  few miles above  spot where i had first seen  launch drifting down toward us  there i discovered  remnants   recent camp fire that victory carried flint  steel i  aware     she who built  fire i  positive but which way had she gone since she stopped here would she go  down  river  she might thus bring herself nearer her own grabritin or would she have sought  search  us upstream where she had seen us last i had hailed taylor  sent him across  river  take  delcarte   two might join me  discuss my discovery  our future plans while waiting  them i stood looking out over  river my back toward  woods  stretched away   east behind me delcarte  just stepping into  launch upon  opposite side   stream when without  least warning i  violently seized  both arms  about  waist—three or four men  upon me  once my rifle  snatched  my hands  my revolver  my belt i struggled   instant but finding my efforts  no avail i ceased them  turned my head  have  look  my assailants at  same time several others  them walked around  front  me and  my astonishment i found myself looking upon uniformed soldiery armed  rifles revolvers  sabers but  faces  black  coal chapter viii delcarte  taylor  now  midstream coming toward us  i called  them  keep aloof until i knew whether  intentions  my captors  friendly or otherwise my good men wanted  come   annihilate  blacks but there  upward   hundred   latter all well armed  so i commanded delcarte  keep out  harml’s way  stay where   till i needed him a young officer called  beckoned  them but they refused  come  so  gave orders  resulted  my hands being secured  my back after which  company marched away straight toward  east i noticed   men wore spurs which seemed strange  me but when late   afternoon we arrived  their encampment i discovered  my captors  cavalrymen in  center   plain stood  log fort   blockhouse  each   four corners as we approached i saw  herd  cavalry horses grazing under guard outside  walls   post they  small stocky horses but  telltale saddle galls proclaimed their calling the

addressed me     language  foreign  me      blacks at last  old officer gave  up and shaking his head gave instructions  my removal from his office i  led   guardhouse  which i found about fifty halfnaked whites clad   skins  wild beasts i tried  converse  them but not one  them could understand panamerican nor could i make head or tail  their jargon for over  month i remained  prisoner there working  morning until night  odd jobs about  headquarters building   commanding officer the other prisoners worked harder than i did  i owe my better treatment solely   kindliness  discrimination   old colonel what had become  victory  delcarte  taylor i could not know nor did  seem likely  i should ever learn i  most depressed but i whiled away my time  performing  duties given me   best  my ability  attempting  learn  language  my captors who they  or where they came    mystery  me that they   outpost  some powerful black nation seemed likely yet where  seat   nation lay i could not guess they looked upon  whites  their inferiors  treated us accordingly they had  literature  their own  many   men even  common soldiers  omnivorous readers every two weeks  dustcovered trooper would

their tongue so  i could understand what  said before me  make myself understood i had seen   first  i  being treated   slave—that all whites  fell into  hands   blacks  thus treated almost daily new

his side the latter stepped toward me  motioned me  follow him i did so   led back   colonel by this time i could understand  few words  their strange language  when  colonel asked me if i would prefer  remain   post  his body servant i signified my willingness  emphatically  possible  i had seen enough   brutality   common soldiers toward their white slaves  have no desire  start out upon

apparent   black race  thrived far better   past two centuries under men   own color than  had under  domination  whites during all previous history i had been  prisoner   little frontier post  over  month when orders came  colonel belik  hasten   eastern frontier   major portion  his command leaving only one troop  garrison  fort as his body servant i accompanied him mounted upon  fiery little abyssinian pony we marched rapidly  ten days through  heart   ancient german empire halting when night found us  proximity  water often we passed small posts similar    which  colonel’s regiment had been quartered finding  each instance  only  single company or troop remained  defence  balance having been withdrawn toward  northeast   same direction  which we  moving naturally  colonel had not confided  me  nature  his orders but  rapidity  our march   fact  all available troops  being hastened toward  northeast assured me   matter  vital importance   dominion  menelek xiv   part  europe  threatening or had already broken i could not believe   simple rising   savage tribes  whites would necessitate  mobilizing  such  force  we presently met  converging   south into our trail there  large bodies  cavalry  infantry endless streams  artillery wagons  guns  countless horsedrawn covered vehicles laden  camp equipage munitions  provisions here   first time i saw camels great caravans  them bearing all sorts  heavy burdens  miles upon miles  elephants doing similar service it   scene  wondrous  barbaric splendor   men  beasts   south  gaily caparisoned  rich colors  marked contrast   gray uniformed forces   frontier  which i had been familiar the rumor reached us  menelek himself  coming   pitch  excitement  which this announcement raised  troops  little short  miraculous—at least  one  my race  nationality whose rulers  centuries had been but ordinary men holding office      people   few brief years as i witnessed it i could not but speculate upon  moral effect upon his troops   sovereignl’s presence   midst  battle all else being equal  war between  troops   republic   empire could not this exhilarated mental state amounting almost  hysteria   part   imperial troops weigh heavily against  soldiers   president i wonder but if  emperor chanced   absent what then again i wonder on  eleventh day we reached our destination—a walled frontier city  about twenty thousand we passed some lakes  crossed some old canals before entering  gates within beside  frame buildings  many built  ancient brick  wellcut stone these i  told   material taken   ruins   ancient city which once had stood upon  site   present town the name   town translated   abyssinian  new gondar it stands i am convinced upon  ruins  ancient berlin  one time capital   old german empire but except   old building material used   new town there  no sign   former city the day after we arrived  town  gaily decorated  flags streamers gorgeous rugs  banners   rumor had proved true—the emperor  coming colonel belik had accorded me  greatest liberty permitting me  go where i pleased after my few duties had been performed as  result  his kindness i spent much time wandering about new gondar talking   inhabitants  exploring  city  black men as i had been given  semimilitary uniform which bore insignia indicating  i   officerl’s body servant even  blacks treated me   species  respect though i could see  their manner  i  really   dirt beneath their feet they answered my questions civilly enough but they would not enter into conversation  me it   other slaves  i learned  gossip   city troops  pouring    west  south  pouring out toward  east i asked  old slave who  sweeping  dirt into little piles   gutters   street where  soldiers  going he looked  me  surprise “why  fight  yellow men  course”  said “they have crossed  border   marching toward new gondar” “who  win” i asked he shrugged his shoulders “who knows”  said “i hope     yellow men but menelek  powerful—it  take many yellow men  defeat him” crowds  gathering along  sidewalks  view  emperorl’s entry into  city i took my place among them although i hate crowds  i am glad  i did  i witnessed such  spectacle  barbaric splendor  no other panamerican  ever looked upon down  broad main thoroughfare which may once have been  historic unter den linden came  brilliant cortege at  head rode  regiment  redcoated hussars—enormous men black  night there  troops  riflemen mounted  camels the emperor rode   golden howdah upon  back   huge elephant so covered  rich hangings  embellished  scintillating gems  scarce more than  beastl’s eyes  feet  visible menelek   rather grosslooking man well past middle age but  carried himself   air  dignity befitting one descended  unbroken line   prophet—as  his claim his eyes  bright but crafty  his features denoted both sensuality  cruelness in his youth  may have been  rather fine looking black but when i saw him his appearance  revolting—to me  least following  emperor came regiment after regiment   various branches   service among them batteries  field guns mounted  elephants in  center   troops following  imperial elephant marched  great caravan  slaves the old street sweeper  my elbow told me  these   gifts brought    far outlying districts   commanding officers   frontier posts the majority  them  women destined i  told   harems   emperor  his favorites it made my old companion clench his fists  see those poor white women marching past  their horrid fates and though i shared his sentiments i   powerless  alter their destinies  he for  week  troops kept pouring   out  new gondar—in always   south  west but always toward  east each new contingent brought  gifts   emperor from  south they brought rugs  ornaments  jewels   west slaves   commanding officers   western frontier posts had naught else  bring from  number  women they brought i judged  they knew  weakness  their imperial master and then soldiers commenced coming    east but not   gay assurance  those who came   south  west—no these others came  covered wagons bloodsoaked  suffering they came  first  little parties  eight or ten  then they came  fifties  hundreds  one day  thousand maimed  dying men  carted into new gondar it  then  menelek xiv became uneasy for fifty years his armies had conquered wherever they had marched at first  had led them  person lately his presence within  hundred miles   battle line had been sufficient  large engagements—for minor ones only  knowledge  they  fighting   glory  their sovereign  necessary  win victories one morning new gondar  awakened   booming  cannon it   first intimation   townspeople had received   enemy  forcing  imperial troops back upon  city dust covered couriers galloped    front fresh troops hastened   city  about noon menelek rode out surrounded  his staff for three days thereafter we could hear  cannonading   spitting   small arms   battle line  scarce two leagues  new gondar the city  filled  wounded just outside soldiers  engaged  throwing up earthworks it  evident   least enlightened  menelek expected further reverses and then  imperial troops fell back upon these new defenses or rather they  forced back   enemy shells commenced  fall within  city menelek returned  took up his headquarters   stone building   called  palace that night came  lull   hostilities—a truce had been arranged colonel belik summoned me about seven o’clock  dress him   function   palace in  midst  death  defeat  emperor  about  give  great banquet  his officers i   accompany my master  wait upon him—i jefferson turck lieutenant   panamerican navy in  privacy   colonel’s quarters i had become accustomed  my menial duties lightened  they    natural kindliness  my master but  thought  appearing  public   common slave revolted every fine instinct within me yet there  nothing   but  obey i cannot even now bring myself   narration   humiliation which i experienced  night  i stood behind my black master  silent servility now pouring his wine now cutting up his meats  him now fanning him   large plumed fan  feathers as fond  i had grown  him i could have thrust  knife into him so keenly did i feel  affront  had been put upon me but  last  long banquet  concluded the tables  removed the emperor ascended  dais  one end   room  seated himself upon  throne   entertainment commenced it  only what ancient history might have led me  expect—musicians dancing girls jugglers   like near midnight  master  ceremonies announced   slave women who had been presented   emperor since his arrival  new gondar would  exhibited   royal host would select such   wished after which  would present  balance  them  his guests ah what royal generosity a small door  one side   room opened   poor creatures filed    ranged   long line before  throne their backs  toward me i saw only  occasional profile  now  then  bolder spirit among them turned  survey  apartment   gorgeous assemblage  officers  their brilliant dress uniforms they  profiles  young girls  pretty but horror  indelibly stamped upon them all i shuddered  i contemplated their sad fate  turned my eyes away i heard  master  ceremonies command them  prostrate themselves before  emperor   sounds  they went upon their knees before him touching their foreheads   floor then came  official’s voice again  sharp  peremptory command “down slave”  cried “make obeisance  your sovereign” i looked up attracted   tone   manl’s voice  see  single straight slim figure standing erect   center   line  prostrate girls her arms folded across her breast  little chin   air her back  toward me—i could not see her face though i should like  see  countenance  this savage young lioness standing there defiant among  herd  terrified sheep “down down” shouted  master  ceremonies taking  step toward her  half drawing his sword my blood boiled to stand there inactive while  negro struck down  brave girl  my own race instinctively i took  forward step  place myself   manl’s path but   same instant menelek raised his hand   gesture  halted  officer the emperor seemed interested but  no way angered   girl’s attitude “let us inquire”  said   smooth pleasant voice “why this young woman refuses  do homage  her sovereign”   put  question himself directly  her she answered him  abyssinian but brokenly    accent  betrayed how recently she had acquired her slight knowledge   tongue “i go  my knees  no one” she said “i have no sovereign i myself am sovereign  my own country” menelek  her words leaned back  his throne  laughed uproariously following his example which seemed always  correct procedure  assembled guests vied  one another   effort  laugh more noisily than  emperor the girl but tilted her chin  bit higher   air—even her back proclaimed her utter contempt  her captors finally menelek restored quiet   simple expedient   frown whereupon each loyal guest exchanged his mirthful mien   emulative scowl “and who” asked menelek “are you   what name  your country called” “i am victory queen  grabritin” replied  girl so quickly  so unexpectedly  i gasped  astonishment chapter ix victory she  here  slave  these black conquerors once more i started toward her but better judgment held me back—i could do nothing  help her other than  stealth could i even accomplish aught  this means i did not know it seemed beyond  pale  possibility  yet i should try “and you  not bend  knee  me” continued menelek after she had spoken victory shook her head   most decided negation “you shall  my first choice then” said  emperor “i like your spirit   breaking    add  my pleasure  you  never fear but   shall  broken—this very night take her  my apartments”   motioned   officer  his side i  surprised  see victory follow  man off  apparent quiet submission i tried  follow  i might  near her against some opportunity  speak  her or assist  her escape but after i had followed them   throne room through several other apartments  down  long corridor i found my further progress barred   soldier who stood guard before  doorway through which  officer conducted victory almost immediately  officer reappeared  started back   direction   throne room i had been hiding   doorway after  guard had turned me back having taken refuge there while his back  turned and   officer approached me i withdrew into  room beyond which   darkness there i remained   long time watching  sentry before  door   room  which victory   prisoner  awaiting some favorable circumstance which would give me entry  her i have not attempted  fully describe my sensations   moment i recognized victory because i can assure you they  entirely indescribable i should never have imagined   sight  any human being could affect me  had this unexpected discovery  victory   same room  which i was while i had thought  her  weeks either  dead or  best hundreds  miles   west   irretrievably lost  me  though she were  truth dead i  filled   strange mad impulse   near her it  not enough merely  assist her or protect her—i desired  touch her—to take her  my arms i  astounded  myself another thing puzzled me—it  my incomprehensible feeling  elation since i had again seen her with  fate worse than death staring her   face    knowledge  i should probably die defending her within  hour i  still happier than i had been  weeks—and all because i had seen again   few brief minutes  figure   little heathen maiden i couldn’t account  it   angered me i had never before felt any such sensations   presence   woman  i had made love  some very beautiful ones  my time it seemed ages  i stood   shadow   doorway   illlit corridor   palace  menelek xiv a sickly gas jet cast  sad pallor upon  black face   sentry the fellow seemed rooted   spot evidently  would never leave or turn his back again i had been  hiding but  short time when i heard  sound  distant cannon the truce had ended   battle had been resumed very shortly thereafter  earth shook   explosion   shell within  city   time  time thereafter other shells burst  no great distance   palace the yellow men  bombarding new gondar again presently officers  slaves commenced  traverse  corridor  matters pertaining  their duties  then came  emperor scowling  wrathful he  followed   few personal attendants whom  dismissed   doorway  his apartments—the same doorway through which victory had been taken i chafed  follow him but  corridor  filled  people at last they betook themselves  their own apartments which lay upon either side   corridor an officer   slave entered  very room  which i hid forcing me  flatten myself  one side   darkness until they had passed then  slave made  light  i knew  i must find another hiding place stepping boldly into  corridor i saw    now empty save   single sentry before  emperorl’s door he glanced up  i emerged   room  occupants  which had not seen me i walked straight toward  soldier my mind made up   instant i tried  simulate  expression  cringing servility  i must have succeeded  i entirely threw  man off his guard so   permitted me  approach within reach  his rifle before stopping me then   too late—for him without  word or  warning i snatched  piece  his grasp and   same time struck him  terrific blow between  eyes  my clenched fist he staggered back  surprise too dumbfounded even  cry out  then i clubbed his rifle  felled him   single mighty blow a moment later i had burst into  room beyond it  empty i gazed about mad  disappointment two doors opened  this  other rooms i ran   nearer  listened yes voices  coming  beyond  one   womanl’s level  cold  filled  scorn there  no terror  it it  victoryl’s i turned  knob  pushed  door inward just  time  see menelek seize  girl  drag her toward  far end   apartment at  same instant there   deafening roar just outside  palace—a shell had struck much nearer than any   predecessors the noise   drowned my rapid rush across  room but  her struggles victory turned menelek about so   saw me she  striking him   face  her clenched fist  now   choking her at sight  me  gave voice   roar  anger “what means this slave”  cried “out  here out  here quick before i kill you” but  answer i rushed upon him striking him   butt   rifle he staggered back dropping victory   floor  then  cried aloud   guard  came  me again  again i struck him but his thick skull might have been armor plate  all  damage i did it he tried  close  me seizing  rifle but i  stronger than he and wrenching  weapon  his grasp tossed  aside  made  his throat  my bare hands i had not dared fire  weapon  fear   report would bring  larger guard stationed   farther end   corridor we struggled about  room striking one another knocking over furniture  rolling upon  floor menelek   powerful man    fighting  his life continually  kept calling   guard until i succeeded  getting  grip upon his throat but   too late his cries had been heard  suddenly  door burst open   score  armed guardsmen rushed into  apartment victory seized  rifle   floor  leaped between me  them i had  black emperor upon his back  both my hands   his throat choking  life  him the rest happened   fraction   second there   rending crash above us then  deafening explosion within  chamber smoke  powder fumes filled  room half stunned i rose   lifeless body  my antagonist just  time  see victory stagger  her feet  turn toward me slowly  smoke cleared  reveal  shattered remnants   guard a shell had fallen through  palace roof  exploded just   rear   detachment  guardsmen who  coming   rescue  their emperor why neither victory nor i  struck   miracle the room   wreck a great jagged hole  torn   ceiling   wall toward  corridor had been blown entirely out as i rose victory had risen too  started toward me but when she saw  i  uninjured she stopped  stood there   center   demolished apartment looking  me her expression  inscrutable—i could not guess whether she  glad  see me or not “victory” i cried “thank god  you  safe” and i approached her  greater gladness  my heart than i had felt since  moment  i knew  coldwater must  swept beyond thirty there  no answering gladness  her eyes instead she stamped her little foot  anger “why did  have   you who saved me” she exclaimed “i hate you” “hate me” i asked “why should you hate me victory i do not hate you i—i—” what  i about  say i  very close  her   great light broke over me why had i never realized  before the truth accounted   great many hitherto inexplicable moods  had claimed me  time  time since first i had seen victory “why should i hate you” she repeated “because snider told me—he told me  you had promised me  him but  did not get me i killed him  i should like  kill you” “snider lied” i cried and then i seized her  held her  my arms  made her listen  me though she struggled  fought like  young lioness “i love you victory you must know  i love you—that i have always loved you   i never could have made so base  promise” she ceased her struggles just  trifle but still tried  push me  her “you called me  barbarian” she said ah so   it that still rankled i crushed her  me “you could not love  barbarian” she went on but she had ceased  struggle “but i do love  barbarian victory” i cried “the dearest barbarian   world” she raised her eyes  mine  then her smooth brown arms encircled my neck  drew my lips down  hers “i love you—i have loved you always” she said  then she buried her face upon my shoulder  sobbed “i have been so unhappy” she said “but i could not die while i thought  you might live” as we stood there momentarily forgetful  all else than our new found happiness  ferocity   bombardment increased until scarce thirty seconds elapsed between  shells  rained about  palace to remain long would   invite certain death we could not escape  way  we had entered  apartment  not only   corridor now choked  debris but beyond  corridor there  doubtless many members   emperorl’s household who would stop us upon  opposite side   room  another door  toward this i led  way it opened into  third apartment  windows overlooking  inner court from one  these windows i surveyed  courtyard apparently   empty   rooms upon  opposite side  unlighted assisting victory   open i followed  together we crossed  court discovering upon  opposite side  number  wide wooden doors set   wall   palace  small windows between as we stood close behind one   doors listening  horse within neighed “the stables” i whispered and  moment later had pushed back  door  entered from  city about us we could hear  din  great commotion  quite close  sounds  battle—the crack  thousands  rifles  yells   soldiers  hoarse commands  officers   blare  bugles the bombardment had ceased  suddenly   had commenced i judged   enemy  storming  city   sounds we heard   sounds  handtohand combat within  stables i groped about until i had found saddles  bridles  two horses but afterward   darkness i could find but  single mount the doors   opposite side leading   street  open  we could see great multitudes  men women  children fleeing toward  west soldiers afoot  mounted  joining  mad exodus now  then  camel or  elephant would pass bearing some officer or dignitary  safety it  evident   city would fall  any moment—a fact which  amply proclaimed   terrorstricken haste   fearmad mob horse camel  elephant trod helpless women  children beneath their feet a common soldier dragged  general  his mount and leaping   animal’s back fled down  packed street toward  west a woman seized  gun  brained  court dignitary whose horse had trampled her child  death shrieks curses commands supplications filled  air it   frightful scene—one    burned upon my memory forever i had saddled  bridled  single horse which had evidently been overlooked   royal household   flight and standing  little back   shadow   stable’s interior victory  i watched  surging throng without to have entered  would have been  have courted greater danger than we  already in we decided  wait until  stress  blacks thinned   more than  hour we stood there while  sounds  battle raged upon  eastern side   city   population flew toward  west more  more numerous became  uniformed soldiers among  fleeing throng until toward  last  street  packed  them it  no orderly retreat but  rout complete  terrible the fighting  steadily approaching us now until  crack  rifles sounded   very street upon which we  looking and then came  handful  brave men—a little rear guard backing slowly toward  west working their smoking rifles  feverish haste  they fired volley after volley   foe we could not see but these  pressed back  back until  first line   enemy came opposite our shelter they  men  medium height  olive complexions  almond eyes in them i recognized  descendants   ancient chinese race they  well uniformed  superbly armed  they fought bravely  under perfect discipline so rapt  i   exciting events transpiring   street  i did not hear  approach   body  men  behind it   party   conquerors who had entered  palace   searching it they came upon us so unexpectedly  we  prisoners before we realized what had happened that night we  held under  strong guard just outside  eastern wall   city   next morning  started upon  long march toward  east our captors  not unkind  us  treated  women prisoners  respect we marched  many days—so many  i lost count  them—and  last we came  another city—a chinese city this time—which stands upon  site  ancient moscow it  only  small frontier city but   well built  well kept here  large military force  maintained  here also   terminus   railroad  crosses modern china   pacific there  every evidence   high civilization  all  we saw within  city which  connection   humane treatment  had been accorded all prisoners upon  long  tiresome march encouraged me  hope  i might appeal  some high officer here   treatment which my rank  birth merited we could converse  our captors only through  medium  interpreters who spoke both chinese  abyssinian but there  many  these  shortly after we reached  city i persuaded one  them  carry  verbal message   officer who had commanded  troops during  return  new gondar asking  i might  given  hearing  some high official the reply  my request   summons  appear before  officer  whom i had addressed my appeal a sergeant came  me along   interpreter  i managed  obtain his permission  let victory accompany me—i had never left her alone   prisoners since we had been captured to my delight i found   officer into whose presence we  conducted spoke abyssinian fluently he  astounded when i told him  i   panamerican unlike all others whom i had spoken  since my arrival  europe   well acquainted  ancient history—was familiar  twentieth century conditions  panamerica  after putting  half dozen questions  me  satisfied  i spoke  truth when i told him  victory  queen  england  showed little surprise telling me   their recent explorations  ancient russia they had found many descendants   old nobility  royalty he immediately set aside  comfortable house  us furnished us  servants   money   other ways showed us every attention  kindness he told me   would telegraph his emperor  once   result   we  presently commanded  repair  peking  present ourselves before  ruler we made  journey   comfortable railway carriage through  country which  we traveled farther toward  east showed increasing evidence  prosperity  wealth at  imperial court we  received  great kindness  emperor being most inquisitive about  state  modern panamerica

europe his ambition   wrest    hands   blacks  then  attempt  work  elevating  fallen peoples   high estate  which  great war precipitated them i asked him who  victorious   war   shook his head sadly   replied “panamerica perhaps  china   blacks  abyssinia”  said “those who did not fight   only ones  reap any   rewards   supposed  belong  victory the combatants reaped naught but annihilation you have seen—better than any man you must realize  there  no victory  any nation embroiled   frightful war” “when did  end” i asked him again  shook his head “it  not ended yet there  never been  formal peace declared  europe after  while there  none left  make peace   rude tribes which sprang   survivors continued  fight among themselves because they knew no better condition  society war razed  works  man—war  pestilence razed man god give  there shall never  such another war” you all know how porfirio johnson returned  panamerica  john alvarez  chains how alvarezl’s trial raised  popular
