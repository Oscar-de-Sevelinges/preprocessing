centre   room clamped   upright easel stood  fulllength portrait   young man  extraordinary personal beauty   front  it some little distance away  sitting  artist himself basil hallward whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused   time such public excitement  gave rise  so many strange conjectures as  painter looked   gracious  comely form  had so skilfully mirrored  his art  smile  pleasure passed across his face  seemed about  linger there but  suddenly started up  closing his eyes placed his fingers upon  lids  though  sought  imprison within his brain some curious dream  which  feared  might awake “it  your best work basil  best thing you have ever done” said lord henry languidly “you must certainly send  next year   grosvenor the academy  too large  too vulgar whenever i have gone there there have been either so many people  i have not been able  see  pictures which  dreadful or so many pictures  i have not been able  see  people which  worse the grosvenor  really  only place” “i don’t think i shall send  anywhere”  answered tossing his head back   odd way  used  make his friends laugh  him  oxford “no i won’t send  anywhere” lord henry elevated his eyebrows  looked  him  amazement through  thin blue wreaths  smoke  curled up  such fanciful whorls  his heavy opiumtainted cigarette “not send  anywhere my dear fellow why have you any reason what odd chaps you painters are you do anything   world  gain  reputation as soon  you have one you seem  want  throw  away it  silly  you  there  only one thing   world worse than being talked about    not being talked about a portrait like this would set you far above all  young men  england  make  old men quite jealous if old men  ever capable  any emotion” “i know you  laugh  me”  replied “but i really can’t exhibit it i have put too much  myself into it” lord henry stretched himself out   divan  laughed “yes i knew you would but   quite true all  same” “too much  yourself  it upon my word basil i didn’t know you  so vain  i really can’t see any resemblance between you  your rugged strong face  your coalblack hair  this young adonis who looks  if   made out  ivory  roseleaves why my dear basil    narcissus  you—well  course you have  intellectual expression  all that but beauty real beauty ends where  intellectual expression begins intellect   itself  mode  exaggeration  destroys  harmony  any face the moment one sits down  think one becomes all nose or all forehead or something horrid look   successful men  any   learned professions how perfectly hideous they are except  course   church but then   church they don’t think a bishop keeps  saying   age  eighty what   told  say when    boy  eighteen    natural consequence  always looks absolutely delightful your mysterious young friend whose name you have never told me but whose picture really fascinates me never thinks i feel quite sure  that he  some brainless beautiful creature who should  always here  winter when we have no flowers  look at  always here  summer when we want something  chill our intelligence don’t flatter yourself basil you  not   least like him” “you don’t understand me harry” answered  artist “of course i am not like him i know  perfectly well indeed i should  sorry  look like him you shrug your shoulders i am telling you  truth there   fatality about all physical  intellectual distinction  sort  fatality  seems  dog through history  faltering steps  kings it  better not   different  one’s fellows the ugly   stupid have  best    this world they can sit  their ease  gape   play if they know nothing  victory they   least spared  knowledge  defeat they live  we all should live—undisturbed indifferent  without disquiet they neither bring ruin upon others nor ever receive   alien hands your rank  wealth harry my brains such  they are—my art whatever  may  worth dorian gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer  what  gods have given us suffer terribly” “dorian gray is  his name” asked lord henry walking across  studio towards basil hallward “yes   his name i didn’t intend  tell   you” “but why not” “oh i can’t explain when i like people immensely i never tell their names  any one it  like surrendering  part  them i have grown  love secrecy it seems    one thing  can make modern life mysterious or marvellous  us the commonest thing  delightful if one only hides it when i leave town now i never tell my people where i am going if i did i would lose all my pleasure it   silly habit i dare say but somehow  seems  bring  great deal  romance into one’s life i suppose you think me awfully foolish about it” “not  all” answered lord henry “not  all my dear basil you seem  forget  i am married   one charm  marriage    makes  life  deception absolutely necessary  both parties i never know where my wife is  my wife never knows what i am doing when we meet—we do meet occasionally when we dine out together or go down   duke’s—we tell each other  most absurd stories   most serious faces my wife  very good  it—much better  fact than i am she never gets confused over her dates  i always do but when she does find me out she makes no row  all i sometimes wish she would but she merely laughs  me” “i hate  way you talk about your married life harry” said basil hallward strolling towards  door  led into  garden “i believe  you  really  very good husband but  you  thoroughly ashamed  your own virtues you   extraordinary fellow you never say  moral thing  you never do  wrong thing your cynicism  simply  pose” “being natural  simply  pose   most irritating pose i know” cried lord henry laughing   two young men went out into  garden together  ensconced themselves   long bamboo seat  stood   shade   tall laurel bush the sunlight slipped over  polished leaves in  grass white daisies  tremulous after  pause lord henry pulled out his watch “i am afraid i must  going basil”  murmured “and before i go i insist  your answering  question i put  you some time ago” “what  that” said  painter keeping his eyes fixed   ground “you know quite well” “i do not harry” “well i  tell you what  is i want you  explain  me why you won’t exhibit dorian gray’s picture i want  real reason” “i told you  real reason” “no you did not you said   because there  too much  yourself  it now   childish” “harry” said basil hallward looking him straight   face “every portrait   painted  feeling   portrait   artist not   sitter the sitter  merely  accident  occasion it  not  who  revealed   painter   rather  painter who   coloured canvas reveals himself the reason i  not exhibit this picture   i am afraid  i have shown    secret  my own soul” lord henry laughed “and what  that”  asked “i  tell you” said hallward but  expression  perplexity came over his face “i am all expectation basil” continued his companion glancing  him “oh there  really very little  tell harry” answered  painter “and i am afraid you  hardly understand it perhaps you  hardly believe it” lord henry smiled  leaning down plucked  pinkpetalled daisy   grass  examined it “i am quite sure i shall understand it”  replied gazing intently   little golden whitefeathered disk “and   believing things i can believe anything provided    quite incredible” the wind shook some blossoms   trees   heavy lilacblooms  their clustering stars moved   fro   languid air a grasshopper began  chirrup   wall  like  blue thread  long thin dragonfly floated past   brown gauze wings lord henry felt  if  could hear basil hallward’s heart beating  wondered what  coming “the story  simply this” said  painter after some time “two months ago i went   crush  lady brandon’s you know we poor artists have  show ourselves  society  time  time just  remind  public  we  not savages with  evening coat   white tie  you told me once anybody even  stockbroker can gain  reputation  being civilized well after i had been   room about ten minutes talking  huge overdressed dowagers  tedious academicians i suddenly became conscious  some one  looking  me i turned halfway round  saw dorian gray   first time when our eyes met i felt  i  growing pale a curious sensation  terror came over me i knew  i had come face  face  some one whose mere personality  so fascinating that if i allowed   do so  would absorb my whole nature my whole soul my very art itself i did not want any external influence  my life you know yourself harry how independent i am  nature i have always been my own master had  least always been so till i met dorian gray then—but i don’t know how  explain   you something seemed  tell me  i    verge   terrible crisis  my life i had  strange feeling  fate had  store  me exquisite joys  exquisite sorrows i grew afraid  turned  quit  room it  not conscience  made me do so    sort  cowardice i take no credit  myself  trying  escape” “conscience  cowardice  really  same things basil conscience   tradename   firm that  all” “i don’t believe that harry  i don’t believe you do either however whatever  my motive—and  may have been pride  i used   very proud—i certainly struggled   door there  course i stumbled against lady brandon ‘you  not going  run away so soon mr hallward’ she screamed out you know her curiously shrill voice” “yes she   peacock  everything but beauty” said lord henry pulling  daisy  bits  his long nervous fingers “i could not get rid  her she brought me up  royalties  people  stars  garters  elderly ladies  gigantic tiaras  parrot noses she spoke  me  her dearest friend i had only met her once before but she took  into her head  lionize me i believe some picture  mine had made  great success   time  least had been chattered about   penny newspapers which   nineteenthcentury standard  immortality suddenly i found myself face  face   young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me we  quite close almost touching our eyes met again it  reckless  me but i asked lady brandon  introduce me  him perhaps   not so reckless after all it  simply inevitable we would have spoken  each other without any introduction i am sure  that dorian told me so afterwards he too felt  we  destined  know each other” “and how did lady brandon describe this wonderful young man” asked his companion “i know she goes   giving  rapid précis  all her guests i remember her bringing me up   truculent  redfaced old gentleman covered all over  orders  ribbons  hissing into my ear   tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible  everybody   room  most astounding details i simply fled i like  find out people  myself but lady brandon treats her guests exactly   auctioneer treats his goods she either explains them entirely away or tells one everything about them except what one wants  know” “poor lady brandon you  hard  her harry” said hallward listlessly “my dear fellow she tried  found  salon  only succeeded  opening  restaurant how could i admire her but tell me what did she say about mr dorian gray” “oh something like ‘charming boy—poor dear mother  i absolutely inseparable quite forget what  does—afraid he—doesn’t do anything—oh yes plays  piano—or    violin dear mr gray’ neither  us could help laughing  we became friends  once” “laughter  not  all  bad beginning   friendship    far  best ending  one” said  young lord plucking another daisy hallward shook his head “you don’t understand what friendship is harry”  murmured—“or what enmity is   matter you like every one    say you  indifferent  every one” “how horribly unjust  you” cried lord henry tilting his hat back  looking up   little clouds that like ravelled skeins  glossy white silk  drifting across  hollowed turquoise   summer sky “yes horribly unjust  you i make  great difference between people i choose my friends  their good looks my acquaintances  their good characters  my enemies  their good intellects a man cannot  too careful   choice  his enemies i have not got one who   fool they  all men  some intellectual power  consequently they all appreciate me is  very vain  me i think   rather vain” “i should think  was harry but according  your category i must  merely  acquaintance” “my dear old basil you  much more than  acquaintance” “and much less than  friend a sort  brother i suppose” “oh brothers i don’t care  brothers my elder brother won’t die  my younger brothers seem never  do anything else” “harry” exclaimed hallward frowning “my dear fellow i am not quite serious but i can’t help detesting my relations i suppose  comes   fact  none  us can stand other people having  same faults  ourselves i quite sympathize   rage   english democracy against what they call  vices   upper orders the masses feel  drunkenness stupidity  immorality should  their own special property   if any one  us makes  ass  himself   poaching  their preserves when poor southwark got into  divorce court their indignation  quite magnificent and yet i don’t suppose  ten per cent   proletariat live correctly” “i don’t agree   single word  you have said and what  more harry i feel sure you don’t either” lord henry stroked his pointed brown beard  tapped  toe  his patentleather boot   tasselled ebony cane “how english you  basil that   second time you have made  observation if one puts forward  idea   true englishman—always  rash thing  do—he never dreams  considering whether  idea  right or wrong the only thing  considers  any importance  whether one believes  oneself now  value   idea  nothing whatsoever  do   sincerity   man who expresses it indeed  probabilities    more insincere  man is  more purely intellectual   idea be    case   not  coloured  either his wants his desires or his prejudices however i don’t propose  discuss politics sociology or metaphysics  you i like persons better than principles  i like persons  no principles better than anything else   world tell me more about mr dorian gray how often do you see him” “every day i couldn’t  happy if i didn’t see him every day he  absolutely necessary  me” “how extraordinary i thought you would never care  anything but your art” “he  all my art  me now” said  painter gravely “i sometimes think harry  there  only two eras  any importance   world’s history the first   appearance   new medium  art   second   appearance   new personality  art also what  invention  oilpainting    venetians  face  antinous   late greek sculpture   face  dorian gray  some day   me it  not merely  i paint  him draw  him sketch  him of course i have done all that but   much more  me than  model or  sitter i won’t tell you  i am dissatisfied  what i have done  him or  his beauty  such  art cannot express it there  nothing  art cannot express  i know   work i have done since i met dorian gray  good work   best work  my life but  some curious way—i wonder  you understand me—his personality  suggested  me  entirely new manner  art  entirely new mode  style i see things differently i think  them differently i can now recreate life   way   hidden  me before ‘a dream  form  days  thought’—who   who says that i forget but   what dorian gray  been  me the merely visible presence  this lad—for  seems  me little more than  lad though   really over twenty—his merely visible presence—ah i wonder can you realize all   means unconsciously  defines  me  lines   fresh school  school    have   all  passion   romantic spirit all  perfection   spirit   greek the harmony  soul  body—how much  is we  our madness have separated  two  have invented  realism   vulgar  ideality   void harry if you only knew what dorian gray   me you remember  landscape  mine  which agnew offered me such  huge price but which i would not part with it  one   best things i have ever done and why   so because while i  painting it dorian gray sat beside me some subtle influence passed  him  me    first time  my life i saw   plain woodland  wonder i had always looked   always missed” “basil this  extraordinary i must see dorian gray” hallward got up   seat  walked up  down  garden after some time  came back “harry”  said “dorian gray   me simply  motive  art you might see nothing  him i see everything  him he  never more present  my work than when no image  him  there he   suggestion  i have said   new manner i find him   curves  certain lines   loveliness  subtleties  certain colours that  all” “then why won’t you exhibit his portrait” asked lord henry “because without intending it i have put into  some expression  all this curious artistic idolatry  which  course i have never cared  speak  him he knows nothing about it he shall never know anything about it but  world might guess it  i  not bare my soul  their shallow prying eyes my heart shall never  put under their microscope there  too much  myself   thing harry—too much  myself” “poets  not so scrupulous  you are they know how useful passion   publication nowadays  broken heart  run  many editions” “i hate them  it” cried hallward “an artist should create beautiful things but should put nothing  his own life into them we live   age when men treat art  if   meant    form  autobiography we have lost  abstract sense  beauty some day i  show  world what  is    reason  world shall never see my portrait  dorian gray” “i think you  wrong basil but i won’t argue  you it  only  intellectually lost who ever argue tell me  dorian gray very fond  you” the painter considered   few moments “he likes me”  answered after  pause “i know  likes me of course i flatter him dreadfully i find  strange pleasure  saying things  him  i know i shall  sorry  having said as  rule   charming  me  we sit   studio  talk   thousand things now  then however   horribly thoughtless  seems  take  real delight  giving me pain then i feel harry  i have given away my whole soul  some one who treats   if    flower  put  his coat  bit  decoration  charm his vanity  ornament   summer’s day” “days  summer basil  apt  linger” murmured lord henry “perhaps you  tire sooner than  will it   sad thing  think of but there  no doubt  genius lasts longer than beauty that accounts   fact  we all take such pains  overeducate ourselves in  wild struggle  existence we want  have something  endures  so we fill our minds  rubbish  facts   silly hope  keeping our place the thoroughly wellinformed man—that   modern ideal and  mind   thoroughly wellinformed man   dreadful thing it  like  bricàbrac shop all monsters  dust  everything priced above  proper value i think you  tire first all  same some day you  look  your friend    seem  you    little out  drawing or you won’t like his tone  colour or something you  bitterly reproach him  your own heart  seriously think    behaved very badly  you the next time  calls you   perfectly cold  indifferent it    great pity    alter you what you have told me  quite  romance  romance  art one might call it   worst  having  romance  any kind    leaves one so unromantic” “harry don’t talk like that as long  i live  personality  dorian gray  dominate me you can’t feel what i feel you change too often” “ah my dear basil   exactly why i can feel it those who  faithful know only  trivial side  love    faithless who know love’s tragedies” and lord henry struck  light   dainty silver case  began  smoke  cigarette   selfconscious  satisfied air  if  had summed up  world   phrase there   rustle  chirruping sparrows   green lacquer leaves   ivy   blue cloudshadows chased themselves across  grass like swallows how pleasant     garden and how delightful other people’s emotions were—much more delightful than their ideas  seemed  him one’s own soul   passions  one’s friends—those   fascinating things  life he pictured  himself  silent amusement  tedious luncheon   had missed  staying so long  basil hallward had  gone  his aunt’s  would have been sure  have met lord goodbody there   whole conversation would have been about  feeding   poor   necessity  model lodginghouses each class would have preached  importance  those virtues  whose exercise there  no necessity  their own lives the rich would have spoken   value  thrift   idle grown eloquent over  dignity  labour it  charming  have escaped all that as  thought  his aunt  idea seemed  strike him he turned  hallward  said “my dear fellow i have just remembered” “remembered what harry” “where i heard  name  dorian gray” “where  it” asked hallward   slight frown “don’t look so angry basil it   my aunt lady agatha’s she told me she had discovered  wonderful young man who  going  help her   east end   his name  dorian gray i am bound  state  she never told me   goodlooking women have no appreciation  good looks  least good women have not she said    very earnest  had  beautiful nature i  once pictured  myself  creature  spectacles  lank hair horribly freckled  tramping about  huge feet i wish i had known   your friend” “i am very glad you didn’t harry” “why” “i don’t want you  meet him” “you don’t want me  meet him” “no” “mr dorian gray    studio sir” said  butler coming into  garden “you must introduce me now” cried lord henry laughing the painter turned  his servant who stood blinking   sunlight “ask mr gray  wait parker i shall     few moments” the man bowed  went up  walk then  looked  lord henry “dorian gray  my dearest friend”  said “he   simple   beautiful nature your aunt  quite right  what she said  him don’t spoil him don’t try  influence him your influence would  bad the world  wide   many marvellous people  it don’t take away  me  one person who gives  my art whatever charm  possesses my life   artist depends  him mind harry i trust you” he spoke very slowly   words seemed wrung out  him almost against his will “what nonsense you talk” said lord henry smiling  taking hallward   arm  almost led him into  house chapter ii as they entered they saw dorian gray he  seated   piano  his back  them turning over  pages   volume  schumann’s “forest scenes” “you must lend me these basil”  cried “i want  learn them they  perfectly charming” “that entirely depends  how you sit today dorian” “oh i am tired  sitting  i don’t want  lifesized portrait  myself” answered  lad swinging round   musicstool   wilful petulant manner when  caught sight  lord henry  faint blush coloured his cheeks   moment   started up “i beg your pardon basil but i didn’t know you had any one  you” “this  lord henry wotton dorian  old oxford friend  mine i have just been telling him what  capital sitter you were  now you have spoiled everything” “you have not spoiled my pleasure  meeting you mr gray” said lord henry stepping forward  extending his hand “my aunt  often spoken  me about you you  one  her favourites and i am afraid one  her victims also” “i am  lady agatha’s black books  present” answered dorian   funny look  penitence “i promised  go   club  whitechapel  her last tuesday  i really forgot all about it we   have played  duet together—three duets i believe i don’t know what she  say  me i am far too frightened  call” “oh i  make your peace  my aunt she  quite devoted  you and i don’t think  really matters about your not being there the audience probably thought    duet when aunt agatha sits down   piano she makes quite enough noise  two people” “that  very horrid  her  not very nice  me” answered dorian laughing lord henry looked  him yes   certainly wonderfully handsome  his finely curved scarlet lips his frank blue eyes his crisp gold hair there  something  his face  made one trust him  once all  candour  youth  there  well  all youth’s passionate purity one felt   had kept himself unspotted   world no wonder basil hallward worshipped him “you  too charming  go   philanthropy mr gray—far too charming” and lord henry flung himself down   divan  opened his cigarettecase the painter had been busy mixing his colours  getting his brushes ready he  looking worried  when  heard lord henry’s last remark  glanced  him hesitated   moment  then said “harry i want  finish this picture today would you think  awfully rude  me if i asked you  go away” lord henry smiled  looked  dorian gray “am i  go mr gray”  asked “oh please don’t lord henry i see  basil   one  his sulky moods  i can’t bear him when  sulks besides i want you  tell me why i should not go   philanthropy” “i don’t know  i shall tell you that mr gray it  so tedious  subject  one would have  talk seriously about it but i certainly shall not run away now  you have asked me  stop you don’t really mind basil do you you have often told me  you liked your sitters  have some one  chat to” hallward bit his lip “if dorian wishes it  course you must stay dorian’s whims  laws  everybody except himself” lord henry took up his hat  gloves “you  very pressing basil but i am afraid i must go i have promised  meet  man   orleans goodbye mr gray come  see me some afternoon  curzon street i am nearly always  home  five o’clock write  me when you  coming i should  sorry  miss you” “basil” cried dorian gray “if lord henry wotton goes i shall go too you never open your lips while you  painting    horribly dull standing   platform  trying  look pleasant ask him  stay i insist upon it” “stay harry  oblige dorian   oblige me” said hallward gazing intently  his picture “it  quite true i never talk when i am working  never listen either   must  dreadfully tedious  my unfortunate sitters i beg you  stay” “but what about my man   orleans” the painter laughed “i don’t think there   any difficulty about that sit down again harry and now dorian get up   platform  don’t move about too much or pay any attention  what lord henry says he   very bad influence over all his friends   single exception  myself” dorian gray stepped up   dais   air   young greek martyr  made  little moue  discontent  lord henry  whom  had rather taken  fancy he  so unlike basil they made  delightful contrast and  had such  beautiful voice after  few moments  said  him “have you really  very bad influence lord henry as bad  basil says” “there  no such thing   good influence mr gray all influence  immoral—immoral   scientific point  view” “why” “because  influence  person   give him one’s own soul he does not think his natural thoughts or burn  his natural passions his virtues  not real  him his sins if there  such things  sins  borrowed he becomes  echo  some one else’s music  actor   part   not been written  him the aim  life  selfdevelopment to realize one’s nature perfectly—that  what each  us  here for people  afraid  themselves nowadays they have forgotten  highest  all duties  duty  one owes  one’s self of course they  charitable they feed  hungry  clothe  beggar but their own souls starve   naked courage  gone out  our race perhaps we never really had it the terror  society which   basis  morals  terror  god which   secret  religion—these   two things  govern us and yet—” “just turn your head  little more   right dorian like  good boy” said  painter deep  his work  conscious only   look had come into  lad’s face   had never seen there before “and yet” continued lord henry  his low musical voice    graceful wave   hand   always so characteristic  him    had even  his eton days “i believe  if one man   live out his life fully  completely   give form  every feeling expression  every thought reality  every dream—i believe   world would gain such  fresh impulse  joy  we would forget all  maladies  mediævalism  return   hellenic ideal—to something finer richer than  hellenic ideal  may be but  bravest man amongst us  afraid  himself the mutilation   savage   tragic survival   selfdenial  mars our lives we  punished  our refusals every impulse  we strive  strangle broods   mind  poisons us the body sins once   done   sin  action   mode  purification nothing remains then but  recollection   pleasure or  luxury   regret the only way  get rid   temptation   yield  it resist it  your soul grows sick  longing   things   forbidden  itself  desire  what  monstrous laws have made monstrous  unlawful it  been said   great events   world take place   brain it    brain   brain only   great sins   world take place also you mr gray you yourself  your rosered youth  your rosewhite boyhood you have had passions  have made you afraid thoughts  have filled you  terror daydreams  sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek  shame—” “stop” faltered dorian gray “stop you bewilder me i don’t know what  say there  some answer  you but i cannot find it don’t speak let me think or rather let me try not  think” for nearly ten minutes  stood there motionless  parted lips  eyes strangely bright he  dimly conscious  entirely fresh influences   work within him yet they seemed  him  have come really  himself the few words  basil’s friend had said  him—words spoken  chance no doubt   wilful paradox  them—had touched some secret chord  had never been touched before but   felt  now vibrating  throbbing  curious pulses music had stirred him like that music had troubled him many times but music  not articulate it  not  new world but rather another chaos   created  us words mere words how terrible they were how clear  vivid  cruel one could not escape  them and yet what  subtle magic there   them they seemed   able  give  plastic form  formless things   have  music  their own  sweet    viol or  lute mere words was there anything so real  words yes there had been things  his boyhood   had not understood he understood them now life suddenly became fierycoloured  him it seemed  him   had been walking  fire why had  not known it with his subtle smile lord henry watched him he knew  precise psychological moment when  say nothing he felt intensely interested he  amazed   sudden impression  his words had produced and remembering  book   had read when   sixteen  book which had revealed  him much   had not known before  wondered whether dorian gray  passing through  similar experience he had merely shot  arrow into  air had  hit  mark how fascinating  lad was hallward painted away   marvellous bold touch  his  had  true refinement  perfect delicacy   art  any rate comes only  strength he  unconscious   silence “basil i am tired  standing” cried dorian gray suddenly “i must go out  sit   garden the air  stifling here” “my dear fellow i am so sorry when i am painting i can’t think  anything else but you never sat better you  perfectly still and i have caught  effect i wanted—the halfparted lips   bright look   eyes i don’t know what harry  been saying  you but   certainly made you have  most wonderful expression i suppose   been paying you compliments you mustn’t believe  word   says” “he  certainly not been paying me compliments perhaps    reason  i don’t believe anything   told me” “you know you believe  all” said lord henry looking  him  his dreamy languorous eyes “i  go out   garden  you it  horribly hot   studio basil let us have something iced  drink something  strawberries  it” “certainly harry just touch  bell  when parker comes i  tell him what you want i have got  work up this background so i  join you later on don’t keep dorian too long i have never been  better form  painting than i am today this  going   my masterpiece it  my masterpiece   stands” lord henry went out   garden  found dorian gray burying his face   great cool lilacblossoms feverishly drinking  their perfume  if  had been wine he came close  him  put his hand upon his shoulder “you  quite right  do that”  murmured “nothing can cure  soul but  senses just  nothing can cure  senses but  soul” the lad started  drew back he  bareheaded   leaves had tossed his rebellious curls  tangled all their gilded threads there   look  fear  his eyes such  people have when they  suddenly awakened his finely chiselled nostrils quivered  some hidden nerve shook  scarlet  his lips  left them trembling “yes” continued lord henry “that  one   great secrets  life—to cure  soul  means   senses   senses  means   soul you   wonderful creation you know more than you think you know just  you know less than you want  know” dorian gray frowned  turned his head away he could not help liking  tall graceful young man who  standing  him his romantic olivecoloured face  worn expression interested him there  something  his low languid voice   absolutely fascinating his cool white flowerlike hands even had  curious charm they moved   spoke like music  seemed  have  language  their own but  felt afraid  him  ashamed  being afraid why had  been left   stranger  reveal him  himself he had known basil hallward  months but  friendship between them had never altered him suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed  have disclosed  him life’s mystery and yet what  there   afraid of he  not  schoolboy or  girl it  absurd   frightened “let us go  sit   shade” said lord henry “parker  brought out  drinks  if you stay any longer  this glare you   quite spoiled  basil  never paint you again you really must not allow yourself  become sunburnt it would  unbecoming” “what can  matter” cried dorian gray laughing   sat down   seat   end   garden “it should matter everything  you mr gray” “why” “because you have  most marvellous youth  youth   one thing worth having” “i don’t feel that lord henry” “no you don’t feel  now some day when you  old  wrinkled  ugly when thought  seared your forehead   lines  passion branded your lips   hideous fires you  feel it you  feel  terribly now wherever you go you charm  world will  always  so  you have  wonderfully beautiful face mr gray don’t frown you have and beauty   form  genius—is higher indeed than genius   needs no explanation it    great facts   world like sunlight or springtime or  reflection  dark waters   silver shell we call  moon it cannot  questioned it   divine right  sovereignty it makes princes  those who have it you smile ah when you have lost  you won’t smile people say sometimes  beauty  only superficial that may  so but  least   not so superficial  thought is to me beauty   wonder  wonders it  only shallow people who do not judge  appearances the true mystery   world   visible not  invisible yes mr gray  gods have been good  you but what  gods give they quickly take away you have only  few years  which  live really perfectly  fully when your youth goes your beauty  go  it  then you  suddenly discover  there  no triumphs left  you or have  content yourself  those mean triumphs   memory  your past  make more bitter than defeats every month   wanes brings you nearer  something dreadful time  jealous  you  wars against your lilies

failure or giving away your life   ignorant  common   vulgar these   sickly aims  false ideals  our age live live  wonderful life    you let nothing  lost upon you be always searching  new sensations be afraid  nothing a new hedonism—that  what our century wants you might   visible symbol with your personality there  nothing you could not do the world belongs  you   season the moment i met you i saw  you  quite unconscious  what you really are  what you really might be there  so much  you  charmed me  i felt i must tell you something about yourself i thought how tragic  would  if you  wasted for there  such  little time  your youth  last—such  little time the common hillflowers wither but they blossom again the laburnum    yellow next june    now in  month there   purple stars   clematis  year after year  green night   leaves  hold  purple stars but we never get back our youth the pulse  joy  beats  us  twenty becomes sluggish our limbs fail our senses rot we degenerate into hideous puppets haunted   memory   passions  which we  too much afraid   exquisite temptations  we had not  courage  yield to youth youth there  absolutely nothing   world but youth” dorian gray listened openeyed  wondering the spray  lilac fell  his hand upon  gravel a furry bee came  buzzed round    moment then  began  scramble all over  oval stellated globe   tiny blossoms he watched    strange interest  trivial things  we try  develop when things  high import make us afraid or when we  stirred  some new emotion  which we cannot find expression or when some thought  terrifies us lays sudden siege   brain  calls  us  yield after  time  bee flew away he saw  creeping into  stained trumpet   tyrian convolvulus the flower seemed  quiver  then swayed gently   fro suddenly  painter appeared   door   studio  made staccato signs  them  come in they turned  each other  smiled “i am waiting”  cried “do come in the light  quite perfect  you can bring your drinks” they rose up  sauntered down  walk together two greenandwhite butterflies fluttered past them    peartree   corner   garden  thrush began  sing “you  glad you have met me mr gray” said lord henry looking  him “yes i am glad now i wonder shall i always  glad” “always that   dreadful word it makes me shudder when i hear it women  so fond  using it they spoil every romance  trying  make  last  ever it   meaningless word too the only difference between  caprice   lifelong passion    caprice lasts  little longer” as they entered  studio dorian gray put his hand upon lord henry’s arm “in  case let our friendship   caprice”  murmured flushing  his own boldness then stepped up   platform  resumed his pose lord henry flung himself into  large wicker armchair  watched him the sweep  dash   brush   canvas made  only sound  broke  stillness except when now  then hallward stepped back  look  his work   distance in  slanting beams  streamed through  open doorway  dust danced   golden the heavy scent   roses seemed  brood over everything after about  quarter   hour hallward stopped painting looked   long time  dorian gray  then   long time   picture biting  end  one  his huge brushes  frowning “it  quite finished”  cried  last  stooping down  wrote his name  long vermilion letters   lefthand corner   canvas lord henry came over  examined  picture it  certainly  wonderful work  art   wonderful likeness  well “my dear fellow i congratulate you most warmly”  said “it   finest portrait  modern times mr gray come over  look  yourself” the lad started  if awakened  some dream “is  really finished”  murmured stepping down   platform “quite finished” said  painter “and you have sat splendidly today i am awfully obliged  you” “that  entirely due  me” broke  lord henry “isn’t it mr gray” dorian made no answer but passed listlessly  front  his picture  turned towards it when  saw   drew back  his cheeks flushed   moment  pleasure a look  joy came into his eyes  if  had recognized himself   first time he stood there motionless   wonder dimly conscious  hallward  speaking  him but not catching  meaning  his words the sense  his own beauty came  him like  revelation he had never felt  before basil hallward’s compliments had seemed  him   merely  charming exaggeration  friendship he had listened  them laughed  them forgotten them they had not influenced his nature then had come lord henry wotton  his strange panegyric  youth his terrible warning   brevity that had stirred him   time  now   stood gazing   shadow  his own loveliness  full reality   description flashed across him yes there would   day when his face would  wrinkled  wizen his eyes dim  colourless  grace  his figure broken  deformed the scarlet would pass away  his lips   gold steal  his hair the life    make his soul would mar his body he would become dreadful hideous  uncouth as  thought  it  sharp pang  pain struck through him like  knife  made each delicate fibre  his nature quiver his eyes deepened into amethyst  across them came  mist  tears he felt  if  hand  ice had been laid upon his heart “don’t you like it” cried hallward  last stung  little   lad’s silence not understanding what  meant “of course  likes it” said lord henry “who wouldn’t like it it  one   greatest things  modern art i  give you anything you like  ask  it i must have it” “it  not my property harry” “whose property  it” “dorian’s  course” answered  painter “he   very lucky fellow” “how sad  is” murmured dorian gray  his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait “how sad  is i shall grow old  horrible  dreadful but this picture  remain always young it  never  older than this particular day  june if   only  other way if   i who    always young   picture    grow old for that—for that—i would give everything yes there  nothing   whole world i would not give i would give my soul  that” “you would hardly care  such  arrangement basil” cried lord henry laughing “it would  rather hard lines  your work” “i should object very strongly harry” said hallward dorian gray turned  looked  him “i believe you would basil you like your art better than your friends i am no more  you than  green bronze figure hardly  much i dare say” the painter stared  amazement it  so unlike dorian  speak like that what had happened he seemed quite angry his face  flushed  his cheeks burning “yes”  continued “i am less  you than your ivory hermes or your silver faun you  like them always how long  you like me till i have my first wrinkle i suppose i know now  when one loses one’s good looks whatever they may be one loses everything your picture  taught me that lord henry wotton  perfectly right youth   only thing worth having when i find  i am growing old i shall kill myself” hallward turned pale  caught his hand “dorian dorian”  cried “don’t talk like that i have never had such  friend  you  i shall never have such another you  not jealous  material things  you—you who  finer than any  them” “i am jealous  everything whose beauty does not die i am jealous   portrait you have painted  me why should  keep what i must lose every moment  passes takes something  me  gives something  it oh if   only  other way if  picture could change  i could  always what i am now why did you paint it it  mock me some day—mock me horribly” the hot tears welled into his eyes  tore his hand away and flinging himself   divan  buried his face   cushions  though   praying “this  your doing harry” said  painter bitterly lord henry shrugged his shoulders “it   real dorian gray—that  all” “it  not” “if   not what have i  do  it” “you should have gone away when i asked you”  muttered “i stayed when you asked me”  lord henry’s answer “harry i can’t quarrel  my two best friends  once but between you both you have made me hate  finest piece  work i have ever done  i  destroy it what   but canvas  colour i  not let  come across our three lives  mar them” dorian gray lifted his golden head   pillow   pallid face  tearstained eyes looked  him   walked over   deal paintingtable   set beneath  high curtained window what   doing there his fingers  straying about among  litter  tin tubes  dry brushes seeking  something yes     long paletteknife   thin blade  lithe steel he had found   last he  going  rip up  canvas with  stifled sob  lad leaped   couch and rushing over  hallward tore  knife out  his hand  flung    end   studio “don’t basil don’t”  cried “it would  murder” “i am glad you appreciate my work  last dorian” said  painter coldly when  had recovered  his surprise “i never thought you would” “appreciate it i am  love  it basil it  part  myself i feel that” “well  soon  you  dry you shall  varnished  framed  sent home then you can do what you like  yourself” and  walked across  room  rang  bell  tea “you  have tea  course dorian and so  you harry or do you object  such simple pleasures” “i adore simple pleasures” said lord henry “they   last refuge   complex but i don’t like scenes except   stage what absurd fellows you are both  you i wonder who   defined man   rational animal it   most premature definition ever given man  many things but   not rational i am glad   not after all—though i wish you chaps would not squabble over  picture you had much better let me have it basil this silly boy doesn’t really want it  i really do” “if you let any one have  but me basil i shall never forgive you” cried dorian gray “and i don’t allow people  call me  silly boy” “you know  picture  yours dorian i gave   you before  existed” “and you know you have been  little silly mr gray   you don’t really object  being reminded  you  extremely young” “i should have objected very strongly this morning lord henry” “ah this morning you have lived since then” there came  knock   door   butler entered   laden teatray  set  down upon  small japanese table there   rattle  cups  saucers   hissing   fluted georgian urn two globeshaped china dishes  brought    page dorian gray went over  poured out  tea the two men sauntered languidly   table  examined what  under  covers “let us go   theatre tonight” said lord henry “there  sure   something on somewhere i have promised  dine  white’s but   only   old friend so i can send him  wire  say  i am ill or  i am prevented  coming  consequence   subsequent engagement i think  would   rather nice excuse  would have all  surprise  candour” “it  such  bore putting  one’s dressclothes” muttered hallward “and when one  them on they  so horrid” “yes” answered lord henry dreamily “the costume   nineteenth century  detestable it  so sombre so depressing sin   only real colourelement left  modern life” “you really must not say things like  before dorian harry” “before which dorian the one who  pouring out tea  us or  one   picture” “before either” “i should like  come   theatre  you lord henry” said  lad “then you shall come  you  come too basil won’t you” “i can’t really i would sooner not i have  lot  work  do” “well then you  i  go alone mr gray” “i should like  awfully” the painter bit his lip  walked over cup  hand   picture “i shall stay   real dorian”  said sadly “is   real dorian” cried  original   portrait strolling across  him “am i really like that” “yes you  just like that” “how wonderful basil” “at least you  like   appearance but   never alter” sighed hallward “that  something” “what  fuss people make about fidelity” exclaimed lord henry “why even  love   purely  question  physiology it  nothing  do  our own will young men want   faithful   not old men want   faithless  cannot   all one can say” “don’t go   theatre tonight dorian” said hallward “stop  dine  me” “i can’t basil” “why” “because i have promised lord henry wotton  go  him” “he won’t like you  better  keeping your promises he always breaks his own i beg you not  go” dorian gray laughed  shook his head “i entreat you” the lad hesitated  looked over  lord henry who  watching them   teatable   amused smile “i must go basil”  answered “very well” said hallward   went over  laid down his cup   tray “it  rather late and  you have  dress you had better lose no time goodbye harry goodbye dorian come  see me soon come tomorrow” “certainly” “you won’t forget” “no  course not” cried dorian “and  harry” “yes basil” “remember what i asked you when we    garden this morning” “i have forgotten it” “i trust you” “i wish i could trust myself” said lord henry laughing “come mr gray my hansom  outside  i can drop you  your own place goodbye basil it  been  most interesting afternoon” as  door closed behind them  painter flung himself down   sofa   look  pain came into his face chapter iii

 turn only england could have produced him   always said   country  going   dogs his principles  out  date but there   good deal   said  his prejudices when lord henry entered  room  found his uncle sitting   rough shootingcoat smoking  cheroot  grumbling over the times “well harry” said  old gentleman “what brings you out so early i thought you dandies never got up till two   not visible till five” “pure family affection i assure you uncle george i want  get something out  you” “money i suppose” said lord fermor making  wry face “well sit down  tell me all about it young people nowadays imagine  money  everything” “yes” murmured lord henry settling his buttonhole  his coat “and when they grow older they know it but i don’t want money it  only people who pay their bills who want that uncle george  i never pay mine credit   capital   younger son  one lives charmingly upon it besides i always deal  dartmoor’s tradesmen  consequently they never bother me what i want  information not

dorian gray does not belong  blue books uncle george” said lord henry languidly “mr dorian gray who  he” asked lord fermor knitting his bushy white eyebrows “that  what i have come  learn uncle george

everybody  your time so you might have known her i am very much interested  mr gray  present i have only just met him” “kelso’s grandson” echoed  old gentleman “kelso’s grandson  of course i knew his mother intimately i believe i   her christening she   extraordinarily beautiful girl margaret devereux  made all  men frantic  running away   penniless young fellow—a mere nobody sir  subaltern   foot regiment or something   kind certainly i remember  whole thing  if  happened yesterday the poor chap  killed   duel  spa  few months after  marriage there   ugly story about it they said kelso got some rascally adventurer some belgian brute  insult his soninlaw  public—paid him sir  do it paid him—and   fellow spitted his man  if  had been  pigeon the thing  hushed up but egad kelso ate his

forgotten that what sort  boy  he if   like his mother  must   goodlooking chap” “he  very goodlooking” assented lord henry “i hope   fall into proper hands” continued  old man “he should have  pot  money waiting  him if kelso did  right thing  him his mother had money too all  selby property came  her through her grandfather her grandfather hated kelso thought him  mean dog he was too came  madrid once when i  there egad i  ashamed  him the queen used  ask me about  english noble who  always quarrelling   cabmen about their fares they made quite  story  it i didn’t dare show my face  court   month i hope  treated his grandson better than  did  jarvies” “i don’t know” answered lord henry “i fancy   boy   well off he  not  age yet he  selby i know he told me so and  his mother  very beautiful” “margaret devereux  one   loveliest creatures i ever saw harry what  earth induced her  behave  she did i never could understand she could have married anybody she chose carlington  mad after her she  romantic though all  women   family were the men   poor lot but egad  women  wonderful carlington went  his knees  her told me so himself she laughed  him  there wasn’t  girl  london   time who wasn’t after him and   way harry talking about silly marriages what  this humbug your father tells me about dartmoor wanting  marry  american ain’t english girls good enough  him” “it  rather fashionable  marry americans just now uncle george” “i’ll back english women against  world harry” said lord fermor striking  table  his fist “the betting    americans” “they don’t last i am told” muttered his uncle “a long engagement exhausts them but they  capital   steeplechase they take things flying i don’t think dartmoor   chance” “who  her people” grumbled  old gentleman “has she got any” lord henry shook his head “american girls   clever  concealing their parents  english women   concealing their past”  said rising  go “they  porkpackers i suppose” “i hope so uncle george  dartmoor’s sake i am told  porkpacking   most lucrative profession  america after politics” “is she pretty” “she behaves  if she  beautiful most american women do it   secret  their charm” “why can’t these american women stay  their own country they  always telling us     paradise  women” “it is that   reason why like eve they  so excessively anxious  get out  it” said lord henry “goodbye uncle george i shall  late  lunch if i stop any longer thanks  giving me  information i wanted i always like  know everything about my new friends  nothing about my old ones” “where  you lunching harry” “at aunt agatha’s i have asked myself  mr gray he  her latest protégé” “humph tell your aunt agatha harry not  bother me any more  her charity appeals i am sick  them why  good woman thinks  i have nothing  do but  write cheques  her silly fads” “all right uncle george i’ll tell her but  won’t have any effect philanthropic people lose all sense  humanity it  their distinguishing characteristic” the old gentleman growled approvingly  rang  bell  his servant lord henry passed up  low arcade into burlington street  turned his steps   direction  berkeley square so    story  dorian gray’s

hitting below  intellect” “i do not understand you” said sir thomas growing rather red “i do lord henry” murmured mr erskine   smile “paradoxes  all very well  their way” rejoined  baronet “was   paradox” asked mr erskine “i did not think so perhaps  was well  way  paradoxes   way  truth to test reality we must see    tight rope when  verities become acrobats we can judge them” “dear me” said lady agatha “how you men argue i am sure i never can make out what you  talking about oh harry i am quite vexed  you why do you try  persuade our nice mr dorian gray  give up  east end i assure you  would  quite invaluable they would love his playing” “i want him  play  me” cried lord henry smiling   looked down  table  caught  bright answering glance “but they  so unhappy  whitechapel” continued lady agatha “i can sympathize  everything except suffering” said lord henry shrugging his shoulders “i cannot sympathize  that it  too ugly too horrible too distressing there  something terribly morbid   modern sympathy  pain one should sympathize   colour  beauty  joy  life the less said about life’s sores  better” “still  east end   very important problem” remarked sir thomas   grave shake   head “quite so” answered  young lord “it   problem  slavery  we try  solve   amusing  slaves” the politician looked  him keenly “what change do you propose then”  asked lord henry laughed “i don’t desire  change anything  england except  weather”  answered “i am quite content  philosophic contemplation but   nineteenth century  gone bankrupt through  overexpenditure  sympathy i would suggest  we should appeal  science  put us straight the advantage   emotions   they lead us astray   advantage  science     not emotional” “but we have such grave responsibilities” ventured mrs vandeleur timidly “terribly grave” echoed lady agatha lord henry looked over  mr erskine “humanity takes itself too seriously it   world’s original sin if  caveman had known how  laugh history would have been different” “you  really very comforting” warbled  duchess “i have always felt rather guilty when i came  see your dear aunt  i take no interest  all   east end for  future i shall  able  look her   face without  blush” “a blush  very becoming duchess” remarked lord henry “only when one  young” she answered “when  old woman like myself blushes    very bad sign ah lord henry i wish you would tell me how  become young again” he thought   moment “can you remember any great error  you committed  your early days duchess”  asked looking  her across  table “a great many i fear” she cried “then commit them over again”  said gravely “to get back one’s youth one  merely  repeat one’s follies” “a delightful theory” she exclaimed “i must put  into practice” “a dangerous theory” came  sir thomas’s tight lips lady agatha shook her head but could not help being amused mr erskine listened “yes”  continued “that  one   great secrets  life nowadays most people die   sort  creeping common sense  discover when   too late   only things one never regrets  one’s mistakes” a laugh ran round  table he played   idea  grew wilful tossed  into  air  transformed it let  escape  recaptured it

lady agatha   other ladies when lord henry had sat down again mr erskine moved round  taking  chair close  him placed his hand upon his arm “you talk books away”  said “why don’t you write one” “i am too fond  reading books  care  write them mr erskine i should like  write  novel certainly  novel  would   lovely   persian carpet   unreal but there  no literary public  england  anything except

thief  time so  lad  looking rather sulky   listless fingers  turned over  pages   elaborately illustrated edition  manon lescaut   had found  one   bookcases the formal monotonous ticking   louis quatorze clock annoyed him once or twice  thought  going away at last  heard  step outside   door opened “how late you are harry”  murmured “i am afraid   not harry mr gray” answered  shrill voice he glanced quickly round  rose  his feet “i beg your pardon i thought—” “you thought   my husband it  only his wife you must let me introduce myself i know you quite well  your photographs i think my husband  got seventeen  them” “not seventeen lady henry” “well eighteen then and i saw you  him  other night   opera” she laughed nervously  she spoke  watched him  her vague forgetmenot eyes she   curious woman whose dresses always looked  if they had been designed   rage  put    tempest she  usually  love  somebody and  her passion  never returned she had kept all her illusions she tried  look picturesque but only succeeded  being untidy her name  victoria  she had  perfect mania  going  church “that   lohengrin lady henry i think” “yes    dear lohengrin i like wagner’s music better than anybody’s it  so loud  one can talk  whole time without other people hearing what one says that   great advantage don’t you think so mr gray” the same nervous staccato laugh broke  her thin lips  her fingers began  play   long tortoiseshell paperknife dorian smiled  shook his head “i am afraid i don’t think so lady henry i never talk during music—at least during good music if one hears bad music   one’s duty  drown   conversation” “ah   one  harry’s views isn’t it mr gray i always hear harry’s views  his friends it   only way i get  know  them but you must not think i don’t like good music i adore it but i am afraid  it it makes me too romantic i have simply worshipped pianists—two   time sometimes harry tells me i don’t know what   about them perhaps    they  foreigners they all are ain’t they even those   born  england become foreigners after  time don’t they it  so clever  them  such  compliment  art makes  quite cosmopolitan doesn’t it you have never been  any  my parties have you mr gray you must come i can’t afford orchids but i spare no expense  foreigners they make one’s rooms look so picturesque but here  harry harry i came   look  you  ask you something—i forget what  was—and i found mr gray here we have had such  pleasant chat about music we have quite  same ideas no i think our ideas  quite different but   been most pleasant i am so glad i’ve seen him” “i am charmed my love quite charmed” said lord henry elevating his dark crescentshaped eyebrows  looking  them both   amused smile “so sorry i am late dorian i went  look after  piece  old brocade  wardour street  had  bargain  hours  it nowadays people know  price  everything   value  nothing” “i am afraid i must  going” exclaimed lady henry breaking  awkward silence  her silly sudden laugh “i have promised  drive   duchess goodbye mr gray goodbye harry you  dining out i suppose so am i perhaps i shall see you  lady thornbury’s” “i dare say my dear” said lord henry shutting  door behind her as looking like  bird  paradise  had been out all night   rain she flitted out   room leaving  faint odour  frangipanni then  lit  cigarette  flung himself down   sofa “never marry  woman  strawcoloured hair dorian”  said after  few puffs “why harry” “because they  so sentimental” “but i like sentimental people” “never marry  all dorian men marry because they  tired women because they  curious both  disappointed” “i don’t think i am likely  marry harry i am too much  love that  one  your aphorisms i am putting  into practice  i do everything  you say” “who  you  love with” asked lord henry after  pause “with  actress” said dorian gray blushing lord henry shrugged his shoulders “that   rather commonplace début” “you would not say so if you saw her harry” “who  she” “her name  sibyl vane” “never heard  her” “no one has people  some day however she   genius” “my dear boy no woman   genius women   decorative sex they never have anything  say but they say  charmingly women represent  triumph  matter over mind just  men represent  triumph  mind over morals” “harry how can you” “my dear dorian   quite true i am analysing women  present so i ought  know the subject  not so abstruse  i thought  was i find that ultimately there  only two kinds  women  plain   coloured the plain women  very useful if you want  gain  reputation  respectability you have merely  take them down  supper the other women  very charming they commit one mistake however they paint  order  try  look young our grandmothers painted  order  try  talk brilliantly rouge  esprit used  go together that  all over now as long   woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter she  perfectly satisfied as  conversation there  only five women  london worth talking to  two  these can’t  admitted into decent society however tell me about your genius how long have you known her” “ah harry your views terrify me” “never mind that how long have you known her” “about three weeks” “and where did you come across her” “i  tell you harry but you mustn’t  unsympathetic about it after all  never would have happened if i had not met you you filled me   wild desire  know everything about life for days after i met you something seemed  throb  my veins as i lounged   park or strolled down piccadilly i used  look  every one who passed me  wonder   mad curiosity what sort  lives they led some  them fascinated me others filled me  terror there   exquisite poison   air i had  passion  sensations well one evening about seven o’clock i determined  go out  search  some adventure i felt  this grey monstrous london  ours   myriads  people  sordid sinners   splendid sins  you once phrased it must have something  store  me i fancied  thousand things the mere danger gave me  sense  delight i remembered what you had said  me   wonderful evening when we first dined together about  search  beauty being  real secret  life i don’t know what i expected but i went out  wandered eastward soon losing my way   labyrinth  grimy streets  black grassless squares about halfpast eight i passed   absurd little theatre  great flaring gasjets  gaudy playbills a hideous jew   most amazing waistcoat i ever beheld  my life  standing   entrance smoking  vile cigar he had greasy ringlets   enormous diamond blazed   centre   soiled shirt ‘have  box my lord’  said when  saw me   took off his hat   air  gorgeous servility there  something about him harry  amused me he  such  monster you  laugh  me i know but i really went   paid  whole guinea   stagebox to  present day i can’t make out why i did so  yet if i hadn’t—my dear harry if i hadn’t—i should have missed  greatest romance  my life i see you  laughing it  horrid  you” “i am not laughing dorian  least i am not laughing  you but you should not say  greatest romance  your life you should say  first romance  your life you  always  loved  you  always   love  love a grande passion   privilege  people who have nothing  do that   one use   idle classes   country don’t  afraid there  exquisite things  store  you this  merely  beginning” “do you think my nature so shallow” cried dorian gray angrily “no i think your nature so deep” “how do you mean” “my dear boy  people who love only once  their lives  really  shallow people what they call their loyalty  their fidelity i call either  lethargy  custom or their lack  imagination faithfulness    emotional life what consistency    life   intellect—simply  confession  failure faithfulness i must analyse  some day the passion  property   it there  many things  we would throw away if we  not afraid  others might pick them up but i don’t want  interrupt you go   your story” “well i found myself seated   horrid little private box   vulgar dropscene staring me   face i looked out  behind  curtain  surveyed  house it   tawdry affair all cupids  cornucopias like  thirdrate weddingcake the gallery  pit  fairly full but  two rows  dingy stalls  quite empty  there  hardly  person  what i suppose they called  dresscircle women went about  oranges  gingerbeer  there   terrible consumption  nuts going on” “it must have been just like  palmy days   british drama” “just like i should fancy  very depressing i began  wonder what  earth i should do when i caught sight   playbill what do you think  play was harry” “i should think ‘the idiot boy’ or ‘dumb but innocent’ our fathers used  like  sort  piece i believe the longer i live dorian  more keenly i feel  whatever  good enough  our fathers  not good enough  us in art   politics les grandpères ont toujours tort” “this play  good enough  us harry it  romeo  juliet i must admit  i  rather annoyed   idea  seeing shakespeare done  such  wretched hole   place still i felt interested   sort  way at any rate i determined  wait   first act

this girl   mist  tears  came across me and her voice—i never heard such  voice it  very low  first  deep mellow notes  seemed  fall singly upon one’s ear then  became  little louder  sounded like  flute or  distant hautboy in  gardenscene  had all  tremulous ecstasy  one hears just before dawn when nightingales  singing there  moments later on when  had  wild passion  violins you know how

limited  their century no glamour ever transfigures them one knows their minds  easily  one knows their bonnets one can always find them there  no mystery  any  them they ride   park   morning  chatter  teaparties   afternoon they have their stereotyped smile  their fashionable manner they  quite obvious but  actress how different  actress is harry why didn’t you tell me   only thing worth loving   actress” “because i have loved so many  them dorian” “oh yes horrid people  dyed hair  painted faces” “don’t run down dyed hair  painted faces there   extraordinary charm  them sometimes” said lord henry “i wish now i had not told you about sibyl vane” “you could not have helped telling me dorian all through your life you  tell me everything you do” “yes harry i believe   true i cannot help telling you things you have  curious influence over me if i ever did  crime i would come  confess   you you would understand me” “people like you—the wilful sunbeams  life—don’t commit crimes dorian but i am much obliged   compliment all  same and now tell me—reach me  matches like  good boy—thanks—what  your actual relations  sibyl vane” dorian gray leaped  his feet  flushed cheeks  burning eyes “harry sibyl vane  sacred” “it  only  sacred things   worth touching dorian” said lord henry   strange touch  pathos  his voice “but why should you  annoyed i suppose she  belong  you some day when one   love one always begins  deceiving one’s self  one always ends  deceiving others that  what  world calls  romance you know her  any rate i suppose” “of course i know her on  first night i    theatre  horrid old jew came round   box after  performance  over  offered  take me behind  scenes  introduce me  her i  furious  him  told him  juliet had been dead  hundreds  years   her body  lying   marble tomb  verona i think  his blank look  amazement    under  impression  i had taken too much champagne or something” “i am not surprised” “then  asked me if i wrote  any   newspapers i told him i never even read them he seemed terribly disappointed  that  confided  me  all  dramatic critics    conspiracy against him   they  every one  them   bought” “i should not wonder if   quite right there but   other hand judging  their appearance most  them cannot   all expensive” “well  seemed  think they  beyond his means” laughed dorian “by this time however  lights  being put out   theatre  i had  go he wanted me  try some cigars   strongly recommended i declined the next night  course i arrived   place again when  saw me  made me  low bow  assured me  i   munificent patron  art he   most offensive brute though  had  extraordinary passion  shakespeare he told me once   air  pride  his five bankruptcies  entirely due  ‘the bard’   insisted  calling him he seemed  think   distinction” “it   distinction my dear dorian—a great distinction most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily   prose  life to have ruined one’s self over poetry   honour but when did you first speak  miss sibyl vane” “the third night she had been playing rosalind i could not help going round i had thrown her some flowers  she had looked  me—at least i fancied  she had the old jew  persistent he seemed determined  take me behind so i consented it  curious my not wanting  know her wasn’t it” “no i don’t think so” “my dear harry why” “i  tell you some other time now i want  know about  girl” “sibyl oh she  so shy  so gentle there  something   child about her her eyes opened wide  exquisite wonder when i told her what i thought  her performance  she seemed quite unconscious  her power i think we  both rather nervous the old jew stood grinning   doorway   dusty greenroom making elaborate speeches about us both while we stood looking  each other like children he would insist  calling me ‘my lord’ so i had  assure sibyl  i  not anything   kind she said quite simply  me ‘you look more like  prince i must call you prince charming’” “upon my word dorian miss sibyl knows how  pay compliments” “you don’t understand her harry she regarded me merely   person   play she knows nothing  life she lives  her mother  faded tired woman who played lady capulet   sort  magenta dressingwrapper   first night  looks  if she had seen better days” “i know  look it depresses me” murmured lord henry examining his rings “the jew wanted  tell me her history but i said  did not interest me” “you  quite right there  always something infinitely mean about other people’s tragedies” “sibyl   only thing i care about what    me where she came from from her little head  her little feet she  absolutely  entirely divine every night  my life i go  see her act  every night she  more marvellous” “that   reason i suppose  you never dine  me now i thought you must have some curious romance  hand you have but   not quite what i expected” “my dear harry we either lunch or sup together every day  i have been   opera  you several times” said dorian opening his blue eyes  wonder “you always come dreadfully late” “well i can’t help going  see sibyl play”  cried “even if   only   single act i get hungry  her presence  when i think   wonderful soul   hidden away   little ivory body i am filled  awe” “you can dine  me tonight dorian can’t you” he shook his head “tonight she  imogen”  answered “and tomorrow night she   juliet” “when  she sibyl vane” “never” “i congratulate you” “how horrid you are she  all  great heroines   world  one she  more than  individual you laugh but i tell you she  genius i love her  i must make her love me you who know all  secrets  life tell me how  charm sibyl vane  love me i want  make romeo jealous i want  dead lovers   world  hear our laughter  grow sad i want  breath  our passion  stir their dust into consciousness  wake their ashes into pain my god harry how i worship her” he  walking up  down  room   spoke hectic spots  red burned  his cheeks he  terribly excited lord henry watched him   subtle sense  pleasure how different   now   shy frightened boy  had met  basil hallward’s studio his nature had developed like  flower had borne blossoms  scarlet flame out   secret hidingplace had crept his soul  desire had come  meet    way “and what do you propose  do” said lord henry  last “i want you  basil  come  me some night  see her act i have not  slightest fear   result you  certain  acknowledge her genius then we must get her out   jew’s hands she  bound  him  three years—at least  two years  eight months—from  present time i shall have  pay him something  course when all   settled i shall take  west end theatre  bring her out properly she  make  world  mad  she  made me” “that would  impossible my dear boy” “yes she will she  not merely art consummate artinstinct  her but she  personality also  you have often told me    personalities not principles  move  age” “well what night shall we go” “let me see today  tuesday let us fix tomorrow she plays juliet tomorrow” “all right the bristol  eight o’clock  i  get basil” “not eight harry please halfpast six we must  there before  curtain rises you must see her   first act where she meets romeo” “halfpast six what  hour it   like having  meattea or reading  english novel it must  seven no gentleman dines before seven shall you see basil between this  then or shall i write  him” “dear basil i have not laid eyes  him   week it  rather horrid  me    sent me my portrait   most wonderful frame specially designed  himself and though i am  little jealous   picture  being  whole month younger than i am i must admit  i delight  it perhaps you had better write  him i don’t want  see him alone he says things  annoy me he gives me good advice” lord henry smiled “people  very fond  giving away what they need most themselves it  what i call  depth  generosity” “oh basil   best  fellows but  seems  me   just  bit   philistine since i have known you harry i have discovered that” “basil my dear boy puts everything   charming  him into his work the consequence     nothing left  life but his prejudices his principles  his common sense the only artists i have ever known who  personally delightful  bad artists good artists exist simply  what they make  consequently  perfectly uninteresting  what they are a great poet  really great poet   most unpoetical  all creatures but inferior poets  absolutely fascinating the worse their rhymes are  more picturesque they look the mere fact  having published  book  secondrate sonnets makes  man quite irresistible he lives  poetry   cannot write the others write  poetry  they dare not realize” “i wonder   really so harry” said dorian gray putting some perfume  his handkerchief out   large goldtopped bottle  stood   table “it must be if you say it and now i am off imogen  waiting  me don’t forget

“i don’t care  myself”  exclaimed “but don’t let sibyl it   gentleman isn’t it who   love  her or says  is highly connected too i suppose” for  moment  hideous sense  humiliation came over  woman her head drooped she wiped her eyes  shaking hands “sibyl   mother” she murmured “i had none” the lad  touched he went towards her  stooping down  kissed her “i am sorry if i have pained you  asking about my father”  said “but i could not help it i must go now goodbye don’t forget  you  have only one child now  look after  believe me  if this man wrongs my sister i  find out who  is track him down

hallward  shown into  little private room   bristol where dinner had been laid  three “no harry” answered  artist giving his hat  coat   bowing waiter “what  it nothing about politics i hope they don’t interest me there  hardly  single person   house  commons worth painting though many  them would   better   little whitewashing” “dorian gray  engaged   married” said lord henry watching him   spoke hallward started  then frowned “dorian engaged   married”  cried “impossible” “it  perfectly true” “to whom” “to some little actress or other” “i can’t believe it dorian  far too sensible” “dorian  far too wise not  do foolish things now  then my dear basil” “marriage  hardly  thing  one can do now  then harry” “except  america” rejoined lord henry languidly “but i didn’t say   married i said   engaged   married there   great difference i have  distinct remembrance  being married but i have no recollection  all  being engaged i am inclined  think  i never  engaged” “but think  dorian’s birth  position  wealth it would  absurd  him  marry so much beneath him” “if you want  make him marry this girl tell him that basil he  sure  do it then whenever  man does  thoroughly stupid thing   always   noblest motives” “i hope  girl  good harry i don’t want  see dorian tied  some vile creature who might degrade his nature  ruin his intellect” “oh she  better than good—she  beautiful” murmured lord henry sipping  glass  vermouth  orangebitters “dorian says she  beautiful    not often wrong about things   kind your portrait  him  quickened his appreciation   personal appearance  other people it  had  excellent effect amongst others we   see her tonight if  boy doesn’t forget his appointment” “are you serious” “quite serious basil i should  miserable if i thought i should ever  more serious than i am   present moment” “but do you approve  it harry” asked  painter walking up  down  room  biting his lip “you can’t approve  it possibly it  some silly infatuation” “i never approve or disapprove  anything now it   absurd attitude  take towards life we  not sent into  world  air our moral prejudices i never take any notice  what common people say  i never interfere  what charming people do if  personality fascinates me whatever mode  expression  personality selects  absolutely delightful  me dorian gray falls  love   beautiful girl who acts juliet  proposes  marry her why not if  wedded messalina  would  none  less interesting you know i am not  champion  marriage the real drawback  marriage    makes one unselfish and unselfish people  colourless they lack individuality still there  certain temperaments  marriage makes more complex they retain their egotism  add   many other egos they  forced  have more than one life they become more highly organized    highly organized is i should fancy  object  man’s existence besides every experience   value  whatever one may say against marriage   certainly  experience i hope  dorian gray

if dorian gray’s life  spoiled no one would  sorrier than yourself you  much better than you pretend  be” lord henry laughed “the reason we all like  think so well  others   we  all afraid  ourselves the basis  optimism  sheer terror we think  we  generous because we credit our neighbour   possession  those virtues   likely    benefit  us we praise  banker  we may overdraw our account  find good

mar  nature you have merely  reform it as  marriage  course  would  silly but there  other  more interesting bonds between men  women i  certainly encourage them they have  charm  being fashionable but here  dorian himself he  tell you more than i can” “my dear harry my dear basil you must both congratulate me” said  lad throwing off his evening cape   satinlined wings  shaking each  his friends   hand  turn “i have never been so happy of course   sudden—all really delightful things are and yet  seems  me    one thing i have been looking  all my life” he  flushed  excitement  pleasure  looked extraordinarily handsome “i hope you  always  very happy dorian” said hallward “but i don’t quite forgive you  not having let me know  your engagement you let harry know” “and i don’t forgive you  being late  dinner” broke  lord henry putting his hand   lad’s shoulder  smiling   spoke “come let us sit down  try what  new chef here  like  then you  tell us how  all came about” “there  really not much  tell” cried dorian  they took their seats   small round table “what happened  simply this after i left you yesterday evening harry i dressed had some dinner   little italian restaurant  rupert

today” asked lord henry dorian gray shook his head “i left her   forest  arden i shall find her   orchard  verona” lord henry sipped his champagne   meditative manner “at what particular point did you mention  word marriage dorian and what did she say  answer perhaps you forgot all about it” “my dear harry i did not treat    business transaction  i did not make any formal proposal i told her  i loved her  she said she  not worthy   my wife not worthy why  whole world  nothing  me compared  her” “women  wonderfully practical” murmured lord henry “much more practical than we are in situations   kind we often forget  say anything about marriage  they always remind us” hallward laid his hand upon his arm “don’t harry you have annoyed dorian he  not like other men he would never bring misery upon any one his nature  too fine  that” lord henry looked across  table “dorian  never annoyed  me”  answered “i asked  question   best reason possible   only reason indeed  excuses one  asking any question—simple curiosity i have  theory    always  women who propose  us  not we who propose   women except  course  middleclass life but then  middle classes  not modern” dorian gray laughed  tossed his head “you  quite incorrigible harry but i don’t mind it  impossible   angry  you when you see sibyl vane you  feel   man who could wrong her would   beast  beast without  heart i cannot understand how any one can wish  shame  thing  loves i love sibyl vane i want  place her   pedestal  gold   see  world worship  woman who  mine what  marriage an irrevocable vow you mock    that ah don’t mock it

touch  sibyl vane’s hand makes me forget you  all your wrong fascinating poisonous delightful theories” “and those  ” asked lord henry helping himself  some salad “oh your theories about life your theories about love your theories about pleasure all your theories  fact harry” “pleasure   only thing worth having  theory about”  answered  his slow melodious voice “but i am afraid i cannot claim my theory  my own it belongs  nature not  me pleasure  nature’s test her sign  approval when we  happy we  always good but when we  good we  not always happy” “ah but what do you mean  good” cried basil hallward “yes” echoed dorian leaning back  his chair  looking  lord henry over  heavy clusters  purplelipped irises  stood   centre   table “what do you mean  good harry” “to  good     harmony  one’s self”  replied touching  thin stem  his glass  his pale finepointed fingers “discord    forced    harmony  others one’s own life—that   important thing as   lives  one’s neighbours if one wishes    prig or  puritan one can flaunt one’s moral views about them but they  not one’s concern besides individualism  really  higher aim modern morality consists  accepting  standard  one’s age i consider   any man  culture  accept  standard  his age   form   grossest immorality” “but surely if one lives merely  one’s self harry one pays  terrible price  doing so” suggested  painter “yes we  overcharged  everything nowadays i should fancy   real tragedy   poor   they can afford nothing but selfdenial beautiful sins like beautiful things   privilege   rich” “one   pay  other ways but money” “what sort  ways basil” “oh i should fancy  remorse  suffering   well   consciousness  degradation” lord henry shrugged his shoulders “my dear fellow mediæval art  charming but mediæval emotions  out  date one can use them  fiction  course but then  only things  one can use  fiction   things  one  ceased  use  fact believe me no civilized man ever regrets  pleasure  no uncivilized man ever knows what  pleasure is” “i know what pleasure is” cried dorian gray “it   adore some one” “that  certainly better than being adored”  answered toying  some fruits “being adored   nuisance women treat us just  humanity treats  gods they worship us   always bothering us  do something  them” “i should have said  whatever they ask  they had first given  us” murmured  lad gravely “they create love  our natures they have  right  demand  back” “that  quite true dorian” cried hallward “nothing  ever quite true” said lord henry “this is” interrupted dorian “you must admit harry  women give  men  very gold  their lives” “possibly”  sighed “but they invariably want  back  such very small change that   worry women  some witty frenchman once put it inspire us   desire  do masterpieces

firebreathing silver dragon   waiter had placed   table “let us go down   theatre when sibyl comes   stage you  have  new ideal  life she  represent something  you  you have never known” “i have known everything” said lord henry   tired look  his eyes “but i am always ready   new emotion i am afraid however that  me  any rate there  no such thing still your wonderful girl may thrill me i love acting it  so much more real than life let us go dorian you  come  me i am so sorry basil but there  only room  two   brougham you must follow us   hansom” they got up  put  their coats sipping their coffee standing the painter  silent  preoccupied there   gloom over him he could not bear this marriage  yet  seemed  him   better than many other things  might have happened after  few minutes they all passed downstairs he drove off  himself  had been arranged  watched  flashing lights   little brougham  front  him a strange sense  loss came over him he felt  dorian gray would never again   him all   had been   past life had come between them his eyes darkened   crowded flaring streets became blurred  his eyes when  cab drew up   theatre  seemed  him   had grown years older chapter vii for some reason or other  house  crowded  night   fat jew manager who met them   door  beaming  ear  ear   oily tremulous smile he escorted them  their box   sort  pompous humility waving his fat jewelled hands  talking   top  his voice dorian gray loathed him more than ever he felt  if  had come  look  miranda  had been met  caliban lord henry upon  other hand rather liked him at least  declared  did  insisted  shaking him   hand  assuring him    proud  meet  man who had discovered  real genius  gone bankrupt over  poet hallward amused himself  watching  faces   pit the heat  terribly oppressive   huge sunlight flamed like  monstrous dahlia  petals  yellow fire the youths   gallery had taken off their coats  waistcoats  hung them over  side they talked  each other across  theatre  shared their oranges   tawdry girls who sat beside them some women  laughing   pit their voices  horribly shrill  discordant the sound   popping  corks came   bar “what  place  find one’s divinity in” said lord henry “yes” answered dorian gray “it  here i found her  she  divine beyond all living things when she acts you  forget everything these common rough people  their coarse faces  brutal gestures become quite different when she    stage they sit silently  watch her they weep  laugh  she wills them  do she makes them  responsive   violin she spiritualizes them  one feels  they    same flesh  blood  one’s self” “the same flesh  blood  one’s self oh i hope not” exclaimed lord henry who  scanning  occupants   gallery through his operaglass “don’t pay any attention  him dorian” said  painter “i understand what you mean  i believe  this girl any one you love must  marvellous  any girl who   effect you describe must  fine  noble to spiritualize one’s age—that  something worth doing if this girl can give  soul  those who have lived without one if she can create  sense  beauty  people whose lives have been sordid  ugly if she can strip them  their selfishness  lend them tears  sorrows   not their own she  worthy  all your adoration worthy   adoration   world this marriage  quite right i did not think so  first but i admit  now the gods made sibyl vane  you without her you would have been incomplete” “thanks basil” answered dorian gray pressing his hand “i knew  you would understand me harry  so cynical  terrifies me but here   orchestra it  quite dreadful but  only lasts  about five minutes then  curtain rises  you  see  girl  whom i am going  give all my life  whom i have given everything   good  me” a quarter   hour afterwards amidst  extraordinary turmoil  applause sibyl vane stepped    stage yes she  certainly lovely  look at—one   loveliest creatures lord henry thought   had ever seen there  something   fawn  her shy grace  startled eyes a faint blush like  shadow   rose   mirror  silver came  her cheeks  she glanced   crowded enthusiastic house she stepped back  few paces  her lips seemed  tremble basil hallward leaped  his feet  began  applaud motionless   one   dream sat dorian gray gazing  her lord henry peered through his glasses murmuring “charming charming” the scene   hall  capulet’s house  romeo  his pilgrim’s dress had entered  mercutio  his other friends the band such   was struck up  few bars  music   dance began through  crowd  ungainly shabbily dressed actors sibyl vane moved like  creature   finer world her body swayed while she danced   plant sways   water the curves  her throat   curves   white lily her hands seemed   made  cool ivory yet she  curiously listless she showed no sign  joy when her eyes rested  romeo the few words she had  speak— good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows  this for saints have hands  pilgrims’ hands do touch and palm  palm  holy palmers’ kiss—   brief dialogue  follows  spoken   thoroughly artificial manner the voice  exquisite but   point  view  tone   absolutely false it  wrong  colour it took away all  life   verse it made  passion unreal dorian gray grew pale   watched her he  puzzled  anxious neither  his friends dared  say anything  him she seemed  them   absolutely incompetent they  horribly disappointed yet they felt   true test  any juliet   balcony scene   second act they waited  that if she failed there there  nothing  her she looked charming  she came out   moonlight that could not  denied but  staginess  her acting  unbearable  grew worse  she went on her gestures became absurdly artificial she overemphasized everything  she had  say the beautiful passage— thou knowest  mask  night   my face else would  maiden blush bepaint my cheek for  which thou hast heard me speak tonight—  declaimed   painful precision   schoolgirl who  been taught  recite  some secondrate professor  elocution when she leaned over  balcony  came  those wonderful lines— although i joy  thee i have no joy  this contract tonight it  too rash too unadvised too sudden too like  lightning which doth cease   ere one can say “it lightens” sweet goodnight this bud  love  summer’s ripening breath may prove  beauteous flower when next we meet— she spoke  words  though they conveyed no meaning  her it  not nervousness indeed so far  being nervous she  absolutely selfcontained it  simply bad art she   complete failure even  common uneducated audience   pit  gallery lost their interest   play they got restless  began  talk loudly   whistle the jew manager who  standing   back   dresscircle stamped  swore  rage the only person unmoved   girl herself when  second act  over there came  storm  hisses  lord henry got up  his chair  put  his coat “she  quite beautiful dorian”  said “but she can’t act let us go” “i am going  see  play through” answered  lad   hard bitter voice “i am awfully sorry  i have made you waste  evening harry i apologize  you both” “my dear dorian i should think miss vane  ill” interrupted hallward “we  come some other night” “i wish she  ill”  rejoined “but she seems  me   simply callous  cold she  entirely altered last night she   great artist this evening she  merely  commonplace mediocre actress” “don’t talk like  about any one you love dorian love   more wonderful thing than art” “they  both simply forms  imitation” remarked lord henry “but do let us go dorian you must not stay here any longer it  not good  one’s morals  see bad acting besides i don’t suppose you  want your wife  act so what does  matter if she plays juliet like  wooden doll she  very lovely  if she knows  little about life  she does about acting she    delightful experience there  only two kinds  people who  really fascinating—people who know absolutely everything  people who know absolutely nothing good heavens my dear boy don’t look so tragic the secret  remaining young  never  have  emotion   unbecoming come   club  basil  myself we  smoke cigarettes  drink   beauty  sibyl vane she  beautiful what more can you want” “go away harry” cried  lad “i want   alone basil you must go ah can’t you see  my heart  breaking” the hot tears came  his eyes his lips trembled  rushing   back   box  leaned up against  wall hiding his face  his hands “let us go basil” said lord henry   strange tenderness  his voice   two young men passed out together a few moments afterwards  footlights flared up   curtain rose   third act dorian gray went back  his seat he looked pale  proud  indifferent the play dragged on  seemed interminable half   audience went out tramping  heavy boots  laughing the whole thing   fiasco the last act  played  almost empty benches the curtain went down   titter  some groans as soon    over dorian gray rushed behind  scenes into  greenroom the girl  standing there alone   look  triumph  her face her eyes  lit   exquisite fire there   radiance about her her parted lips  smiling over some secret  their own when  entered she looked  him   expression  infinite joy came over her “how badly i acted tonight dorian” she cried “horribly”  answered gazing  her  amazement “horribly it  dreadful are you ill you have no idea what  was you have no idea what i suffered” the girl smiled “dorian” she answered lingering over his name  longdrawn music  her voice  though   sweeter than honey   red petals  her mouth “dorian you should have understood but you understand now don’t you” “understand what”  asked angrily “why i  so bad tonight why i shall always  bad why i shall never act well again” he shrugged his shoulders “you  ill i suppose when you  ill you shouldn’t act you make yourself ridiculous my friends  bored i  bored” she seemed not  listen  him she  transfigured  joy an ecstasy  happiness dominated her “dorian dorian” she cried “before i knew you acting   one reality  my life it  only   theatre  i lived i thought    all true i  rosalind one night  portia  other the joy  beatrice  my joy   sorrows  cordelia  mine also i believed  everything the common people who acted  me seemed  me   godlike the painted scenes  my world i knew nothing but shadows  i thought them real you came—oh my beautiful love—and you freed my soul  prison you taught me what reality really is tonight   first time  my life i saw through  hollowness  sham  silliness   empty pageant  which i had always played tonight   first time i became conscious   romeo  hideous  old  painted   moonlight   orchard  false   scenery  vulgar    words i had  speak  unreal  not my words  not what i wanted  say you had brought me something higher something  which all art  but  reflection you had made me understand what love really is my love my love prince charming prince  life i have grown sick  shadows you  more  me than all art can ever be what have i  do   puppets   play when i came  tonight i could not understand how    everything had gone  me i thought  i  going   wonderful i found  i could do nothing suddenly  dawned  my soul what  all meant the knowledge  exquisite  me i heard them hissing  i smiled what could they know  love such  ours take me away dorian—take me away  you where we can  quite alone i hate  stage i might mimic  passion  i do not feel but i cannot mimic one  burns me like fire oh dorian dorian you understand now what  signifies even if i could do it  would  profanation  me  play  being  love you have made me see that” he flung himself down   sofa  turned away his face “you have killed my love”  muttered she looked  him  wonder  laughed he made no answer she came across  him   her little fingers stroked his hair she knelt down  pressed his hands  her lips he drew them away   shudder ran through him then  leaped up  went   door “yes”  cried “you have killed my love you used  stir my imagination now you don’t even stir my curiosity you simply produce no effect i loved you because you  marvellous because you had genius  intellect because you realized  dreams  great poets  gave shape  substance   shadows  art you have thrown  all away you  shallow  stupid my god how mad i   love you what  fool i have been you  nothing  me now i  never see you again i  never think  you i  never mention your name you don’t know what you   me once why once  oh i can’t bear  think  it i wish i had never laid eyes upon you you have spoiled  romance  my life how little you can know  love if you say  mars your art without your art you  nothing i would have made you famous splendid magnificent the world would have worshipped you  you would have borne my name what  you now a thirdrate actress   pretty face” the girl grew white  trembled she clenched her hands together  her voice seemed  catch  her throat “you  not serious dorian” she murmured “you  acting” “acting i leave   you you do  so well”  answered bitterly she rose  her knees and   piteous expression  pain  her face came across  room  him she put her hand upon his arm  looked into his eyes he thrust her back “don’t touch me”  cried a low moan broke  her  she flung herself  his feet  lay there like  trampled flower “dorian dorian don’t leave me” she whispered “i am so sorry i didn’t act well i  thinking  you all  time but i  try—indeed i  try it came so suddenly across me my love  you i think i should never have known  if you had not kissed me—if we had not kissed each other kiss me again my love don’t go away  me i couldn’t bear it oh don’t go away  me my brother  no never mind he didn’t mean it he   jest but you oh can’t you forgive me  tonight i  work so hard  try  improve don’t  cruel  me because i love you better than anything   world after all   only once  i have not pleased you but you  quite right dorian i should have shown myself more   artist it  foolish  me  yet i couldn’t help it oh don’t leave me don’t leave me” a fit  passionate sobbing choked her she crouched   floor like  wounded thing  dorian gray  his beautiful eyes looked down  her  his chiselled lips curled  exquisite disdain there  always something ridiculous about  emotions  people whom one  ceased  love sibyl vane seemed  him   absurdly melodramatic her tears  sobs annoyed him “i am going”  said  last  his calm clear voice “i don’t wish   unkind but i can’t see you again you have disappointed me” she wept silently  made no answer but crept nearer her little hands stretched blindly out  appeared   seeking  him he turned  his heel  left  room in  few moments   out   theatre where  went   hardly knew he remembered wandering through dimly lit streets past gaunt blackshadowed archways  evillooking houses women  hoarse voices  harsh laughter had called after him drunkards had reeled by cursing  chattering  themselves like monstrous apes he had seen grotesque children huddled upon doorsteps  heard shrieks  oaths  gloomy courts as  dawn  just breaking  found himself close  covent garden the darkness lifted and flushed  faint fires  sky hollowed itself into  perfect pearl huge carts filled  nodding lilies rumbled slowly down  polished empty street the air  heavy   perfume   flowers  their beauty seemed  bring him  anodyne  his pain he followed into  market  watched  men unloading their waggons a whitesmocked carter offered him some cherries he thanked him wondered why  refused  accept any money  them  began  eat them listlessly they had been plucked  midnight   coldness   moon had entered into them a long line  boys carrying crates  striped tulips   yellow  red roses defiled  front  him threading their way through  huge jadegreen piles  vegetables under  portico   grey sunbleached pillars loitered  troop  draggled bareheaded girls waiting   auction   over others crowded round  swinging doors   coffeehouse   piazza the heavy carthorses slipped  stamped upon  rough stones shaking their bells  trappings some   drivers  lying asleep   pile  sacks irisnecked  pinkfooted  pigeons ran about picking up seeds after  little while  hailed  hansom  drove home for  few moments  loitered upon  doorstep looking round   silent square   blank closeshuttered windows   staring blinds the sky  pure opal now   roofs   houses glistened like silver against it from some chimney opposite  thin wreath  smoke  rising it curled  violet riband through  nacrecoloured air in  huge gilt venetian lantern spoil  some doge’s barge  hung   ceiling   great oakpanelled hall  entrance lights  still burning  three flickering jets thin blue petals  flame they seemed rimmed  white fire he turned them out and having thrown his hat  cape   table passed through  library towards  door  his bedroom  large octagonal chamber   ground floor that  his newborn feeling  luxury  had just had decorated  himself  hung  some curious renaissance tapestries  had been discovered stored   disused attic  selby royal as   turning  handle   door his eye fell upon  portrait basil hallward had painted  him he started back  if  surprise then  went  into his own room looking somewhat puzzled after  had taken  buttonhole out  his coat  seemed  hesitate finally  came back went over   picture  examined it in  dim arrested light  struggled through  creamcoloured silk blinds  face appeared  him    little changed the expression looked different one would have said  there   touch  cruelty   mouth it  certainly strange he turned round and walking   window drew up  blind the bright dawn flooded  room  swept  fantastic shadows into dusky corners where they lay shuddering but  strange expression   had noticed   face   portrait seemed  linger there   more intensified even the quivering ardent sunlight showed him  lines  cruelty round  mouth  clearly  if  had been looking into  mirror after  had done some dreadful thing he winced and taking up   table  oval glass framed  ivory cupids one  lord henry’s many presents  him glanced hurriedly into  polished depths no line like  warped his red lips what did  mean he rubbed his eyes  came close   picture  examined  again there  no signs  any change when  looked into  actual painting  yet there  no doubt   whole expression had altered it  not  mere fancy  his own the thing  horribly apparent he threw himself into  chair  began  think suddenly there flashed across his mind what  had said  basil hallward’s studio  day  picture had been finished yes  remembered  perfectly he had uttered  mad wish   himself might remain young   portrait grow old  his own beauty might  untarnished   face   canvas bear  burden  his passions  his sins   painted image might  seared   lines  suffering  thought    might keep all  delicate bloom  loveliness  his then just conscious boyhood surely his wish had not been fulfilled such things  impossible it seemed monstrous even  think  them and yet there   picture before him   touch  cruelty   mouth cruelty had  been cruel it   girl’s fault not his he had dreamed  her   great artist had given his love  her because  had thought her great then she had disappointed him she had been shallow  unworthy and yet  feeling  infinite regret came over him   thought  her lying  his feet sobbing like  little child he remembered  what callousness  had watched her why had  been made like that why had such  soul been given  him but  had suffered also during  three terrible hours   play had lasted  had lived centuries  pain aeon upon aeon  torture his life  well worth hers she had marred him   moment if  had wounded her   age besides women  better suited  bear sorrow than men they lived  their emotions they only thought  their emotions when they took lovers   merely  have some one  whom they could have scenes lord henry had told him that  lord henry knew what women were why should  trouble about sibyl vane she  nothing  him now but  picture what    say  that it held  secret  his life  told his story it had taught him  love his own beauty would  teach him  loathe his own soul would  ever look   again no   merely  illusion wrought   troubled senses the horrible night   had passed had left phantoms behind it suddenly there had fallen upon his brain  tiny scarlet speck  makes men mad the picture had not changed it  folly  think so yet   watching him   beautiful marred face   cruel smile its bright hair gleamed   early sunlight its blue eyes met his own a sense  infinite pity not  himself but   painted image  himself came over him it had altered already  would alter more its gold would wither into grey its red  white roses would die for every sin   committed  stain would fleck  wreck  fairness but  would not sin the picture changed or unchanged would   him  visible emblem  conscience he would resist temptation he would not see lord henry any more—would not  any rate listen  those subtle poisonous theories   basil hallward’s garden had first stirred within him  passion  impossible things he would go back  sibyl vane make her amends marry her try  love her again yes   his duty  do so she must have suffered more than  had poor child he had been selfish  cruel  her the fascination  she had exercised over him would return they would  happy together his life  her would  beautiful  pure he got up  his chair  drew  large screen right  front   portrait shuddering   glanced  it “how horrible”  murmured  himself   walked across   window  opened it when  stepped out    grass  drew  deep breath the fresh morning air seemed  drive away all his sombre passions he thought only  sibyl a faint echo  his love came back  him he repeated her name over  over again the birds   singing   dewdrenched garden seemed   telling  flowers about her chapter viii it  long past noon when  awoke his valet had crept several times  tiptoe into  room  see if   stirring  had wondered what made his young master sleep so late finally his bell sounded  victor came  softly   cup  tea   pile  letters   small tray  old sevres china  drew back  olivesatin curtains  their shimmering blue lining  hung  front   three tall windows “monsieur  well slept this morning”  said smiling “what o’clock  it victor” asked dorian gray drowsily “one hour   quarter monsieur” how late  was he sat up  having sipped some tea turned over his letters one  them   lord henry  had been brought  hand  morning he hesitated   moment  then put  aside the others  opened listlessly they contained  usual collection  cards invitations  dinner tickets  private views programmes  charity concerts   like   showered  fashionable young men every morning during  season there   rather heavy bill   chased silver louisquinze toiletset   had not yet had  courage  send   his guardians who  extremely

any sum  money   moment’s notice    most reasonable rates  interest after about ten minutes  got up  throwing   elaborate dressinggown  silkembroidered cashmere wool passed into  onyxpaved bathroom the cool water refreshed him after his long sleep he seemed  have forgotten all   had gone through a dim sense  having taken part  some strange tragedy came  him once or twice but there   unreality   dream about it as soon    dressed  went into  library  sat down   light french breakfast  had been laid out  him   small round table close   open window it   exquisite day the warm air seemed laden  spices a bee flew   buzzed round  bluedragon bowl that filled  sulphuryellow roses stood before him he felt perfectly happy suddenly his eye fell   screen   had placed  front   portrait   started “too cold  monsieur” asked his valet putting  omelette   table “i shut  window” dorian shook his head “i am not cold”  murmured was  all true had  portrait really changed or had  been simply his own imagination  had made him see  look  evil where there had been  look  joy surely  painted canvas could not alter the thing  absurd it would serve   tale  tell basil some day it would make him smile and yet how vivid  his recollection   whole thing first   dim twilight  then   bright dawn  had seen  touch  cruelty round  warped lips he almost dreaded his valet leaving  room he knew  when   alone  would have  examine  portrait he  afraid  certainty when  coffee  cigarettes had been brought   man turned  go  felt  wild desire  tell him  remain as  door  closing behind him  called him back the man stood waiting  his orders dorian looked  him   moment “i am not  home  any one victor”  said   sigh the man bowed  retired then  rose   table lit  cigarette  flung himself down   luxuriously cushioned couch  stood facing  screen the screen   old one  gilt spanish leather stamped  wrought   rather florid louisquatorze pattern he scanned  curiously wondering if ever before  had concealed  secret   man’s life should  move  aside after all why not let  stay there what   use  knowing if  thing  true   terrible if   not true why trouble about it but what if  some fate or deadlier chance eyes other than his spied behind  saw  horrible change what should  do if basil hallward came  asked  look  his own picture basil would  sure  do that no  thing had   examined   once anything would  better than this dreadful state  doubt he got up  locked both doors at least  would  alone when  looked upon  mask  his shame then  drew  screen aside  saw himself face  face it  perfectly true the portrait had altered as  often remembered afterwards  always  no small wonder  found himself  first gazing   portrait   feeling  almost scientific interest that such  change should have taken place  incredible  him and yet    fact was there some subtle affinity between  chemical atoms  shaped themselves into form  colour   canvas   soul   within him could    what  soul thought they realized—that what  dreamed they made true or  there some other more terrible reason he shuddered  felt afraid and going back   couch lay there gazing   picture  sickened horror one thing however  felt   had done  him it had made him conscious how unjust how cruel  had been  sibyl vane it  not too late  make reparation  that she could still  his wife his unreal  selfish love would yield  some higher influence would  transformed into some nobler passion   portrait  basil hallward had painted  him would   guide  him through life would   him what holiness   some  conscience  others   fear  god  us all there  opiates  remorse drugs  could lull  moral sense  sleep but here   visible symbol   degradation  sin here   everpresent sign   ruin men brought upon their souls three o’clock struck  four   halfhour rang  double chime but dorian gray did not stir he  trying  gather up  scarlet threads  life   weave them into  pattern  find his way through  sanguine labyrinth  passion through which   wandering he did not know what  do or what  think finally  went over   table  wrote  passionate letter   girl  had loved imploring her forgiveness  accusing himself  madness he covered page after page  wild words  sorrow  wilder words  pain there   luxury  selfreproach when we blame ourselves we feel  no one else   right  blame us it   confession not  priest  gives us absolution when dorian had finished  letter  felt   had been forgiven suddenly there came  knock   door   heard lord henry’s voice outside “my dear boy i must see you let me   once i can’t bear your shutting yourself up like this” he made no answer  first but remained quite still the knocking still continued  grew louder yes   better  let lord henry in   explain  him  new life   going  lead  quarrel  him if  became necessary  quarrel  part if parting  inevitable he jumped up drew  screen hastily across  picture  unlocked  door “i am so sorry   all dorian” said lord henry   entered “but you must not think too much about it” “do you mean about sibyl vane” asked  lad “yes  course” answered lord henry sinking into  chair  slowly pulling off his yellow gloves “it  dreadful  one point  view but   not your fault tell me did you go behind  see her after  play  over” “yes” “i felt sure you had did you make  scene  her” “i  brutal harry—perfectly brutal but   all right now i am not sorry  anything   happened it  taught me  know myself better” “ah dorian i am so glad you take    way i  afraid i would find you plunged  remorse  tearing  nice curly hair  yours” “i have got through all that” said dorian shaking his head  smiling “i am perfectly happy now i know what conscience is  begin with it  not what you told me  was it   divinest thing  us don’t sneer  it harry any more—at least not before me i want   good i can’t bear  idea  my soul being hideous” “a very charming artistic basis  ethics dorian i congratulate you  it but how  you going  begin” “by marrying sibyl vane” “marrying sibyl vane” cried lord henry standing up  looking  him  perplexed amazement “but my dear dorian—” “yes harry i know what you  going  say something dreadful about marriage don’t say it don’t ever say things   kind  me again two days ago i asked sibyl  marry me i am not going  break my word  her she    my wife” “your wife dorian  didn’t you get my letter i wrote  you this morning  sent  note down  my own man” “your letter oh yes i remember i have not read  yet harry i  afraid there might  something    i wouldn’t like you cut life  pieces  your epigrams” “you know nothing then” “what do you mean” lord henry walked across  room  sitting down  dorian gray took both his hands  his own  held them tightly “dorian”  said “my letter—don’t  frightened—was  tell you  sibyl vane  dead” a cry  pain broke   lad’s lips   leaped  his feet tearing his hands away  lord henry’s grasp “dead sibyl dead it  not true it   horrible lie how dare you say it” “it  quite true dorian” said lord henry gravely “it   all  morning papers i wrote down  you  ask you not  see any one till i came there  have    inquest  course  you must not  mixed up  it things like  make  man fashionable  paris but  london people  so prejudiced here one should never make one’s début   scandal one should reserve   give  interest  one’s old age i suppose they don’t know your name   theatre if they don’t   all right did any one see you going round  her room that   important point” dorian did not answer   few moments he  dazed  horror finally  stammered   stifled voice “harry did you say  inquest what did you mean  that did sibyl— oh harry i can’t bear it but  quick tell me everything  once” “i have no doubt   not  accident dorian though  must  put   way   public it seems   she  leaving  theatre  her mother about halfpast twelve or so she said she had forgotten something upstairs they waited some time  her but she did not come down again they ultimately found her lying dead   floor  her dressingroom she had swallowed something  mistake some dreadful thing they use  theatres i don’t know what  was but  had either prussic acid or white lead  it i should fancy   prussic acid  she seems  have died instantaneously” “harry harry   terrible” cried  lad “yes   very tragic  course but you must not get yourself mixed up  it i see  the standard  she  seventeen i should have thought she  almost younger than that she looked such  child  seemed  know so little about acting dorian you mustn’t let this thing get  your nerves you must come  dine  me  afterwards we  look    opera it   patti night  everybody   there you can come  my sister’s box she  got some smart women  her” “so i have murdered sibyl vane” said dorian gray half  himself “murdered her  surely  if i had cut her little throat   knife yet  roses  not less lovely  all that the birds sing just  happily  my garden and tonight i am  dine  you  then go    opera  sup somewhere i suppose afterwards how extraordinarily dramatic life is if i had read all this   book harry i think i would have wept over it somehow now    happened actually   me  seems far too wonderful  tears here   first passionate loveletter i have ever written  my life strange  my first passionate loveletter should have been addressed   dead girl can they feel i wonder those white silent people we call  dead sibyl can she feel or know or listen oh harry how i loved her once it seems years ago  me now she  everything  me then came  dreadful night—was  really only last night—when she played so badly  my heart almost broke she explained  all  me it  terribly pathetic but i  not moved  bit i thought her shallow suddenly something happened  made me afraid i can’t tell you what  was but   terrible i said i would go back  her i felt i had done wrong and now she  dead my god my god harry what shall i do you don’t know  danger i am in  there  nothing  keep me straight she would have done   me she had no right  kill herself it  selfish  her” “my dear dorian” answered lord henry taking  cigarette  his case  producing  goldlatten matchbox “the only way  woman can ever reform  man   boring him so completely   loses all possible interest  life if you had married this girl you would have been wretched of course you would have treated her kindly one can always  kind  people about whom one cares nothing but she would have soon found out  you  absolutely indifferent  her and when  woman finds  out about her husband she either becomes dreadfully dowdy or wears very smart bonnets  some other woman’s husband   pay for i say nothing about  social mistake which would have been abject—which  course i would not have allowed—but i assure you   any case  whole thing would have been  absolute failure” “i suppose  would” muttered  lad walking up  down  room  looking horribly pale “but i thought   my duty it  not my fault  this terrible tragedy  prevented my doing what  right i remember your saying once  there   fatality about good resolutions—that they  always made too late mine certainly were” “good resolutions  useless attempts  interfere  scientific laws their origin  pure vanity their result  absolutely nil they give us now  then some  those luxurious sterile emotions  have  certain charm   weak that  all  can  said  them they  simply cheques  men draw   bank where they have no account” “harry” cried dorian gray coming over  sitting down beside him “why    i cannot feel this tragedy  much  i want to i don’t think i am heartless do you” “you have done too many foolish things during  last fortnight   entitled  give yourself  name dorian” answered lord henry  his sweet melancholy smile the lad frowned “i don’t like  explanation harry”  rejoined “but i am glad you don’t think i am heartless i am nothing   kind i know i am not and yet i must admit  this thing   happened does not affect me   should it seems  me   simply like  wonderful ending   wonderful play it  all  terrible beauty   greek tragedy  tragedy  which i took  great part but  which i have not been wounded” “it   interesting question” said lord henry who found  exquisite pleasure  playing   lad’s unconscious egotism “an extremely interesting question i fancy   true explanation  this it often happens   real tragedies  life occur  such  inartistic manner  they hurt us  their crude violence their absolute incoherence their absurd want  meaning their entire lack  style they affect us just  vulgarity affects us they give us  impression  sheer brute force  we revolt against that sometimes however  tragedy  possesses artistic elements  beauty crosses our lives if these elements  beauty  real  whole thing simply appeals  our sense  dramatic effect suddenly we find  we  no longer  actors but  spectators   play or rather we  both we watch ourselves   mere wonder   spectacle enthralls us in  present case what     really happened some one  killed herself  love  you i wish  i had ever had such  experience it would have made me  love  love   rest  my life the people who have adored me—there have not been very many but there have been some—have always insisted  living on long after i had ceased  care  them or they  care  me they have become stout  tedious  when i meet them they go   once  reminiscences that awful memory  woman what  fearful thing  is and what  utter intellectual stagnation  reveals one should absorb  colour  life but one should never remember  details details  always vulgar” “i must sow poppies  my garden” sighed dorian “there  no necessity” rejoined his companion “life  always poppies  her hands of course now  then things linger i once wore nothing but violets all through one season   form  artistic mourning   romance  would not die ultimately however  did die i forget what killed it i think   her proposing  sacrifice  whole world  me that  always  dreadful moment it fills one   terror  eternity well—would you believe it—a week ago  lady hampshire’s i found myself seated  dinner next  lady  question  she insisted  going over  whole thing again  digging up  past  raking up  future i had buried my romance   bed  asphodel she dragged  out again  assured me  i had spoiled her life i am bound  state  she ate  enormous dinner so i did not feel any anxiety but what  lack  taste she showed the one charm   past      past but women never know when  curtain  fallen they always want  sixth act   soon   interest   play  entirely over they propose  continue it if they  allowed their own way every comedy would have  tragic ending  every tragedy would culminate   farce they  charmingly artificial but they have no sense  art you  more fortunate than i am i assure you dorian  not one   women i have known would have done  me what sibyl vane did  you ordinary women always console themselves some  them do   going   sentimental colours never trust  woman who wears mauve whatever her age may be or  woman over thirtyfive who  fond  pink ribbons it always means  they have  history others find  great consolation  suddenly discovering  good qualities  their husbands they flaunt their conjugal felicity  one’s face  if    most fascinating  sins religion consoles some its mysteries have all  charm   flirtation  woman once told me  i can quite understand it besides nothing makes one so vain  being told  one   sinner conscience makes egotists  us all yes there  really no end   consolations  women find  modern life indeed i have not mentioned  most important one” “what  that harry” said  lad listlessly “oh  obvious consolation taking some one else’s admirer when one loses one’s own in good society  always whitewashes  woman but really dorian how different sibyl vane must have been  all  women one meets there  something  me quite beautiful about her death i am glad i am living   century when such wonders happen they make one believe   reality   things we all play with such  romance passion  love” “i  terribly cruel  her you forget that” “i am afraid  women appreciate cruelty downright cruelty more than anything else they have wonderfully primitive instincts we have emancipated them but they remain slaves looking  their masters all  same they love being dominated i am sure you  splendid i have never seen you really  absolutely angry but i can fancy how delightful you looked and after all you said something  me  day before yesterday  seemed  me   time   merely fanciful but  i see now  absolutely true   holds  key  everything” “what  that harry” “you said  me  sibyl vane represented  you all  heroines  romance—that she  desdemona one night  ophelia  other  if she died  juliet she came  life  imogen” “she  never come  life again now” muttered  lad burying his face  his hands “no she  never come  life she  played her last part but you must think   lonely death   tawdry dressingroom simply   strange lurid fragment  some jacobean tragedy   wonderful scene  webster or ford or cyril tourneur the girl never really lived  so she  never really died to you  least she  always  dream  phantom  flitted through shakespeare’s plays  left them lovelier   presence  reed through which shakespeare’s music sounded richer  more full  joy the moment she touched actual life she marred it   marred her  so she passed away mourn  ophelia if you like put ashes  your head because cordelia  strangled cry out against heaven because  daughter  brabantio died but don’t waste your tears over sibyl vane she  less real than they are” there   silence the evening darkened   room noiselessly   silver feet  shadows crept    garden the colours faded wearily out  things after some time dorian gray looked up “you have explained me  myself harry”  murmured  something   sigh  relief “i felt all  you have said but somehow i  afraid  it  i could not express   myself how well you know me but we  not talk again  what  happened it  been  marvellous experience that  all i wonder if life  still  store  me anything  marvellous” “life  everything  store  you dorian there  nothing  you  your extraordinary good looks  not  able  do” “but suppose harry i became haggard  old  wrinkled what then” “ah then” said lord henry rising  go “then my dear dorian you would have  fight  your victories as  is they  brought  you no you must keep your good looks we live   age  reads too much   wise   thinks too much   beautiful we cannot spare you and now you had better dress  drive down   club we  rather late   is” “i think i shall join you   opera harry i feel too tired  eat anything what   number  your sister’s box” “twentyseven i believe it    grand tier you  see her name   door but i am sorry you won’t come  dine” “i don’t feel up  it” said dorian listlessly “but i am awfully obliged  you  all  you have said  me you  certainly my best friend no one  ever understood me  you have” “we  only   beginning  our friendship dorian” answered lord henry shaking him   hand “goodbye i shall see you before ninethirty i hope remember patti  singing” as  closed  door behind him dorian gray touched  bell    few minutes victor appeared   lamps

smiling   did so  passed into his bedroom where his valet  already waiting  him an hour later     opera  lord henry  leaning over his chair chapter ix as   sitting  breakfast next morning basil hallward  shown into  room “i am so glad i have found you dorian”  said gravely “i called last night  they told me you    opera of course i knew   impossible but i wish you had left word where you had really gone to i passed  dreadful evening half afraid  one tragedy might  followed  another i think you might have telegraphed  me when you heard   first i read   quite  chance   late edition  the globe  i picked up   club i came here  once   miserable  not finding you i can’t tell you how heartbroken i am about  whole thing i know what you must suffer but where  you did you go down  see  girl’s mother for  moment i thought  following you there they gave  address   paper somewhere   euston road isn’t it but i  afraid  intruding upon  sorrow  i could not lighten poor woman what  state she must  in and her only child too what did she say about  all” “my dear basil how do i know” murmured dorian gray sipping some paleyellow wine   delicate goldbeaded bubble  venetian glass  looking dreadfully bored “i    opera you should have come  there i met lady gwendolen harry’s sister   first time we   her box she  perfectly charming  patti sang divinely don’t talk about horrid subjects if one doesn’t talk about  thing   never happened it  simply expression  harry says  gives reality  things i may mention  she  not  woman’s only child there   son  charming fellow i believe but   not   stage he   sailor or something and now tell me about yourself  what you  painting” “you went   opera” said hallward speaking very slowly    strained touch  pain  his voice “you went   opera while sibyl vane  lying dead  some sordid lodging you can talk  me  other women being charming   patti singing divinely before  girl you loved  even  quiet   grave  sleep in why man there  horrors  store   little white body  hers” “stop basil i won’t hear it” cried dorian leaping  his feet “you must not tell me about things what  done  done what  past  past” “you call yesterday  past” “what   actual lapse  time got  do  it it  only shallow people who require years  get rid   emotion a man who  master  himself can end  sorrow  easily   can invent  pleasure i don’t want     mercy  my emotions i want  use them  enjoy them   dominate them” “dorian this  horrible something  changed you completely you look exactly  same wonderful boy who day after day used  come down  my studio  sit  his picture but you  simple natural  affectionate then you   most unspoiled creature   whole world now i don’t know what  come over you you talk  if you had no heart no pity  you it  all harry’s influence i see that” the lad flushed up and going   window looked out   few moments   green flickering sunlashed garden “i owe  great deal  harry basil”  said  last “more than i owe  you you only taught me   vain” “well i am punished  that dorian—or shall  some day” “i don’t know what you mean basil”  exclaimed turning round “i don’t know what you want what do you want” “i want  dorian gray i used  paint” said  artist sadly “basil” said  lad going over  him  putting his hand  his shoulder “you have come too late yesterday when i heard  sibyl vane had killed herself—” “killed herself good heavens  there no doubt about that” cried hallward looking up  him   expression  horror “my dear basil surely you don’t think    vulgar accident of course she killed herself” the elder man buried his face  his hands “how fearful”  muttered   shudder ran through him “no” said dorian gray “there  nothing fearful about it it  one   great romantic tragedies   age as  rule people who act lead  most commonplace lives they  good husbands or faithful wives or something tedious you know what i mean—middleclass virtue  all  kind  thing how different sibyl was she lived her finest tragedy she  always  heroine the last night she played—the night you saw her—she acted badly because she had known  reality  love when she knew  unreality she died  juliet might have died she passed again into  sphere  art there  something   martyr about her her death  all  pathetic uselessness  martyrdom all  wasted beauty but  i  saying you must not think i have not suffered if you had come  yesterday   particular moment—about halfpast five perhaps or  quarter  six—you would have found me  tears even harry who  here who brought me  news  fact had no idea what i  going through i suffered immensely then  passed away i cannot repeat  emotion no one can except sentimentalists and you  awfully unjust basil you come down here  console me that  charming  you you find me consoled  you  furious how like  sympathetic person you remind me   story harry told me about  certain philanthropist who spent twenty years  his life  trying  get some grievance redressed or some unjust law altered—i forget exactly what  was finally  succeeded  nothing could exceed his disappointment he had absolutely nothing  do almost died  ennui  became  confirmed misanthrope and besides my dear old basil if you really want  console me teach me rather  forget what  happened or  see    proper artistic point  view was  not gautier who used  write about la consolation des arts i remember picking up  little vellumcovered book  your studio one day  chancing   delightful phrase well i am not like  young man you told me  when we  down  marlow together  young man who used  say  yellow satin could console one  all  miseries  life i love beautiful things  one can touch  handle old brocades green bronzes lacquerwork carved ivories exquisite surroundings luxury pomp—there  much   got  all these but  artistic temperament  they create or  any rate reveal  still more  me to become  spectator  one’s own life  harry says   escape  suffering  life i know you  surprised  my talking  you like this you have not realized how i have developed i   schoolboy when you knew me i am  man now i have new passions new thoughts new ideas i am different but you must not like me less i am changed but you must always  my friend of course i am very fond  harry but i know  you  better than  is you  not stronger—you  too much afraid  life—but you  better and how happy we used   together don’t leave me basil  don’t quarrel  me i am what i am there  nothing more   said” the painter felt strangely moved the lad  infinitely dear  him  his personality had been  great turning point  his art he could not bear  idea  reproaching him any more after all his indifference  probably merely  mood  would pass away there  so much  him   good so much  him   noble “well dorian”  said  length   sad smile “i won’t speak  you again about this horrible thing after today i only trust your name won’t  mentioned  connection  it the inquest   take place this afternoon have they summoned you” dorian shook his head   look  annoyance passed over his face   mention   word “inquest” there  something so crude  vulgar about everything   kind “they don’t know my name”  answered “but surely she did” “only my christian name   i am quite sure she never mentioned  any one she told me once  they  all rather curious  learn who i was   she invariably told them my name  prince charming it  pretty  her you must do me  drawing  sibyl basil i should like  have something more  her than  memory   few kisses  some broken pathetic words” “i  try  do something dorian if  would please you but you must come  sit  me yourself again i can’t get  without you” “i can never sit  you again basil it  impossible”  exclaimed starting back the painter stared  him “my dear boy what nonsense”  cried “do you mean  say you don’t like what i did  you where  it why have you pulled  screen  front  it let me look  it it   best thing i have ever done do take  screen away dorian it  simply disgraceful  your servant hiding my work like that i felt  room looked different  i came in” “my servant  nothing  do  it basil you don’t imagine i let him arrange my room  me he settles my flowers  me sometimes—that  all no i did  myself the light  too strong   portrait” “too strong surely not my dear fellow it   admirable place  it let me see it” and hallward walked towards  corner   room a cry  terror broke  dorian gray’s lips   rushed between  painter   screen “basil”  said looking very pale “you must not look  it i don’t wish you to” “not look  my own work you  not serious why shouldn’t i look  it” exclaimed hallward laughing “if you try  look  it basil  my word  honour i  never speak  you again  long  i live i am quite serious i don’t offer any explanation  you  not  ask  any but remember if you touch this screen everything  over between us” hallward  thunderstruck he looked  dorian gray  absolute amazement he had never seen him like this before the lad  actually pallid  rage his hands  clenched   pupils  his eyes  like disks  blue fire he  trembling all over “dorian” “don’t speak” “but what   matter of course i won’t look   if you don’t want me to”  said rather coldly turning  his heel  going over towards  window “but really  seems rather absurd  i shouldn’t see my own work especially  i am going  exhibit   paris   autumn i shall probably have  give  another coat  varnish before that so i must see  some day  why not today” “to exhibit it you want  exhibit it” exclaimed dorian gray  strange sense  terror creeping over him was  world going   shown his secret were people  gape   mystery  his life that  impossible something—he did not know what—had   done  once “yes i don’t suppose you  object  that georges petit  going  collect all my best pictures   special exhibition   rue de sèze which  open  first week  october the portrait  only  away  month i should think you could easily spare    time in fact you  sure   out  town and if you keep  always behind  screen you can’t care much about it” dorian gray passed his hand over his forehead there  beads  perspiration there he felt      brink   horrible danger “you told me  month ago  you would never exhibit it”  cried “why have you changed your mind you people who go   being consistent have just  many moods  others have the only difference   your moods  rather meaningless you can’t have forgotten  you assured me most solemnly  nothing   world would induce you  send   any exhibition you told harry exactly  same thing” he stopped suddenly   gleam  light came into his eyes he remembered  lord henry had said  him once half seriously  half  jest “if you want  have  strange quarter   hour get basil  tell you why  won’t exhibit your picture he told me why  wouldn’t     revelation  me” yes perhaps basil too had his secret he would ask him  try “basil”  said coming over quite close  looking him straight   face “we have each  us  secret let me know yours  i shall tell you mine what  your reason  refusing  exhibit my picture” the painter shuddered  spite  himself “dorian if i told you you might like me less than you do  you would certainly laugh  me i could not bear your doing either  those two things if you wish me never  look  your picture again i am content i have always you  look at if you wish  best work i have ever done   hidden   world i am satisfied your friendship  dearer  me than any fame or reputation” “no basil you must tell me” insisted dorian gray “i think i have  right  know” his feeling  terror had passed away  curiosity had taken  place he  determined  find out basil hallward’s mystery “let us sit down dorian” said  painter looking troubled “let us sit down and just answer me one question have you noticed   picture something curious—something  probably  first did not strike you but  revealed itself  you suddenly” “basil” cried  lad clutching  arms  his chair  trembling hands  gazing  him  wild startled eyes “i see you did don’t speak wait till you hear what i have  say dorian   moment i met you your personality had  most extraordinary influence over me i  dominated soul brain  power  you you became  me  visible incarnation   unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like  exquisite dream i worshipped you i grew jealous  every one  whom you spoke i wanted  have you all  myself i  only happy when i   you when you  away  me you  still present  my art of course i never let you know anything about this it would have been impossible you would not have understood it i hardly understood  myself i only knew  i had seen perfection face  face    world had become wonderful  my eyes—too wonderful perhaps   such mad worships there  peril  peril  losing them no less than  peril  keeping them weeks  weeks went on  i grew more  more absorbed  you then came  new development i had drawn you  paris  dainty armour   adonis  huntsman’s cloak  polished boarspear crowned  heavy lotusblossoms you had sat   prow  adrian’s barge gazing across  green turbid nile you had leaned over  still pool  some greek woodland  seen   water’s silent silver  marvel  your own face and  had all been what art should be—unconscious ideal  remote one day  fatal day i sometimes think i determined  paint  wonderful portrait  you  you actually are not   costume  dead ages but  your own dress   your own time whether    realism   method or  mere wonder  your own personality thus directly presented  me without mist or veil i cannot tell but i know   i worked  it every flake  film  colour seemed  me  reveal my secret i grew afraid  others would know  my idolatry i felt dorian  i had told too much  i had put too much  myself into it then    i resolved never  allow  picture   exhibited you   little annoyed but then you did not realize all   meant  me harry  whom i talked about it laughed  me but i did not mind that when  picture  finished  i sat alone  it i felt  i  right well after  few days  thing left my studio   soon  i had got rid   intolerable fascination   presence  seemed  me  i had been foolish  imagining  i had seen anything  it more than  you  extremely goodlooking   i could paint even now i cannot help feeling     mistake  think   passion one feels  creation  ever really shown   work one creates art  always more abstract than we fancy form  colour tell us  form  colour—that  all it often seems  me  art conceals  artist far more completely than  ever reveals him and so when i got this offer  paris i determined  make your portrait  principal thing  my exhibition it never occurred  me  you would refuse i see now  you  right the picture cannot  shown you must not  angry  me dorian  what i have told you as i said  harry once you  made   worshipped” dorian gray drew  long breath the colour came back  his cheeks   smile played about his lips the peril  over he  safe   time yet  could not help feeling infinite pity   painter who had just made this strange confession  him  wondered if  himself would ever  so dominated   personality   friend lord henry had  charm  being very dangerous but   all he  too clever  too cynical   really fond of would there ever  some one who would fill him   strange idolatry was  one   things  life had  store “it  extraordinary  me dorian” said hallward “that you should have seen this   portrait did you really see it” “i saw something  it”  answered “something  seemed  me very curious” “well you don’t mind my looking   thing now” dorian shook his head “you must not ask me that basil i could not possibly let you stand  front   picture” “you  some day surely” “never” “well perhaps you  right and now goodbye dorian you have been  one person  my life who  really influenced my art whatever i have done   good i owe  you ah you don’t know what  cost me  tell you all  i have told you” “my dear basil” said dorian “what have you told me simply  you felt  you admired me too much that  not even  compliment” “it  not intended   compliment it   confession now  i have made it something seems  have gone out  me perhaps one should never put one’s worship into words” “it   very disappointing confession” “why what did you expect dorian you didn’t see anything else   picture did you there  nothing else  see” “no there  nothing else  see why do you ask but you mustn’t talk about worship it  foolish you  i  friends basil  we must always remain so” “you have got harry” said  painter sadly “oh harry” cried  lad   ripple  laughter “harry spends his days  saying what  incredible  his evenings  doing what  improbable just  sort  life i would like  lead but still i don’t think i would go  harry if i   trouble i would sooner go  you basil” “you  sit  me again” “impossible” “you spoil my life   artist  refusing dorian no man comes across two ideal things few come across one” “i can’t explain   you basil but i must never sit  you again there  something fatal about  portrait it   life   own i  come  have tea  you that   just  pleasant” “pleasanter  you i am afraid” murmured hallward regretfully “and now goodbye i am sorry you won’t let me look   picture once again but  can’t  helped i quite understand what you feel about it” as  left  room dorian gray smiled  himself poor basil how little  knew   true reason and how strange   that instead  having been forced  reveal his own secret  had succeeded almost  chance  wresting  secret  his friend how much  strange confession explained  him the painter’s absurd fits  jealousy his wild devotion his extravagant panegyrics his curious reticences—he understood them all now   felt sorry there seemed  him   something tragic   friendship so coloured  romance he sighed  touched  bell the portrait must

thirtyeighth birthday   often remembered afterwards he  walking home about eleven o’clock  lord henry’s where  had been dining   wrapped  heavy furs   night  cold  foggy at  corner  grosvenor square  south audley street  man passed him   mist walking very fast    collar  his grey ulster turned up he had  bag  his hand dorian recognized him it  basil hallward a strange sense  fear  which  could not account came over him he made no sign  recognition  went  quickly   direction  his own house but hallward had seen him dorian heard him first stopping   pavement  then hurrying after him in  few moments his hand   his arm “dorian what  extraordinary piece  luck i have been waiting  you  your library ever since nine o’clock finally i took pity  your tired servant  told him  go  bed   let me out i am off  paris   midnight train  i particularly wanted  see you before i left i thought   you or rather your fur coat  you passed me but i wasn’t quite sure didn’t you recognize me” “in this fog my dear basil why i can’t even recognize grosvenor square i believe my house  somewhere about here but i don’t feel  all certain about it i am sorry you  going away  i have not seen you  ages but i suppose you   back soon” “no i am going   out  england  six months i intend  take  studio  paris  shut myself up till i have finished  great picture i have  my head however  wasn’t about myself i wanted  talk here we   your door let me come    moment i have something  say  you” “i shall  charmed but won’t you miss your train” said dorian gray languidly   passed up  steps  opened  door  his latchkey the lamplight struggled out through  fog  hallward looked  his watch “i have heaps  time”  answered “the train doesn’t go till twelvefifteen    only just eleven in fact i   my way   club  look  you when i met you you see i shan’t have any delay about luggage  i have sent  my heavy things all i have  me   this bag  i can easily get  victoria  twenty minutes” dorian looked  him  smiled “what  way   fashionable painter  travel a gladstone bag   ulster come in or  fog  get into  house and mind you don’t talk about anything serious nothing  serious nowadays at least nothing should be” hallward shook his head   entered  followed dorian into  library there   bright wood fire blazing   large open hearth the lamps  lit   open dutch silver spiritcase stood  some siphons  sodawater  large cutglass tumblers   little marqueterie table “you see your servant made me quite  home dorian he gave me everything i wanted including your best goldtipped cigarettes he   most hospitable creature i like him much better than  frenchman you used  have what  become   frenchman   bye” dorian shrugged his shoulders “i believe  married lady radley’s maid   established her  paris   english dressmaker anglomanie  very fashionable over there now i hear it seems silly   french doesn’t it but—do you know—he  not  all  bad servant i never liked him but i had nothing  complain about one often imagines things   quite absurd he  really very devoted  me  seemed quite sorry when  went away have another brandyandsoda or would you like hockandseltzer i always take hockandseltzer myself there  sure   some   next room” “thanks i won’t have anything more” said  painter taking his cap  coat off  throwing them   bag   had placed   corner “and now my dear fellow i want  speak  you seriously don’t frown like that you make  so much more difficult  me” “what   all about” cried dorian  his petulant way flinging himself down   sofa “i hope   not about myself i am tired  myself tonight i should like   somebody else” “it  about yourself” answered hallward  his grave deep voice “and i must say   you i shall only keep you half  hour” dorian sighed  lit  cigarette “half  hour”  murmured “it  not much  ask  you dorian    entirely  your own sake  i am speaking i think  right  you should know   most dreadful things  being said against you  london” “i don’t wish  know anything about them i love scandals about other people but scandals about myself don’t interest me they have not got  charm  novelty” “they must interest you dorian every gentleman  interested  his good name you don’t want people  talk  you  something vile  degraded of course you have your position  your wealth  all  kind  thing but position  wealth  not everything mind you i don’t believe these rumours  all at least i can’t believe them when i see you sin   thing  writes itself across  man’s face it cannot  concealed people talk sometimes  secret vices there  no such things if  wretched man   vice  shows itself   lines  his mouth  droop  his eyelids  moulding  his hands even somebody—i won’t mention his name but you know him—came  me last year  have his portrait done i had never seen him before  had never heard anything about him   time though i have heard  good deal since he offered  extravagant price i refused him there  something   shape  his fingers  i hated i know now  i  quite right  what i fancied about him his life  dreadful but you dorian  your pure bright innocent face  your marvellous untroubled youth—i can’t believe anything against you and yet i see you very seldom  you never come down   studio now  when i am away  you  i hear all these hideous things  people  whispering about you i don’t know what  say why  it dorian   man like  duke  berwick leaves  room   club when you enter it why    so many gentlemen  london  neither go  your house or invite you  theirs you used    friend  lord staveley i met him  dinner last week your name happened  come up  conversation  connection   miniatures you have lent   exhibition   dudley staveley curled his lip  said  you might have  most artistic tastes but  you   man whom no pureminded girl should  allowed  know  whom no chaste woman should sit   same room with i reminded him  i   friend  yours  asked him what  meant he told me he told me right out before everybody it  horrible why  your friendship so fatal  young men there   wretched boy   guards who committed suicide you  his great friend there  sir henry ashton who had  leave england   tarnished name you    inseparable what about adrian singleton  his dreadful end what about lord kent’s only son  his career i met his father yesterday  st james’s street he seemed broken  shame  sorrow what about  young duke  perth what sort  life   got now what gentleman would associate  him” “stop basil you  talking about things  which you know nothing” said dorian gray biting his lip    note  infinite contempt  his voice “you ask me why berwick leaves  room when i enter it it  because i know everything about his life not because  knows anything about mine with such blood     his veins how could his record  clean you ask me about henry ashton  young perth did i teach  one his vices   other his debauchery if kent’s silly son takes his wife   streets what    me if adrian singleton writes his friend’s name across  bill am i his keeper i know how people chatter  england the middle classes air their moral prejudices over their gross dinnertables  whisper about what they call  profligacies  their betters  order  try  pretend  they   smart society   intimate terms   people they slander in this country   enough   man  have distinction  brains  every common tongue  wag against him and what sort  lives do these people who pose  being moral lead themselves my dear fellow you forget  we    native land   hypocrite” “dorian” cried hallward “that  not  question england  bad enough i know  english society  all wrong that   reason why i want you   fine you have not been fine one   right  judge   man   effect   over his friends yours seem  lose all sense  honour  goodness  purity you have filled them   madness  pleasure they have gone down into  depths you led them there yes you led them there  yet you can smile  you  smiling now and there  worse behind i know you  harry  inseparable surely   reason if  none other you should not have made his sister’s name  byword” “take care basil you go too far” “i must speak  you must listen you shall listen when you met lady gwendolen not  breath  scandal had ever touched her is there  single decent woman  london now who would drive  her   park why even her children  not allowed  live  her then there  other stories—stories  you have been seen creeping  dawn out  dreadful houses  slinking  disguise into  foulest dens  london are they true can they  true when i first heard them i laughed i hear them now  they make me shudder what about your countryhouse   life   led there dorian you don’t know what  said about you i won’t tell you  i don’t want  preach  you i remember harry saying once  every man who turned himself into  amateur curate   moment always began  saying that  then proceeded  break his word i do want  preach  you i want you  lead such  life   make  world respect you i want you  have  clean name   fair record i want you  get rid   dreadful people you associate with don’t shrug your shoulders like that don’t  so indifferent you have  wonderful influence let    good not  evil they say  you corrupt every one  whom you become intimate     quite sufficient  you  enter  house  shame  some kind  follow after i don’t know whether   so or not how should i know but   said  you i am told things   seems impossible  doubt lord gloucester  one  my greatest friends  oxford he showed me  letter  his wife had written  him when she  dying alone  her villa  mentone your name  implicated   most terrible confession i ever read i told him    absurd—that i knew you thoroughly   you  incapable  anything   kind know you i wonder do i know you before i could answer that i should have  see your soul” “to see my soul” muttered dorian gray starting up   sofa  turning almost white  fear “yes” answered hallward gravely   deeptoned sorrow  his voice “to see your soul but only god can do that” a bitter laugh  mockery broke   lips   younger man “you shall see  yourself tonight”  cried seizing  lamp   table “come   your own handiwork why shouldn’t you look  it you can tell  world all about  afterwards if you choose nobody would believe you if they did believe you they would like me all  better  it i know  age better than you do though you  prate about  so tediously come i tell you you have chattered enough about corruption now you shall look   face  face” there   madness  pride  every word  uttered he stamped his foot upon  ground  his boyish insolent manner he felt  terrible joy   thought  some one else   share his secret    man who had painted  portrait    origin  all his shame    burdened   rest  his life   hideous memory  what  had done “yes”  continued coming closer  him  looking steadfastly into his stern eyes “i shall show you my soul you shall see  thing  you fancy only god can see” hallward started back “this  blasphemy dorian”  cried “you must not say things like that they  horrible  they don’t mean anything” “you think so” he laughed again “i know so as  what i said  you tonight i said   your good you know i have been always  stanch friend  you” “don’t touch me finish what you have  say” a twisted flash  pain shot across  painter’s face he paused   moment   wild feeling  pity came over him after all what right had   pry into  life  dorian gray if  had done  tithe  what  rumoured about him how much  must have suffered then  straightened himself up  walked over   fireplace  stood there looking   burning logs  their frostlike ashes  their throbbing cores  flame “i am waiting basil” said  young man   hard clear voice he turned round “what i have  say  this”  cried “you must give me some answer  these horrible charges   made against you if you tell me  they  absolutely untrue  beginning  end i shall believe you deny them dorian deny them can’t you see what i am going through my god don’t tell me  you  bad  corrupt  shameful” dorian gray smiled there   curl  contempt  his lips “come upstairs basil”  said quietly “i keep  diary  my life  day  day   never leaves  room  which   written i shall show   you if you come  me” “i shall come  you dorian if you wish it i see i have missed my train that makes no matter i can go tomorrow but don’t ask me  read anything tonight all i want   plain answer  my question” “that shall  given  you upstairs i could not give  here you  not have  read long” chapter xiii he passed out   room  began  ascent basil hallward following close behind they walked softly  men do instinctively  night the lamp cast fantastic shadows   wall  staircase a rising wind made some   windows rattle when they reached  top landing dorian set  lamp down   floor  taking out  key turned    lock “you insist  knowing basil”  asked   low voice “yes” “i am delighted”  answered smiling then  added somewhat harshly “you   one man   world who  entitled  know everything about me you have had more  do  my life than you think” and taking up  lamp  opened  door  went in a cold current  air passed them   light shot up   moment   flame  murky orange he shuddered “shut  door behind you”  whispered   placed  lamp   table hallward glanced round him   puzzled expression the room looked  if  had not been lived   years a faded flemish tapestry  curtained picture  old italian cassone   almost empty bookcase—that  all   seemed  contain besides  chair   table as dorian gray  lighting  halfburned candle   standing   mantelshelf  saw   whole place  covered  dust    carpet   holes a mouse ran scuffling behind  wainscoting there   damp odour  mildew “so you think    only god who sees  soul basil draw  curtain back  you  see mine” the voice  spoke  cold  cruel “you  mad dorian or playing  part” muttered hallward frowning “you won’t then i must do  myself” said  young man   tore  curtain   rod  flung    ground an exclamation  horror broke   painter’s lips   saw   dim light  hideous face   canvas grinning  him there  something   expression  filled him  disgust  loathing good heavens   dorian gray’s own face    looking at the horror whatever  was had not yet entirely spoiled  marvellous beauty there  still some gold   thinning hair  some scarlet   sensual mouth the sodden eyes had kept something   loveliness  their blue  noble curves had not yet completely passed away  chiselled nostrils   plastic throat yes   dorian himself but who had done it he seemed  recognize his own brushwork   frame  his own design the idea  monstrous yet  felt afraid he seized  lighted candle  held    picture in  lefthand corner  his own name traced  long letters  bright vermilion it  some foul parody some infamous ignoble satire he had never done that still   his own picture he knew it   felt  if his blood had changed   moment  fire  sluggish ice his own picture what did  mean why had  altered he turned  looked  dorian gray   eyes   sick man his mouth twitched  his parched tongue seemed unable  articulate he passed his hand across his forehead it  dank  clammy sweat the young man  leaning against  mantelshelf watching him   strange expression  one sees   faces  those who  absorbed   play when some great artist  acting there  neither real sorrow   nor real joy there  simply  passion   spectator  perhaps  flicker  triumph  his eyes he had taken  flower out  his coat   smelling it or pretending  do so “what does this mean” cried hallward  last his own voice sounded shrill  curious  his ears “years ago when i   boy” said dorian gray crushing  flower  his hand “you met me flattered me  taught me   vain  my good looks one day you introduced me   friend  yours who explained  me  wonder  youth  you finished  portrait  me  revealed  me  wonder  beauty in  mad moment that even now i don’t know whether i regret or not i made  wish perhaps you would call   prayer” “i remember it oh how well i remember it no  thing  impossible the room  damp mildew  got into  canvas the paints i used had some wretched mineral poison  them i tell you  thing  impossible” “ah what  impossible” murmured  young man going over   window  leaning his forehead against  cold miststained glass “you told me you had destroyed it” “i  wrong it  destroyed me” “i don’t believe   my picture” “can’t you see your ideal  it” said dorian bitterly “my ideal  you call it” “as you called it” “there  nothing evil  it nothing shameful you   me such  ideal  i shall never meet again this   face   satyr” “it   face  my soul” “christ what  thing i must have worshipped it   eyes   devil” “each  us  heaven  hell  him basil” cried dorian   wild gesture  despair hallward turned again   portrait  gazed  it “my god if   true”  exclaimed “and this  what you have done  your life why you must  worse even than those who talk against you fancy you  be” he held  light up again   canvas  examined it the surface seemed   quite undisturbed    had left it it   within apparently   foulness  horror had come through some strange quickening  inner life  leprosies  sin  slowly eating  thing away the rotting   corpse   watery grave  not so fearful his hand shook   candle fell   socket   floor  lay there sputtering he placed his foot    put  out then  flung himself into  rickety chair   standing   table  buried his face  his hands “good god dorian what  lesson what  awful lesson” there  no answer but  could hear  young man sobbing   window “pray dorian pray”  murmured “what    one  taught  say  one’s boyhood ‘lead us not into temptation forgive us our sins wash away our iniquities’ let us say  together the prayer  your pride  been answered the prayer  your repentance   answered also i worshipped you too much i am punished  it you worshipped yourself too much we  both punished” dorian gray turned slowly around  looked  him  teardimmed eyes “it  too late basil”  faltered “it  never too late dorian let us kneel down  try if we cannot remember  prayer isn’t there  verse somewhere ‘though your sins   scarlet yet i  make them  white  snow’” “those words mean nothing  me now” “hush don’t say that you have done enough evil  your life my god don’t you see  accursed thing leering  us” dorian gray glanced   picture  suddenly  uncontrollable feeling  hatred  basil hallward came over him  though  had been suggested  him   image   canvas whispered into his ear  those grinning lips the mad passions   hunted animal stirred within him   loathed  man who  seated   table more than  his whole life  had ever loathed anything he glanced wildly around something glimmered   top   painted chest  faced him his eye fell  it he knew what  was it   knife   had brought up some days before  cut  piece  cord  had forgotten  take away  him he moved slowly towards it passing hallward   did so as soon   got behind him  seized   turned round hallward stirred  his chair  if   going  rise he rushed  him  dug  knife into  great vein   behind  ear crushing  man’s head down   table  stabbing again  again there   stifled groan   horrible sound  some one choking  blood three times  outstretched arms shot up convulsively waving grotesque stifffingered hands   air he stabbed him twice more but  man did not move something began  trickle   floor he waited   moment still pressing  head down then  threw  knife   table  listened he could hear nothing but  drip drip   threadbare carpet he opened  door  went out   landing the house  absolutely quiet no one  about for  few seconds  stood bending over  balustrade  peering down into  black seething well  darkness then  took out  key  returned   room locking himself    did so the thing  still seated   chair straining over  table  bowed head  humped back  long fantastic arms had  not been   red jagged tear   neck   clotted black pool   slowly widening   table one would have said   man  simply asleep how quickly  had all been done he felt strangely calm  walking over   window opened   stepped out   balcony the wind had blown  fog away   sky  like  monstrous peacock’s tail starred  myriads  golden eyes he looked down  saw  policeman going his rounds  flashing  long beam  his lantern   doors   silent houses the crimson spot   prowling hansom gleamed   corner  then vanished a woman   fluttering shawl  creeping slowly   railings staggering  she went now  then she stopped  peered back once she began  sing   hoarse voice the policeman strolled over  said something  her she stumbled away laughing a bitter blast swept across  square the gaslamps flickered  became blue   leafless trees shook their black iron branches   fro he shivered  went back closing  window behind him having reached  door  turned  key  opened it he did not even glance   murdered man he felt   secret   whole thing  not  realize  situation the friend who had painted  fatal portrait  which all his misery had been due had gone out  his life that  enough then  remembered  lamp it   rather curious one  moorish workmanship made  dull silver inlaid  arabesques  burnished steel  studded  coarse turquoises perhaps  might  missed  his servant  questions would  asked he hesitated   moment then  turned back  took    table he could not help seeing  dead thing how still  was how horribly white  long hands looked it  like  dreadful wax image having locked  door behind him  crept quietly downstairs the woodwork creaked  seemed  cry out  if  pain he stopped several times  waited no everything  still it  merely  sound  his own footsteps when  reached  library  saw  bag  coat   corner they must  hidden away somewhere he unlocked  secret press     wainscoting  press  which  kept his own curious disguises  put them into it he could easily burn them afterwards then  pulled out his watch it  twenty minutes  two he sat down  began  think every year—every month almost—men  strangled  england  what  had done there had been  madness  murder   air some red star had come too close   earth and yet what evidence  there against him basil hallward had left  house  eleven no one had seen him come  again most   servants   selby royal his valet had gone  bed paris yes it   paris  basil had gone    midnight train   had intended with his curious reserved habits  would  months before any suspicions would  roused months everything could  destroyed long before then a sudden thought struck him he put  his fur coat  hat  went out into  hall there  paused hearing  slow heavy tread   policeman   pavement outside  seeing  flash   bull’seye reflected   window he waited  held his breath after  few moments  drew back  latch  slipped out shutting  door very gently behind him then  began ringing  bell in about five minutes his valet appeared halfdressed  looking very drowsy “i am sorry  have had  wake you up francis”  said stepping in “but i had forgotten my latchkey what time  it” “ten minutes past two sir” answered  man looking   clock  blinking “ten minutes past two how horribly late you must wake me  nine tomorrow i have some work  do” “all right sir” “did any one call this evening” “mr hallward sir he stayed here till eleven  then  went away  catch his train” “oh i am sorry i didn’t see him did  leave any message” “no sir except   would write  you  paris if  did not find you   club” “that  do francis don’t forget  call me  nine tomorrow” “no sir” the man shambled down  passage  his slippers dorian gray threw his hat  coat upon  table  passed into  library for  quarter   hour  walked up  down  room biting his lip  thinking then  took down  blue book  one   shelves  began  turn over  leaves “alan campbell  hertford street mayfair” yes    man  wanted chapter xiv at nine o’clock  next morning his servant came    cup  chocolate   tray  opened  shutters dorian  sleeping quite peacefully lying  his right side  one hand underneath his cheek he looked like  boy who had been tired out  play or study the man had  touch him twice   shoulder before  woke    opened his eyes  faint smile passed across his lips  though  had been lost  some delightful dream yet  had not dreamed  all his night had been untroubled  any images  pleasure or  pain but youth smiles without any reason it  one   chiefest charms he turned round  leaning upon his elbow began  sip his chocolate the mellow november sun came streaming into  room the sky  bright  there   genial warmth   air it  almost like  morning  may gradually  events   preceding night crept  silent bloodstained feet into his brain  reconstructed themselves there  terrible distinctness he winced   memory  all   had suffered    moment  same curious feeling  loathing  basil hallward  had made him kill him   sat   chair came back  him   grew cold  passion the dead man  still sitting there too    sunlight now how horrible  was such hideous things    darkness not   day he felt  if  brooded  what  had gone through  would sicken or grow mad there  sins whose fascination  more   memory than   doing  them strange triumphs  gratified  pride more than  passions  gave   intellect  quickened sense  joy greater than any joy they brought or could ever bring   senses but this  not one  them it   thing   driven out   mind   drugged  poppies   strangled lest  might strangle one itself when  halfhour struck  passed his hand across his forehead  then got up hastily  dressed himself  even more than his usual care giving  good deal  attention   choice  his necktie  scarfpin  changing his rings more than once he spent  long time also over breakfast tasting  various dishes talking  his valet about some new liveries    thinking  getting made   servants  selby  going through his correspondence at some   letters  smiled three  them bored him one  read several times over  then tore up   slight look  annoyance  his face “that awful thing  woman’s memory”  lord henry had once said after  had drunk his cup  black coffee  wiped his lips slowly   napkin motioned  his servant  wait  going over   table sat down  wrote two letters one  put  his pocket  other  handed   valet “take this round   hertford street francis  if mr campbell  out  town get his address” as soon    alone  lit  cigarette  began sketching upon  piece  paper drawing first flowers  bits  architecture  then human faces suddenly  remarked  every face   drew seemed  have  fantastic likeness  basil hallward he frowned  getting up went over   bookcase  took out  volume  hazard he  determined   would not think about what had happened until  became absolutely necessary   should do so when  had stretched himself   sofa  looked   titlepage   book it  gautier’s “Émaux et camées” charpentier’s japanesepaper edition   jacquemart etching the binding   citrongreen leather   design  gilt trelliswork  dotted pomegranates it had been given  him  adrian singleton as  turned over  pages his eye fell   poem about  hand  lacenaire  cold yellow hand “du supplice encore mal lavée”   downy red hairs   “doigts de faune” he glanced  his own white taper fingers shuddering slightly  spite  himself  passed on till  came  those lovely stanzas upon venice sur une gamme chromatique le sein de perles ruisselant la vénus de l’adriatique sort de l’eau son corps rose et blanc les dômes sur l’azur des ondes suivant la phrase au pur contour s’enflent comme des gorges rondes que soulève

waterways   pink  pearl city seated   black gondola  silver prow  trailing curtains the mere lines looked  him like those straight lines  turquoiseblue  follow one  one pushes out   lido the sudden flashes  colour reminded him   gleam   opalandiristhroated birds  flutter round  tall honeycombed campanile or stalk  such stately grace through  dim duststained arcades leaning back  halfclosed eyes  kept saying over  over  himself “devant une façade rose sur le marbre d’un escalier” the whole  venice   those two lines he remembered  autumn   had passed there   wonderful love  had stirred him  mad delightful follies there  romance  every place but venice like oxford had kept  background  romance and   true romantic background  everything or almost everything basil had been  him part   time  had gone wild over tintoret poor basil what  horrible way   man  die he sighed  took up  volume again  tried  forget he read   swallows  fly   out   little café  smyrna where  hadjis sit counting their

lotuscovered nile where there  sphinxes  rosered ibises  white vultures  gilded claws  crocodiles  small beryl eyes  crawl over  green steaming mud  began  brood over those verses which drawing music  kissstained marble tell   curious statue  gautier compares   contralto voice  “monstre charmant”  couches   porphyryroom   louvre but after  time  book fell  his hand he grew nervous   horrible fit  terror came over him what if alan campbell should  out  england days would elapse before  could come back perhaps  might refuse  come what could  do then every moment   vital importance they had been great friends once five years before—almost inseparable indeed then  intimacy had come suddenly   end when they met  society now   only dorian gray who smiled alan campbell never did he   extremely clever young man though  had no real appreciation   visible arts  whatever little sense   beauty  poetry  possessed  had gained entirely  dorian his dominant intellectual passion   science at cambridge  had spent  great deal  his time working   laboratory  had taken  good class   natural science tripos  his year indeed   still devoted   study  chemistry  had  laboratory  his own  which  used  shut himself up all day long greatly   annoyance  his mother who had set her heart  his standing  parliament  had  vague idea   chemist   person who made up prescriptions he   excellent musician however  well  played both  violin   piano better than most amateurs in fact   music  had first brought him  dorian gray together—music   indefinable attraction  dorian seemed   able  exercise whenever  wished—and indeed exercised often without being conscious  it they had met  lady berkshire’s  night  rubinstein played there  after  used   always seen together   opera  wherever good music  going on for eighteen months their intimacy lasted campbell  always either  selby royal or  grosvenor square to him   many others dorian gray   type  everything   wonderful  fascinating  life whether or not  quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew but suddenly people remarked  they scarcely spoke when they met   campbell seemed always  go away early  any party  which dorian gray  present he had changed too—was strangely melancholy  times appeared almost  dislike hearing music  would never himself play giving  his excuse when   called upon    so absorbed  science   had no time left  which  practise and this  certainly true every day  seemed  become more interested  biology  his name appeared once or twice  some   scientific reviews  connection  certain curious experiments this   man dorian gray  waiting for every second  kept glancing   clock as  minutes went   became horribly agitated at last  got up  began  pace up  down  room looking like  beautiful caged thing he took long stealthy strides his hands  curiously cold the suspense became unbearable time seemed  him   crawling  feet  lead while   monstrous winds  being swept towards  jagged edge  some black cleft  precipice he knew what  waiting  him there saw it indeed and shuddering crushed  dank hands his burning lids  though  would have robbed  very brain  sight  driven  eyeballs back into their cave it  useless the brain had  own food  which  battened   imagination made grotesque  terror twisted  distorted   living thing  pain danced like some foul puppet   stand  grinned through moving masks then suddenly time stopped  him yes  blind slowbreathing thing crawled no more  horrible thoughts time being dead raced nimbly   front  dragged  hideous future   grave  showed   him he stared  it its very horror made him stone at last  door opened  his servant entered he turned glazed eyes upon him “mr campbell sir” said  man a sigh  relief broke  his parched lips   colour came back  his cheeks “ask him  come   once francis” he felt    himself again his mood  cowardice had passed away the man bowed  retired in  few moments alan campbell walked in looking very stern  rather pale his pallor being intensified  his coalblack hair  dark eyebrows “alan this  kind  you i thank you  coming” “i had intended never  enter your house again gray but you said    matter  life  death” his voice  hard  cold he spoke  slow deliberation there   look  contempt   steady searching gaze   turned  dorian he kept his hands   pockets  his astrakhan coat  seemed not  have noticed  gesture  which  had been greeted “yes    matter  life  death alan   more than one person sit down” campbell took  chair   table  dorian sat opposite  him the two men’s eyes met in dorian’s there  infinite pity he knew  what   going  do  dreadful after  strained moment  silence  leaned across  said very quietly but watching  effect  each word upon  face  him  had sent for “alan   locked room   top  this house  room  which nobody

“stop gray i don’t want  know anything further whether what you have told me  true or not true doesn’t concern me i entirely decline   mixed up  your life keep your horrible secrets  yourself they

but who drove him  it you i should fancy” “do you still refuse  do this  me” “of course i refuse i  have absolutely nothing  do  it i don’t care what shame comes  you you deserve  all i should not

don’t affect you if  some hideous dissectingroom or fetid laboratory you found this man lying   leaden table  red gutters scooped out     blood  flow through you would simply look upon him   admirable

dorian—they  dead” “the dead linger sometimes the man upstairs  not go away he  sitting   table  bowed head  outstretched arms alan alan if you don’t come  my assistance i am ruined why they  hang me alan don’t you understand they  hang me  what i have done” “there  no good  prolonging this scene i absolutely refuse  do anything   matter it  insane  you  ask me” “you refuse” “yes” “i entreat you alan” “it  useless” the same look  pity came into dorian gray’s eyes then  stretched out his hand took  piece  paper  wrote something  it he read  over twice folded  carefully  pushed  across  table having done this  got up  went over   window campbell looked  him  surprise  then took up  paper  opened it as  read it his face became ghastly pale   fell back  his chair a horrible sense  sickness came over him he felt  if his heart  beating itself  death  some empty hollow after two or three minutes  terrible silence dorian turned round  came  stood behind him putting his hand upon his shoulder “i am so sorry  you alan”  murmured “but you leave me no alternative i have  letter written already here  is you see  address if you don’t help me i must send it if you don’t help me i  send it you know what  result  be but you  going  help me it  impossible  you  refuse now i tried  spare you you  do me  justice  admit that you  stern harsh offensive you treated me  no man  ever dared  treat me—no living man  any rate i bore  all now    me  dictate terms” campbell buried his face  his hands   shudder passed through him “yes   my turn  dictate terms alan you know what they are the thing  quite simple come don’t work yourself into this fever the thing    done face it  do it” a groan broke  campbell’s lips   shivered all over the ticking   clock   mantelpiece seemed  him   dividing time into separate atoms  agony each  which  too terrible   borne he felt  if  iron ring  being slowly tightened round his forehead  if  disgrace  which   threatened had already come upon him the hand upon his shoulder weighed like  hand  lead it  intolerable it seemed  crush him “come alan you must decide  once” “i cannot do it”  said mechanically  though words could alter things “you must you have no choice don’t delay” he hesitated  moment “is there  fire   room upstairs” “yes there   gasfire  asbestos” “i shall have  go home  get some things   laboratory” “no alan you must not leave  house write out   sheet  notepaper what you want  my servant  take  cab  bring  things back  you” campbell scrawled  few lines blotted them  addressed  envelope  his assistant dorian took  note up  read  carefully then  rang  bell  gave   his valet  orders  return  soon  possible   bring  things  him as  hall door shut campbell started nervously  having got up   chair went over   chimneypiece he  shivering   kind  ague for nearly twenty minutes neither   men spoke a fly buzzed noisily about  room   ticking   clock  like  beat   hammer as  chime struck one campbell turned round  looking  dorian gray saw  his eyes  filled  tears there  something   purity  refinement   sad face  seemed  enrage him “you  infamous absolutely infamous”  muttered “hush alan you have saved my life” said dorian “your life good heavens what  life  is you have gone  corruption  corruption  now you have culminated  crime in doing what i am going  do—what you force me  do—it  not  your life  i am thinking” “ah alan” murmured dorian   sigh “i wish you had  thousandth part   pity  me  i have  you” he turned away   spoke  stood looking out   garden campbell made no answer after about ten minutes  knock came   door   servant entered carrying  large mahogany chest  chemicals   long coil  steel  platinum wire  two rather curiously shaped iron clamps “shall i leave  things here sir”  asked campbell “yes” said dorian “and i am afraid francis  i have another errand  you what   name   man  richmond who supplies selby  orchids” “harden sir” “yes—harden you must go down  richmond  once see harden personally  tell him  send twice  many orchids  i ordered   have  few white ones  possible in fact i don’t want any white ones it   lovely day francis  richmond   very pretty place—otherwise i wouldn’t bother you about it” “no trouble sir at what time shall i  back” dorian looked  campbell “how long  your experiment take alan”  said   calm indifferent voice the presence   third person   room seemed  give him extraordinary courage campbell frowned  bit his lip “it  take about five hours”  answered “it   time enough then if you  back  halfpast seven francis or stay just leave my things out  dressing you can have  evening  yourself i am not dining  home so i shall not want you” “thank you sir” said  man leaving  room “now alan there  not  moment   lost how heavy this chest is i’ll take   you you bring  other things” he spoke rapidly    authoritative manner campbell felt dominated  him they left  room together when they reached  top landing dorian took out  key  turned    lock then  stopped   troubled look came into his eyes he shuddered “i don’t think i can go in alan”  murmured “it  nothing  me i don’t require you” said campbell coldly dorian half opened  door as  did so  saw  face  his portrait leering   sunlight on  floor  front    torn curtain  lying he remembered   night before  had forgotten   first time  his life  hide  fatal canvas   about  rush forward when  drew back   shudder what   loathsome red dew  gleamed wet  glistening  one   hands  though  canvas had sweated blood how horrible  was—more horrible  seemed  him   moment than  silent thing   knew  stretched across  table  thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow   spotted carpet showed him   had not stirred but  still there   had left it he heaved  deep breath opened  door  little wider   halfclosed eyes  averted head walked quickly in determined   would not look even once upon  dead man then stooping down  taking up  goldandpurple hanging  flung  right over  picture there  stopped feeling afraid  turn round  his eyes fixed themselves   intricacies   pattern before him he heard campbell bringing   heavy chest   irons   other things   had required  his dreadful work he began  wonder if   basil hallward had ever met and if so what they had thought  each other “leave me now” said  stern voice behind him he turned  hurried out just conscious   dead man had been thrust back into  chair   campbell  gazing into  glistening yellow face as   going downstairs  heard  key being turned   lock it  long after seven when campbell came back into  library he  pale but absolutely calm “i have done what you asked me  do”  muttered “and now goodbye let us never see each other again” “you have saved me  ruin alan i cannot forget that” said dorian simply as soon  campbell had left  went upstairs there   horrible smell  nitric acid   room but  thing  had been sitting   table  gone chapter xv that evening  eightthirty exquisitely dressed  wearing  large buttonhole  parma violets dorian gray  ushered into lady narborough’s drawingroom  bowing servants his forehead  throbbing  maddened nerves   felt wildly excited but his manner   bent over his hostess’s hand   easy  graceful  ever perhaps one never seems so much  one’s ease  when one   play  part certainly no one looking  dorian gray  night could have believed   had passed through  tragedy  horrible  any tragedy  our age those finely shaped fingers could never have clutched  knife  sin nor those smiling lips have cried out  god  goodness he himself could not help wondering   calm  his demeanour    moment felt keenly  terrible pleasure   double life it   small party got up rather   hurry  lady narborough who   very clever woman  what lord henry used  describe   remains  really remarkable ugliness she had proved  excellent wife  one  our most tedious ambassadors  having buried her husband properly   marble mausoleum which she had herself designed  married off her daughters  some rich rather elderly men she devoted herself now   pleasures  french fiction french cookery  french esprit when she could get it dorian  one  her especial favourites  she always told him  she  extremely glad she had not met him  early life “i know my dear i should have fallen madly  love  you” she used  say “and thrown my bonnet right over  mills  your sake it  most fortunate  you  not thought    time as  was our bonnets  so unbecoming   mills  so occupied  trying  raise  wind  i never had even  flirtation  anybody however   all narborough’s fault he  dreadfully shortsighted  there  no pleasure  taking   husband who never sees anything” her guests this evening  rather tedious the fact was  she explained  dorian behind  very shabby fan one  her married daughters had come up quite suddenly  stay  her and  make matters worse had actually brought her husband  her “i think   most unkind  her my dear” she whispered “of course i go  stay  them every summer after i come  homburg but then  old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes  besides i really wake them up you don’t know what  existence they lead down there it  pure unadulterated country life they get up early because they have so much  do  go  bed early because they have so little  think about there  not been  scandal   neighbourhood since  time  queen elizabeth  consequently they all fall asleep after dinner you shan’t sit next either  them you shall sit  me  amuse me” dorian murmured  graceful compliment  looked round  room yes   certainly  tedious party two   people  had never seen before   others consisted  ernest harrowden one  those middleaged mediocrities so common  london clubs who have no enemies but  thoroughly disliked  their friends lady ruxton  overdressed woman  fortyseven   hooked nose who  always trying  get herself compromised but  so peculiarly plain   her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against her mrs erlynne  pushing nobody   delightful lisp  venetianred hair lady alice chapman his hostess’s daughter  dowdy dull girl  one  those characteristic british faces that once seen  never remembered  her husband  redcheeked whitewhiskered creature who like so many  his class  under  impression  inordinate joviality can atone   entire lack  ideas he  rather sorry  had come till lady narborough looking   great ormolu gilt clock  sprawled  gaudy curves   mauvedraped mantelshelf exclaimed “how horrid  henry wotton   so late i sent round  him this morning  chance   promised faithfully not  disappoint me” it  some consolation  harry    there  when  door opened   heard his slow musical voice lending charm  some insincere apology  ceased  feel bored but  dinner  could not eat anything plate after plate went away untasted lady narborough kept scolding him  what she called “an insult  poor adolphe who invented  menu specially  you”  now  then lord henry looked across  him wondering  his silence  abstracted manner from time  time  butler filled his glass  champagne he drank eagerly  his thirst seemed  increase “dorian” said lord henry  last   chaudfroid  being handed round “what   matter  you tonight you  quite out  sorts” “i believe    love” cried lady narborough “and    afraid  tell me  fear i should  jealous he  quite right i certainly should” “dear lady narborough” murmured dorian smiling “i have not been  love   whole week—not  fact since madame de ferrol left town” “how you men can fall  love   woman” exclaimed  old lady “i really cannot understand it” “it  simply because she remembers you when you   little girl lady narborough” said lord henry “she   one link between us  your short frocks” “she does not remember my short frocks  all lord henry but i remember her very well  vienna thirty years ago  how décolletée she  then” “she  still décolletée”  answered taking  olive  his long fingers “and when she    very smart gown she looks like  édition de luxe   bad french novel she  really wonderful  full  surprises her capacity  family affection  extraordinary when her third husband died her hair turned quite gold  grief” “how can you harry” cried dorian “it   most romantic explanation” laughed  hostess “but her third husband lord henry you don’t mean  say ferrol   fourth” “certainly lady narborough” “i don’t believe  word  it” “well ask mr gray he  one  her most intimate friends” “is  true mr gray” “she assures me so lady narborough” said dorian “i asked her whether like marguerite de navarre she had their hearts embalmed  hung  her girdle she told me she didn’t because none  them had had any hearts  all” “four husbands upon my word   trop de zêle” “trop d’audace i tell her” said dorian “oh she  audacious enough  anything my dear and what  ferrol like i don’t know him” “the husbands  very beautiful women belong   criminal classes” said lord henry sipping his wine lady narborough hit him  her fan “lord henry i am not  all surprised   world says  you  extremely wicked” “but what world says that” asked lord henry elevating his eyebrows “it can only   next world this world  i   excellent terms” “everybody i know says you  very wicked” cried  old lady shaking her head lord henry looked serious  some moments “it  perfectly monstrous”  said  last “the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one’s back   absolutely  entirely true” “isn’t  incorrigible” cried dorian leaning forward  his chair “i hope so” said his hostess laughing “but really if you all worship madame de ferrol  this ridiculous way i shall have  marry again so      fashion” “you  never marry again lady narborough” broke  lord henry “you  far too happy when  woman marries again   because she detested her first husband when  man marries again   because  adored his first wife women try their luck men risk theirs” “narborough wasn’t perfect” cried  old lady “if  had been you would not have loved him my dear lady”   rejoinder “women love us  our defects if we have enough  them they  forgive us everything even our intellects you  never ask me  dinner again after saying this i am afraid lady narborough but   quite true” “of course   true lord henry if we women did not love you  your defects where would you all be not one  you would ever  married you would   set  unfortunate bachelors not however   would alter you much nowadays all  married men live like bachelors  all  bachelors like married men” “fin de siêcle” murmured lord henry “fin du globe” answered his hostess “i wish   fin du globe” said dorian   sigh “life   great disappointment” “ah my dear” cried lady narborough putting  her gloves “don’t tell me  you have exhausted life when  man says  one knows  life  exhausted him lord henry  very wicked  i sometimes wish  i had been but you  made   good—you look so good i must find you  nice wife lord henry don’t you think  mr gray should get married” “i am always telling him so lady narborough” said lord henry   bow “well we must look out   suitable match  him i shall go through debrett carefully tonight  draw out  list  all  eligible young ladies” “with their ages lady narborough” asked dorian “of course  their ages slightly edited but nothing must  done   hurry i want    what the morning post calls  suitable alliance  i want you both   happy” “what nonsense people talk about happy marriages” exclaimed lord henry “a man can  happy  any woman  long   does not love her” “ah what  cynic you are” cried  old lady pushing back her chair  nodding  lady ruxton “you must come  dine  me soon again you  really  admirable tonic much better than what sir andrew prescribes  me you must tell me what people you would like  meet though i want     delightful gathering” “i like men who have  future  women who have  past”  answered “or do you think  would make   petticoat party” “i fear so” she said laughing  she stood up “a thousand pardons my dear lady ruxton” she added “i didn’t see you hadn’t finished your cigarette” “never mind lady narborough i smoke  great deal too much i am going  limit myself   future” “pray don’t lady ruxton” said lord henry “moderation   fatal thing enough   bad   meal more than enough   good   feast” lady ruxton glanced  him curiously “you must come  explain   me some afternoon lord henry it sounds  fascinating theory” she murmured  she swept out   room “now mind you don’t stay too long over your politics  scandal” cried lady narborough   door “if you do we  sure  squabble upstairs” the men laughed  mr chapman got up solemnly   foot   table  came up   top dorian gray changed his seat  went  sat  lord henry mr chapman began  talk   loud voice

years  monmouth must have been like eternity  time thrown in who else  coming” “oh  willoughbys lord rugby  his wife our hostess geoffrey clouston  usual set i have asked lord grotrian” “i like him” said lord henry “a great many people don’t but i find him charming he atones  being occasionally somewhat overdressed  being always absolutely overeducated he   very modern type” “i don’t know if

odour  opium met him he heaved  deep breath  his nostrils quivered  pleasure when  entered  young man  smooth yellow hair who  bending over  lamp lighting  long thin pipe looked up  him  nodded   hesitating manner “you here adrian” muttered dorian “where else should i be”  answered listlessly “none   chaps  speak  me now” “i thought you had left england” “darlington  not going  do anything my brother paid  bill  last george doesn’t speak  me either i don’t care”  added   sigh “as long  one  this stuff one doesn’t want friends i think i have had too many friends” dorian winced  looked round   grotesque things  lay  such fantastic postures   ragged mattresses the twisted limbs  gaping mouths  staring lustreless eyes fascinated him he knew  what strange heavens they  suffering  what dull hells  teaching them  secret  some new joy they  better off than  was he  prisoned  thought memory like  horrible malady  eating his soul away from time  time  seemed  see  eyes  basil hallward looking  him yet  felt  could not stay the presence  adrian singleton troubled him he wanted   where no one would know who  was he wanted  escape  himself “i am going    other place”  said after  pause “on  wharf” “yes” “that madcat  sure   there they won’t have her  this place now” dorian shrugged his shoulders “i am sick  women who love one women who hate one  much more interesting besides  stuff  better” “much  same” “i like  better come  have something  drink i must have something” “i don’t want anything” murmured  young man “never mind” adrian singleton rose up wearily  followed dorian   bar a halfcaste   ragged turban   shabby ulster grinned  hideous greeting   thrust  bottle  brandy  two tumblers  front  them the women sidled up  began  chatter dorian turned his back  them  said something   low voice  adrian singleton a crooked smile like  malay crease writhed across  face  one   women “we  very proud tonight” she sneered “for god’s sake don’t talk  me” cried dorian stamping his foot   ground “what do you want money here  is don’t ever talk  me again” two red sparks flashed   moment   woman’s sodden eyes then flickered out  left them dull  glazed she tossed her head  raked  coins off  counter  greedy fingers her companion watched her enviously “it’s no use” sighed adrian singleton “i don’t care  go back what does  matter i am quite happy here” “you  write  me if you want anything won’t you” said dorian after  pause “perhaps” “good night then” “good night” answered  young man passing up  steps  wiping his parched mouth   handkerchief dorian walked   door

“don’t call me that” she snapped her fingers “prince charming  what you like   called ain’t it” she yelled after him the drowsy sailor leaped  his feet  she spoke  looked wildly round the sound   shutting   hall door fell  his ear he rushed out  if  pursuit dorian gray hurried along  quay through  drizzling rain his meeting  adrian singleton had strangely moved him   wondered if  ruin   young life  really   laid  his door  basil hallward had said  him  such infamy  insult he bit his lip    few seconds his eyes grew sad yet after all what did  matter  him one’s days  too brief  take  burden

must do my job first one minute that’s all” dorian’s arms fell  his side paralysed  terror  did not know what  do suddenly  wild hope flashed across his brain “stop”  cried “how long ago   since your sister died quick tell me” “eighteen years” said  man “why do you ask me what do years matter” “eighteen years” laughed dorian gray   touch  triumph  his voice “eighteen years set me under  lamp  look

dorian gray drew  long breath “you have been   brink  committing  terrible crime my man”  said looking  him sternly “let this   warning  you not  take vengeance into your own hands” “forgive me sir” muttered james vane “i  deceived a chance word i heard   damned den set me   wrong track” “you had better go home  put  pistol away or you may get into trouble” said dorian turning  his heel  going slowly down  street james vane stood   pavement  horror he  trembling  head  foot after  little while  black shadow  had been creeping along  dripping wall moved out into  light  came close  him  stealthy footsteps he felt  hand laid  his arm  looked round   start it  one   women who had been drinking   bar “why didn’t you kill him” she hissed out putting haggard face quite close  his “i knew

life the man whose life i want must  nearly forty now this one  little more than  boy thank god i have not got his blood upon my hands” the woman gave  bitter laugh “little more than  boy” she sneered “why man it’s nigh  eighteen years since prince charming made me what i am” “you lie” cried james vane she raised her hand up  heaven “before god i am telling  truth” she cried “before god” “strike me

married me  purely scientific principles   best specimen  could find   modern butterfly” “well i hope  won’t stick pins into you duchess” laughed dorian “oh my maid does  already mr gray when she  annoyed  me” “and what does she get annoyed  you about duchess” “for  most trivial things mr gray i assure you usually because i come   ten minutes  nine  tell her  i must  dressed  halfpast eight” “how unreasonable  her you should give her warning” “i daren’t mr gray why she invents hats  me you remember  one i wore  lady hilstone’s gardenparty you don’t but   nice  you  pretend  you do well she made  out  nothing all good hats  made out  nothing” “like all good reputations gladys” interrupted lord henry “every effect  one produces gives one  enemy to  popular one must   mediocrity” “not  women” said  duchess shaking her head “and women rule  world i assure you we can’t bear mediocrities we women  some one says love  our ears just  you men love  your eyes if you ever love  all” “it seems  me  we never do anything else” murmured dorian “ah then you never really love mr gray” answered  duchess  mock sadness “my dear gladys” cried lord henry “how can you say that romance lives  repetition  repetition converts  appetite into  art besides each time  one loves   only time one  ever loved difference  object does not alter singleness  passion it merely intensifies it we can have  life but one great experience  best   secret  life   reproduce  experience  often  possible” “even when one  been wounded  it harry” asked  duchess after  pause “especially when one  been wounded  it” answered lord henry the duchess turned  looked  dorian gray   curious expression  her eyes “what do you say  that mr gray” she inquired dorian hesitated   moment then  threw his head back  laughed “i always agree  harry duchess” “even when   wrong” “harry  never wrong duchess” “and does his philosophy make you happy” “i have never searched  happiness who wants happiness i have searched  pleasure” “and found it mr gray” “often too often” the duchess sighed “i am searching  peace” she said “and if i don’t go  dress i shall have none this evening” “let me get you some orchids duchess” cried dorian starting  his feet  walking down  conservatory “you  flirting disgracefully  him” said lord henry  his cousin “you had better take care he  very fascinating” “if   not there would  no battle” “greek meets greek then” “i am   side   trojans they fought   woman” “they  defeated” “there  worse things than capture” she answered “you gallop   loose rein” “pace gives life”   riposte “i shall

him i have not yet told him  colour  my frock” “ah you must suit your frock  his flowers gladys” “that would   premature surrender” “romantic art begins   climax” “i must keep  opportunity  retreat” “in  parthian manner” “they found safety   desert i could not do that” “women  not always allowed  choice”  answered but hardly had  finished  sentence before   far end   conservatory came  stifled groan followed   dull sound   heavy fall everybody started up the duchess stood motionless  horror and  fear  his eyes lord henry rushed through  flapping palms  find dorian gray lying face downwards   tiled floor   deathlike swoon he  carried  once into  blue drawingroom  laid upon one   sofas after  short time  came  himself  looked round   dazed expression “what  happened”  asked “oh i remember am i safe here harry” he began  tremble “my dear dorian” answered lord henry “you merely fainted that  all you must have overtired yourself you had better not come down  dinner i  take your place” “no i  come down”  said struggling  his feet “i would rather come down i must not  alone” he went  his room  dressed there   wild recklessness  gaiety  his manner   sat  table but now  then  thrill  terror ran through him when  remembered that pressed against  window   conservatory like  white handkerchief  had seen  face  james vane watching him chapter xviii the next day  did not leave  house and indeed spent most   time  his own room sick   wild terror  dying  yet indifferent  life itself the consciousness  being hunted snared tracked down had begun  dominate him if  tapestry did but tremble   wind  shook the dead leaves   blown against  leaded panes seemed  him like his own wasted resolutions  wild regrets when  closed his eyes  saw again  sailor’s face peering through

chaos but there  something terribly logical   imagination it   imagination  set remorse  dog  feet  sin it   imagination  made each crime bear  misshapen brood in  common world  fact  wicked  not punished nor  good rewarded success  given   strong failure thrust upon  weak that  all besides had any stranger been prowling round  house  would have been seen   servants or  keepers had any

friend how ghastly  mere memory   scene he saw  all again each hideous detail came back  him  added horror out   black cave  time terrible  swathed  scarlet rose  image  his sin when lord henry came   six o’clock  found him crying  one whose heart  break it  not till  third day   ventured  go out there  something   clear pinescented air   winter morning  seemed  bring him back his joyousness  his ardour  life but   not merely  physical conditions  environment  had caused  change his own nature had revolted against  excess  anguish  had sought  maim  mar  perfection   calm with subtle  finely wrought temperaments   always so their strong passions must either bruise or bend they either slay  man or themselves die shallow sorrows  shallow loves live on the loves  sorrows   great  destroyed  their own plenitude besides  had convinced himself   had been  victim   terrorstricken imagination  looked back now  his fears  something  pity  not  little  contempt after breakfast  walked   duchess   hour   garden  then drove across  park  join  shootingparty the crisp frost lay like salt upon  grass the sky   inverted cup  blue metal a thin film  ice bordered  flat reedgrown lake at  corner   pinewood  caught sight  sir geoffrey clouston  duchess’s brother jerking two spent cartridges out  his gun he jumped   cart  having told  groom  take  mare home made his way towards his guest through  withered bracken  rough undergrowth “have you had good sport geoffrey”  asked “not very good dorian i think most   birds have gone   open i dare say    better after lunch when we get  new ground” dorian strolled along  his side the keen aromatic air  brown  red lights  glimmered   wood  hoarse cries   beaters ringing out  time  time   sharp snaps   guns  followed fascinated him  filled him   sense  delightful freedom he  dominated   carelessness  happiness   high indifference  joy suddenly   lumpy tussock  old grass some twenty yards  front  them  blacktipped ears erect  long hinder limbs throwing  forward started  hare it bolted   thicket  alders sir geoffrey put his gun  his shoulder but there  something   animal’s grace  movement  strangely charmed dorian gray   cried out  once “don’t shoot it geoffrey let  live” “what nonsense dorian” laughed his companion    hare bounded into  thicket  fired there  two cries heard  cry   hare  pain which  dreadful  cry   man  agony which  worse “good heavens i have hit  beater” exclaimed sir geoffrey “what  ass  man   get  front   guns stop shooting there”  called out   top  his voice “a man  hurt” the headkeeper came running up   stick  his hand “where sir where  he”  shouted at  same time  firing ceased along  line “here” answered sir geoffrey angrily hurrying towards  thicket “why  earth don’t you keep your men back spoiled my shooting   day” dorian watched them  they plunged into  alderclump brushing  lithe swinging branches aside in  few moments they emerged dragging  body after them into  sunlight he turned away  horror it seemed  him  misfortune followed wherever  went he heard sir geoffrey ask if  man  really dead   affirmative answer   keeper the wood seemed  him  have become suddenly alive  faces there   trampling  myriad feet   low buzz  voices a great copperbreasted pheasant came beating through  boughs overhead after  few moments—that   him  his perturbed state like endless hours  pain—he felt  hand laid  his shoulder he started  looked round “dorian” said lord henry “i had better tell them   shooting  stopped  today it would not look well  go on” “i wish   stopped  ever harry”  answered bitterly “the whole thing  hideous  cruel is  man ” he could not finish  sentence “i am afraid so” rejoined lord henry “he got  whole charge  shot  his chest he must have died almost instantaneously come let us go home” they walked side  side   direction   avenue  nearly fifty yards without speaking then dorian looked  lord henry  said   heavy sigh “it   bad omen harry  very bad omen” “what is” asked lord henry “oh this accident i suppose my dear fellow  can’t  helped it   man’s own fault why did  get  front   guns besides   nothing  us it  rather awkward  geoffrey  course it does not do  pepper beaters it makes people think  one   wild shot and geoffrey  not  shoots very straight but there  no use talking about  matter” dorian shook his head “it   bad omen harry i feel  if something horrible  going  happen  some  us to myself perhaps”  added passing his hand over his eyes   gesture  pain the elder man laughed “the only horrible thing   world  ennui dorian that   one sin  which there  no forgiveness but we  not likely  suffer   unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing  dinner i must tell them   subject    tabooed as  omens there  no such thing   omen destiny does not send us heralds she  too wise or too cruel  that besides what  earth could happen  you dorian you have everything   world   man can want there  no one who would not  delighted  change places  you” “there  no one  whom i would not change places harry don’t laugh like that i am telling you  truth the wretched peasant who  just died  better off than i am i have no terror  death it   coming  death  terrifies me its monstrous wings seem  wheel   leaden air around me good heavens don’t you see  man moving behind  trees there watching me waiting  me” lord henry looked   direction  which  trembling gloved hand  pointing “yes”  said smiling “i see  gardener waiting  you i suppose  wants  ask you what flowers you wish  have   table tonight how absurdly nervous you are my dear fellow you must come  see my doctor when we get back  town” dorian heaved  sigh  relief   saw  gardener approaching the man touched his hat glanced   moment  lord henry   hesitating manner  then produced  letter which  handed  his master “her grace told me  wait   answer”  murmured dorian put  letter into his pocket “tell her grace  i am coming in”  said coldly the man turned round  went rapidly   direction   house “how fond women   doing dangerous things” laughed lord henry “it  one   qualities  them  i admire most a woman  flirt  anybody   world  long  other people  looking on” “how fond you   saying dangerous things harry in  present instance you  quite astray i like  duchess very much but i don’t love her” “and  duchess loves you very much but she likes you less so you  excellently matched” “you  talking scandal harry  there  never any basis  scandal” “the basis  every scandal   immoral certainty” said lord henry lighting  cigarette “you would sacrifice anybody harry   sake   epigram” “the world goes   altar   own accord”   answer “i wish i could love” cried dorian gray   deep note  pathos  his voice “but i seem  have lost  passion  forgotten  desire i am too much concentrated  myself my own personality  become  burden  me i want  escape  go away  forget it  silly  me  come down here  all i think i shall send  wire  harvey  have  yacht got ready on  yacht one  safe” “safe  what dorian you   some trouble why not tell me what  is you know i would help you” “i can’t tell you harry”  answered sadly “and i dare say   only  fancy  mine this unfortunate accident  upset me i have  horrible presentiment  something   kind may happen  me” “what nonsense” “i hope  is but i can’t help feeling it ah here   duchess looking like artemis   tailormade gown you see we have come back duchess” “i have heard all about it mr gray” she answered “poor geoffrey  terribly upset and  seems  you asked him not  shoot  hare how curious” “yes   very curious i don’t know what made me say it some whim i suppose it looked  loveliest  little live things but i am sorry they told you about  man it   hideous subject” “it   annoying subject” broke  lord henry “it  no psychological value  all now if geoffrey had done  thing  purpose how interesting  would be i should like  know some one who had committed  real murder” “how horrid  you harry” cried  duchess “isn’t it mr gray harry mr gray  ill again he  going  faint” dorian drew himself up   effort  smiled “it  nothing duchess”  murmured “my nerves  dreadfully out  order that  all i am afraid i walked too far this morning i didn’t hear what harry said was  very bad you must tell me some other time i think i must go  lie down you  excuse me won’t you” they had reached  great flight  steps  led   conservatory    terrace as  glass door closed behind dorian lord henry turned  looked   duchess  his slumberous eyes “are you very much  love  him”  asked she did not answer  some time but stood gazing   landscape “i wish i knew” she said  last he shook his head “knowledge would  fatal it   uncertainty  charms one a mist makes things wonderful” “one may lose one’s way” “all ways end   same point my dear gladys” “what  that” “disillusion” “it  my début  life” she sighed “it came  you crowned” “i am tired  strawberry leaves” “they become you” “only  public” “you would miss them” said lord henry “i  not part   petal” “monmouth  ears” “old age  dull  hearing” “has  never been jealous” “i wish  had been” he glanced about  if  search  something “what  you looking for” she inquired “the button  your foil”  answered “you have dropped it” she laughed “i have still  mask” “it makes your eyes lovelier”  his reply she laughed again her teeth showed like white seeds   scarlet fruit upstairs  his own room dorian gray  lying   sofa  terror  every tingling fibre  his body life had suddenly become too hideous  burden  him  bear the dreadful death   unlucky beater shot   thicket like  wild animal had seemed  him  prefigure death  himself also he had nearly swooned  what lord henry had said   chance mood  cynical jesting at five o’clock  rang his bell  his servant  gave him orders  pack his things   nightexpress  town   have  brougham   door  eightthirty he  determined not  sleep another night  selby royal it   illomened place death walked there   sunlight the grass   forest had been spotted  blood then  wrote  note  lord henry telling him    going up  town  consult his doctor  asking him  entertain his guests  his absence as   putting  into  envelope  knock came   door  his valet informed him   headkeeper wished  see him he frowned  bit his lip “send him in”  muttered after some moments’ hesitation as soon   man entered dorian pulled his chequebook out   drawer  spread  out before him “i suppose you have come about  unfortunate accident  this morning thornton”  said taking up  pen “yes sir” answered  gamekeeper “was  poor fellow married had  any people dependent  him” asked dorian looking bored “if so i should not like them   left  want   send them any sum  money you may think necessary” “we don’t know who  is sir that  what i took  liberty  coming  you about” “don’t know who  is” said dorian listlessly “what do you mean wasn’t  one  your men” “no sir never saw him before seems like  sailor sir” the pen dropped  dorian gray’s hand   felt  if his heart had suddenly stopped beating “a sailor”  cried out “did you say  sailor” “yes sir he looks  if  had been  sort  sailor tattooed  both arms   kind  thing” “was there anything found  him” said dorian leaning forward  looking   man  startled eyes “anything  would tell his name” “some money sir—not much   sixshooter there  no name  any kind a decentlooking man sir but roughlike a sort  sailor we think” dorian started  his feet a terrible hope fluttered past him he clutched   madly “where   body”  exclaimed “quick i must see   once” “it    empty stable   home farm sir the folk don’t like  have  sort  thing  their houses they say  corpse brings bad luck” “the home farm go there  once  meet me tell one   grooms  bring my horse round no never mind i’ll go   stables myself it  save time” in less than  quarter   hour dorian gray  galloping down  long avenue  hard   could go the trees seemed  sweep past him  spectral procession  wild shadows  fling themselves across his path once  mare swerved   white gatepost  nearly threw him he lashed her across  neck  his crop she cleft  dusky air like  arrow the stones flew  her hoofs at last  reached  home farm two men  loitering   yard he leaped   saddle  threw  reins  one  them in  farthest stable  light  glimmering something seemed  tell him   body  there   hurried   door  put his hand upon  latch there  paused   moment feeling      brink   discovery  would either make or mar his life then  thrust  door open  entered on  heap  sacking   far corner  lying  dead body   man dressed   coarse shirt   pair  blue trousers a spotted handkerchief had been placed over  face a coarse candle stuck   bottle sputtered beside it dorian gray shuddered he felt  his could not   hand  take  handkerchief away  called out  one   farmservants  come  him “take  thing off  face i wish  see it”  said clutching   doorpost  support when  farmservant had done so  stepped forward a cry  joy broke  his lips the man who had been shot   thicket  james vane he stood there  some minutes looking   dead body as  rode home his eyes  full  tears   knew   safe chapter xix “there  no use your telling me  you  going   good” cried lord henry dipping his white fingers into  red copper bowl filled  rosewater “you  quite perfect pray don’t change” dorian gray shook his head “no harry i have done too many dreadful things  my life i am not going  do any more i began my good actions yesterday” “where  you yesterday” “in  country harry i  staying   little inn  myself” “my dear boy” said lord henry smiling “anybody can  good   country there  no temptations there that   reason why people who live out  town  so absolutely uncivilized civilization  not  any means  easy thing  attain to there  only two ways  which man can reach it one   being cultured  other  being corrupt country people have no opportunity  being either so they stagnate” “culture  corruption” echoed dorian “i have known something  both it seems terrible  me now  they should ever  found together for i have  new ideal harry i am going  alter i think i have altered” “you have not yet told me what your good action was or did you say you had done more than one” asked his companion   spilled into his plate  little crimson pyramid  seeded strawberries and through  perforated shellshaped spoon snowed white sugar upon them “i can tell you harry it  not  story i could tell  any one else i spared somebody it sounds vain but you understand what i mean she  quite beautiful  wonderfully like sibyl vane i think    which first attracted me  her you remember sibyl don’t you how long ago  seems well hetty  not one  our own class  course she  simply  girl   village but i really loved her i am quite sure  i loved her all during this wonderful may  we have been having i used  run down  see her two or three times  week yesterday she met me   little orchard the appleblossoms kept tumbling down  her hair  she  laughing we   have gone away together this morning  dawn suddenly i determined  leave her  flowerlike  i had found her” “i should think  novelty   emotion must have given you  thrill  real pleasure dorian” interrupted lord henry “but i can finish your idyll  you you gave her good advice  broke her heart that   beginning  your reformation” “harry you  horrible you mustn’t say these dreadful things hetty’s heart  not broken of course she cried  all that but there  no disgrace upon her she can live like perdita  her garden  mint  marigold” “and weep over  faithless florizel” said lord henry laughing   leaned back  his chair “my dear dorian you have  most curiously boyish moods do you think this girl  ever  really content now  any one  her own rank i suppose she   married some day   rough carter or  grinning ploughman well  fact  having met you  loved you  teach her  despise her husband  she   wretched from  moral point  view i cannot say  i think much  your great renunciation even   beginning   poor besides how do you know  hetty isn’t floating   present moment  some starlit millpond  lovely waterlilies round her like ophelia” “i can’t bear this harry you mock  everything  then suggest  most serious tragedies i am sorry i told you now i don’t care what you say  me i know i  right  acting  i did poor hetty as i rode past  farm this morning i saw her white face   window like  spray  jasmine don’t let us talk about  any more  don’t try  persuade me   first good action i have done  years  first little bit  selfsacrifice i have ever known  really  sort  sin i want   better i am going   better tell me something about yourself what  going   town i have not been   club  days” “the people  still discussing poor basil’s disappearance” “i should have thought they had got tired    this time” said dorian pouring himself out some wine  frowning slightly “my dear boy they have only been talking about   six weeks   british public  really not equal   mental strain  having more than one topic every three months they have been very fortunate lately however they have had my own divorcecase  alan campbell’s suicide now they have got  mysterious disappearance   artist scotland yard still insists   man   grey ulster who left  paris   midnight train   ninth  november  poor basil   french police declare  basil never arrived  paris  all i suppose  about  fortnight we shall  told    been seen  san francisco it   odd thing but every one who disappears  said   seen  san francisco it must   delightful city  possess all  attractions   next world” “what do you think  happened  basil” asked dorian holding up his burgundy against  light  wondering how     could discuss  matter so calmly “i have not  slightest idea if basil chooses  hide himself   no business  mine if   dead i don’t want  think about him death   only thing  ever terrifies me i hate it” “why” said  younger man wearily “because” said lord henry passing beneath his nostrils  gilt trellis   open vinaigrette box “one can survive everything nowadays except that death  vulgarity   only two facts   nineteenth century  one cannot explain away let us have our coffee   musicroom dorian you must play chopin  me the man  whom my wife ran away played chopin exquisitely poor victoria i  very fond  her the house  rather lonely without her of course married life  merely  habit  bad habit but then one regrets  loss even  one’s worst habits perhaps one regrets them  most they  such  essential part  one’s personality” dorian said nothing but rose   table  passing into  next room sat down   piano  let his fingers stray across  white  black ivory   keys after  coffee had been brought in  stopped  looking over  lord henry said “harry did  ever occur  you  basil  murdered” lord henry yawned “basil  very popular  always wore  waterbury watch why should  have been murdered he  not clever enough  have enemies of course  had  wonderful genius  painting but  man can paint like velasquez  yet   dull  possible basil  really rather dull he only interested me once    when  told me years ago   had  wild adoration  you   you   dominant motive  his art” “i  very fond  basil” said dorian   note  sadness  his voice “but don’t people say    murdered” “oh some   papers do it does not seem  me    all probable i know there  dreadful places  paris but basil  not  sort  man  have gone  them he had no curiosity it  his chief defect” “what would you say harry if i told you  i had murdered basil” said  younger man he watched him intently after  had spoken “i would say my dear fellow  you  posing   character  doesn’t suit you all crime  vulgar just  all vulgarity  crime it  not  you dorian  commit  murder i am sorry if i hurt your vanity  saying so but i assure you   true crime belongs exclusively   lower orders i don’t blame them   smallest degree i should fancy  crime   them what art   us simply  method  procuring extraordinary sensations” “a method  procuring sensations do you think then   man who  once committed  murder could possibly do  same crime again don’t tell me that” “oh anything becomes  pleasure if one does  too often” cried lord henry laughing “that  one   most important secrets  life i should fancy however  murder  always  mistake one should never do anything  one cannot talk about after dinner but let us pass  poor basil i wish i could believe   had come  such  really romantic end  you suggest but i can’t i dare say  fell into  seine off  omnibus    conductor hushed up  scandal yes i should fancy   his end i see him lying now  his back under those dullgreen waters   heavy barges floating over him  long weeds catching  his hair do you know i don’t think  would have done much more good work during  last ten years his painting had gone off very much” dorian heaved  sigh  lord henry strolled across  room  began  stroke  head   curious java parrot  large greyplumaged bird  pink crest  tail   balancing itself upon  bamboo perch as his pointed fingers touched it  dropped  white scurf  crinkled lids over black glasslike eyes  began  sway backwards  forwards “yes”  continued turning round  taking his handkerchief out  his pocket “his painting had quite gone off it seemed  me  have lost something it had lost  ideal when you   ceased   great friends  ceased    great artist what   separated you i suppose  bored you if so  never forgave you it’s  habit bores have by  way what  become   wonderful portrait  did  you i don’t think i have ever seen  since  finished it oh i remember your telling me years ago  you had sent  down  selby    had got mislaid or stolen   way you never got  back what  pity   really  masterpiece i remember i wanted  buy it i wish i had now it belonged  basil’s best period since then his work   curious mixture  bad painting  good intentions  always entitles  man   called  representative british artist did you advertise  it you should” “i forget” said dorian “i suppose i did but i never really liked it i am sorry i sat  it the memory   thing  hateful  me why do you talk  it it used  remind me  those curious lines  some play—hamlet i think—how do they run— “like  painting   sorrow a face without  heart” yes   what   like” lord henry laughed “if  man treats life artistically his brain  his heart”  answered sinking into  armchair dorian gray shook his head  struck some soft chords   piano “‘like  painting   sorrow’”  repeated “‘a face without  heart’” the elder man lay back  looked  him  halfclosed eyes “by  way dorian”  said after  pause “‘what does  profit  man if  gain  whole world  lose—how does  quotation run—his own soul’” the music jarred  dorian gray started  stared  his friend “why do you ask me that harry” “my dear fellow” said lord henry elevating his eyebrows  surprise “i asked you because i thought you might  able  give me  answer that  all i  going through  park last sunday  close   marble arch there stood  little crowd  shabbylooking people listening  some vulgar streetpreacher as i passed by i heard

“certainly the park  quite lovely now i don’t think there have been such lilacs since  year i met you” “very well i shall  here  eleven” said dorian “good night harry” as  reached  door  hesitated   moment  if  had something more  say then  sighed  went out chapter xx it   lovely night so warm   threw his coat over his arm  did not even put his silk scarf round his throat as  strolled home smoking his cigarette two young men  evening dress passed him he heard one  them whisper   other “that  dorian gray” he remembered how pleased  used   when   pointed out or stared at or talked about he  tired  hearing his own name now half  charm   little village where  had been so often lately   no one knew who  was he had often told  girl whom  had lured  love him    poor  she had believed him he had told her once    wicked  she had laughed  him  answered  wicked people  always very old  very ugly what  laugh she had—just like  thrush singing and how pretty she had been  her cotton dresses  her large hats she knew nothing but she had everything   had lost when  reached home  found his servant waiting up  him he sent him  bed  threw himself down   sofa   library  began  think over some   things  lord henry had said  him was  really true  one could never change he felt  wild longing   unstained purity  his boyhood—his rosewhite boyhood  lord henry had once called it he knew   had tarnished himself filled his mind  corruption  given horror  his fancy   had been  evil influence  others  had experienced  terrible joy  being so     lives  had crossed his own  had been  fairest   most full  promise   had brought  shame but   all irretrievable was there no hope  him ah  what  monstrous moment  pride  passion  had prayed   portrait should bear  burden  his days   keep  unsullied splendour  eternal youth all his failure had been due  that better  him  each sin  his life had brought  sure swift penalty along  it there  purification  punishment not “forgive us our sins” but “smite us  our iniquities” should   prayer  man   most just god the curiously carved mirror  lord henry had given  him so many years ago now  standing   table   whitelimbed cupids laughed round    old he took  up   had done   night  horror when  had first noted  change   fatal picture   wild teardimmed eyes looked into  polished shield once some one who had terribly loved him had written  him  mad letter ending  these idolatrous words “the world  changed because you  made  ivory  gold the curves  your lips rewrite history” the phrases came back  his memory   repeated them over  over  himself then  loathed his own beauty  flinging  mirror   floor crushed  into silver splinters beneath his heel it  his beauty  had ruined him his beauty   youth   had prayed for but  those two things his life might have been free  stain his beauty had been  him but  mask his youth but  mockery what  youth  best a green  unripe time  time  shallow moods  sickly thoughts why had  worn  livery youth had spoiled him it  better not  think   past nothing could alter that it   himself   his own future   had  think james vane  hidden   nameless grave  selby churchyard alan campbell had shot himself one night  his laboratory but had not revealed  secret   had been forced  know the excitement such   was over basil hallward’s disappearance would soon pass away it  already waning he  perfectly safe there nor indeed    death  basil hallward  weighed most upon his mind it   living death  his own soul  troubled him basil had painted  portrait  had marred his life he could not forgive him that it   portrait  had done everything basil had said things  him   unbearable    had yet borne  patience the murder had been simply  madness   moment as  alan campbell his suicide had been his own act he had chosen  do it it  nothing  him a new life that  what  wanted that  what   waiting for surely  had begun  already he had spared one innocent thing  any rate he would never again tempt innocence he would  good as  thought  hetty merton  began  wonder if  portrait   locked room had changed surely   not still so horrible   had been perhaps if his life became pure  would  able  expel every sign  evil passion   face perhaps  signs  evil had already gone away he would go  look he took  lamp   table  crept upstairs as  unbarred  door  smile  joy flitted across his strangely younglooking face  lingered   moment about his lips yes  would  good   hideous thing   had hidden away would no longer   terror  him he felt  if  load had been lifted  him already he went  quietly locking  door behind him   his custom  dragged  purple hanging   portrait a cry  pain  indignation broke  him he could see no change save    eyes there   look  cunning    mouth  curved wrinkle   hypocrite the thing  still loathsome—more loathsome if possible than before—and  scarlet dew  spotted  hand seemed brighter  more like blood newly spilled then  trembled had  been merely vanity  had made him do his one good deed or  desire   new sensation  lord henry had hinted  his mocking laugh or  passion  act  part  sometimes makes us do things finer than we  ourselves or perhaps all these and why   red stain larger than  had been it seemed  have crept like  horrible disease over  wrinkled fingers there  blood   painted feet  though  thing had dripped—blood even   hand  had not held  knife confess did  mean     confess to give himself up   put  death he laughed he felt   idea  monstrous besides even if  did confess who would believe him there  no trace   murdered man anywhere everything belonging  him had been destroyed he himself had burned what had been belowstairs the world would simply say    mad they would shut him up if  persisted  his story yet   his duty  confess  suffer public shame   make public atonement there   god who called upon men  tell their sins  earth  well   heaven nothing   could do would cleanse him till  had told his own sin his sin he shrugged his shoulders the death  basil hallward seemed very little  him he  thinking  hetty merton for    unjust mirror this mirror  his soul    looking at vanity curiosity hypocrisy had there been nothing more  his renunciation than that there had been something more at least  thought so but who could tell  no there had been nothing more through vanity  had spared her in hypocrisy  had worn  mask  goodness for curiosity’s sake  had tried  denial  self he recognized  now but this murder—was   dog him all his life was  always   burdened  his past was  really  confess never there  only one bit  evidence left against him the picture itself—that  evidence he would destroy it why had  kept  so long once  had given him pleasure  watch  changing  growing old of late  had felt no such pleasure it had kept him awake  night when  had been away  had been filled  terror lest other eyes should look upon it it had brought melancholy across his passions its mere memory had marred many moments  joy it had been like conscience  him yes  had been conscience he would destroy it he looked round  saw  knife  had stabbed basil hallward he had cleaned  many times till there  no stain left upon it it  bright  glistened as  had killed  painter so  would kill  painter’s work  all   meant it would kill  past  when   dead  would  free it would kill this monstrous soullife  without  hideous warnings  would   peace he seized  thing  stabbed  picture  it there   cry heard   crash the cry  so horrible   agony   frightened servants woke  crept out  their rooms two gentlemen who  passing   square below stopped  looked up   great
