picking apples   green gables orchard but  now resting  their labors   sunny corner where airy fleets  thistledown drifted    wings   wind   still summersweet   incense  ferns   haunted wood but everything   landscape around them spoke  autumn the sea  roaring hollowly   distance  fields  bare  sere scarfed  golden rod  brook valley below green gables overflowed  asters  ethereal purple   lake  shining waters  blueblueblue not  changeful blue  spring nor  pale azure  summer but  clear steadfast serene blue  if  water  past all moods  tenses  emotion  had settled down   tranquility unbroken  fickle dreams “it  been  nice summer” said diana twisting  new ring  her left hand   smile “and miss lavendar’s wedding seemed  come   sort  crown  it i suppose mr  mrs irving    pacific coast now” “it seems  me they have been gone long enough  go around  world” sighed anne “i can’t believe   only  week since they  married everything  changed miss lavendar  mr  mrs allan gonehow lonely  manse looks   shutters all closed i went past  last night   made me feel  if everybody   had died” “we’ll never get another minister  nice  mr allan” said diana  gloomy conviction “i suppose we’ll have all kinds  supplies this winter  half  sundays no preaching  all and you  gilbert goneit   awfully dull” “fred   here” insinuated anne slyly “when  mrs lynde going  move up” asked diana  if she had not heard anne’s remark “tomorrow i’m glad she’s comingbut    another change marilla  i cleared everything out   spare room yesterday do you know i hated  do it of course   sillybut  did seem  if we  committing sacrilege that old spare room  always seemed like  shrine  me when i   child i thought   most wonderful apartment   world you remember what  consuming desire i had  sleep   spare

tiptoed through   held my breath  if i   church  felt relieved when i got out  it the pictures  george whitefield   duke  wellington hung there one  each side   mirror  frowned so sternly  me all  time i  in especially if i dared peep   mirror which   only one   house  didn’t twist my face  little i always wondered how marilla dared houseclean  room and now it’s not only cleaned but stripped bare george whitefield   duke have been relegated   upstairs hall ‘so passes  glory  this world’” concluded anne   laugh  which there   little note  regret it  never pleasant  have our old shrines desecrated even when we have outgrown them “i’ll  so lonesome when you go” moaned diana   hundredth time “and  think you go next week” “but we’re together still” said anne cheerily “we mustn’t let next week rob us  this week’s joy i hate  thought  going myselfhome  i  such good friends talk  being lonesome it’s i who should groan you’ll  here  any number  your old friendsand fred while i shall  alone among strangers not knowing  soul” “except gilbertand charlie sloane” said diana imitating anne’s italics  slyness “charlie sloane    great comfort  course” agreed anne sarcastically whereupon both those irresponsible damsels laughed diana knew exactly what anne thought  charlie sloane but despite sundry confidential talks she did not know just what anne thought  gilbert blythe to  sure anne herself did not know that “the boys may  boarding   other end  kingsport  all i know” anne went on “i am glad i’m going  redmond  i am sure i shall like  after  while but   first few weeks i know i won’t i shan’t even have  comfort  looking forward   weekend visit home  i had when i went  queen’s christmas  seem like  thousand years away” “everything  changingor going  change” said diana sadly “i have  feeling  things  never   same again anne” “we have come   parting   ways i suppose” said anne thoughtfully “we had  come  it do you think diana  being grownup  really  nice  we used  imagine  would  when we  children” “i don’t knowthere  some nice things about it” answered diana again caressing her ring   little smile which always had  effect  making anne feel suddenly left out  inexperienced “but there  so many puzzling things too sometimes i feel  if being grownup just frightened meand then i would give anything    little girl again” “i suppose we’ll get used  being grownup  time” said anne cheerfully “there won’t  so many unexpected things about    bythough after all i fancy it’s  unexpected things  give spice  life we’re eighteen diana in two more years we’ll  twenty when i  ten i thought twenty   green old age in no time you’ll   staid middleaged matron  i shall  nice old maid aunt anne coming  visit you  vacations you’ll always keep  corner  me won’t you di

laughed diana “you’ll marry somebody splendid  handsome  richand no spare room  avonlea   half gorgeous enough  youand you’ll turn up your nose  all  friends  your youth” “that would   pity my nose  quite nice but i fear turning  up would spoil it” said anne patting  shapely organ “i haven’t so many good features  i could afford  spoil those i have so even if i should marry  king   cannibal islands i promise you i won’t turn up my nose  you diana” with another gay laugh  girls separated diana  return  orchard slope anne  walk   post office she found  letter awaiting her there  when gilbert blythe overtook her   bridge over  lake  shining waters she  sparkling   excitement  it “priscilla grant  going  redmond too” she exclaimed “isn’t  splendid i hoped she would but she didn’t think her father would consent he has however  we’re  board together i feel  i can face  army  bannersor all  professors  redmond  one fell phalanxwith  chum like priscilla  my side” “i think we’ll like kingsport” said gilbert “it’s  nice old burg they tell me    finest natural park   world i’ve heard   scenery    magnificent” “i wonder if   becan beany more beautiful than this” murmured anne looking around her   loving enraptured eyes  those  whom “home” must always   loveliest spot   world no matter what fairer lands may lie under alien stars they  leaning   bridge   old pond drinking deep   enchantment   dusk just   spot where anne had climbed  her sinking dory   day elaine floated down  camelot the fine empurpling dye  sunset still stained  western skies but  moon  rising   water lay like  great silver dream  her light remembrance wove  sweet  subtle spell over  two young creatures “you  very quiet anne” said gilbert  last “i’m afraid  speak or move  fear all this wonderful beauty  vanish just like  broken silence” breathed anne gilbert suddenly laid his hand over  slender white one lying   rail   bridge his hazel eyes deepened into darkness his still boyish lips opened  say something   dream  hope  thrilled his soul but anne snatched her hand away  turned quickly the spell   dusk  broken  her “i must go home” she exclaimed   rather overdone carelessness “marilla had  headache this afternoon  i’m sure  twins    some dreadful mischief  this time i really shouldn’t have stayed away so long” she chattered ceaselessly  inconsequently until they reached  green gables lane poor gilbert hardly had  chance  get  word  edgewise anne felt rather relieved when they parted there had been  new secret selfconsciousness  her heart  regard  gilbert ever since  fleeting moment  revelation   garden  echo lodge something alien had intruded into  old perfect schoolday comradeshipsomething  threatened  mar it “i never felt glad  see gilbert go before” she thought halfresentfully halfsorrowfully  she walked alone up  lane “our friendship   spoiled if  goes   this nonsense it mustn’t  spoiledi won’t let it oh why can’t boys  just sensible” anne had  uneasy doubt    not strictly “sensible”  she should still feel  her hand  warm pressure  gilbert’s  distinctly  she had felt    swift second his had rested there  still less sensible   sensation  far  being  unpleasant onevery different   which had attended  similar demonstration  charlie sloane’s part when she had been sitting out  dance  him   white sands party three nights before anne shivered over  disagreeable recollection but all problems connected  infatuated swains vanished  her mind when she entered  homely unsentimental atmosphere   green gables kitchen where  eightyearold boy  crying grievously   sofa “what   matter davy” asked anne taking him up  her arms “where  marilla  dora” “marilla’s putting dora  bed” sobbed davy “and i’m crying ‘cause dora fell down  outside cellar steps heels over head  scraped all  skin off her nose and” “oh well don’t cry about it dear of course you  sorry  her but crying won’t help her any she’ll  all right tomorrow crying never helps any one davyboy and” “i ain’t crying ‘cause dora fell down cellar” said davy cutting short anne’s wellmeant preachment  increasing bitterness “i’m crying cause i wasn’t there  see her fall i’m always missing some fun or other seems  me” “oh davy” anne choked back  unholy shriek  laughter “would you call  fun  see poor little dora fall down  steps  get hurt” “she wasn’t much hurt” said davy defiantly “‘course if she’d been killed i’d have been real sorry anne but  keiths ain’t so easy killed they’re like  blewetts i guess herb blewett fell off  hayloft last wednesday  rolled right down through  turnip chute into  box stall where they had  fearful wild cross horse  rolled right under his heels and still  got out alive  only three bones broke mrs lynde says there  some folks you can’t kill   meataxe is mrs lynde coming here tomorrow anne” “yes davy  i hope you’ll  always very nice  good  her” “i’ll  nice  good but  she ever put me  bed  nights anne” “perhaps why” “‘cause” said davy very decidedly “if she does i won’t say my prayers before her like i do before you anne” “why not” “‘cause i don’t think  would  nice  talk  god before strangers anne dora can say hers  mrs lynde if she likes but i won’t i’ll wait till she’s gone  then say ‘em won’t   all right anne” “yes if you  sure you won’t forget  say them davyboy” “oh i won’t forget you bet i think saying my prayers  great fun but  won’t   good fun saying them alone  saying them  you i wish you’d stay home anne i don’t see what you want  go away  leave us for” “i don’t exactly want to davy but i feel i ought  go” “if you don’t want  go you needn’t you’re grown up when i‘m grown up i’m not going  do one single thing i don’t want  do anne” “all your life davy you’ll find yourself doing things you don’t want  do” “i won’t” said davy flatly “catch me i have  do things i don’t want  now ‘cause you  marilla’ll send me  bed if i don’t but when i grow up you can’t do that  there’ll  nobody  tell me not  do things won’t i have  time say anne milty boulter says his mother says you’re going  college  see if you can catch  man are you anne i want  know” for  second anne burned  resentment then she laughed reminding herself  mrs boulter’s crude vulgarity  thought  speech could not harm her “no davy i’m not i’m going  study  grow  learn about many things” “what things” “‘shoes  ships  sealing wax and cabbages  kings’” quoted anne “but if you did want  catch  man how would you go about it i want  know” persisted davy  whom  subject evidently possessed  certain fascination “you’d better ask mrs boulter” said anne thoughtlessly “i think it’s likely she knows more about  process than i do” “i will  next time i see her” said davy gravely “davy if you do” cried anne realizing her mistake “but you just told me to” protested davy aggrieved “it’s time you went  bed” decreed anne  way  getting out   scrape after davy had gone  bed anne wandered down  victoria island  sat there alone curtained

becoming merely food  amusement now josie suspected  anne  laughing  her behind those wicked eyes but she contented herself  whispering  gertie  they went downstairs  anne shirley would put  more airs

found however  revenge hurts nobody quite so much   one who tries  inflict it gilbert walked airily off  ruby gillis  anne could hear them laughing  talking gaily  they loitered along   still crisp autumn air they  evidently having  best  good times while she  horribly bored  charlie sloane who talked unbrokenly on  never even  accident said one thing   worth listening to anne gave  occasional absent “yes” or “no”  thought how beautiful ruby had looked  night how very goggly charlie’s eyes    moonlightworse even than  daylightand   world somehow wasn’t quite such  nice place  she had believed    earlier   evening “i’m just tired outthat  what   matter  me” she said when she thankfully found herself alone  her own room and she honestly believed  was but  certain little gush  joy   some secret unknown spring bubbled up  her heart  next evening when she saw gilbert striding down through  haunted wood  crossing  old log bridge   firm quick step  his so gilbert  not going  spend this last evening  ruby gillis after all “you look tired anne”  said “i am tired and worse than that i’m disgruntled i’m tired because i’ve been packing my trunk  sewing all day but i’m disgruntled because six women have been here  say goodbye  me  every one   six managed  say something  seemed  take  color right out  life  leave   gray  dismal  cheerless   november morning” “spiteful old cats”  gilbert’s elegant comment “oh no they weren’t” said anne seriously “that  just  trouble if they had been spiteful cats i wouldn’t have minded them but they  all nice kind motherly souls who like me  whom i like    why what they said or hinted had such undue weight  me they let me see they thought i  crazy going  redmond  trying  take  ba  ever since i’ve been wondering if i am mrs peter sloane sighed  said she hoped my strength would hold out till i got through   once i saw myself  hopeless victim  nervous prostration   end  my third year mrs eben wright said  must cost  awful lot  put  four years  redmond  i felt all over me    unpardonable  me  squander marilla’s money  my own  such  folly mrs jasper bell said she hoped i wouldn’t let college spoil me   did some people  i felt  my bones   end  my four redmond years would see me  most insufferable creature thinking i knew  all  looking down  everything  everybody  avonlea mrs elisha wright said she understood  redmond girls especially those who belonged  kingsport  ‘dreadful dressy  stuckup’  she guessed i wouldn’t feel much  home among them  i saw myself  snubbed dowdy humiliated country girl shuffling through redmond’s classic halls  coppertoned boots” anne ended   laugh   sigh commingled with her sensitive nature all disapproval had weight even  disapproval  those  whose opinions she had scant respect for  time being life  savorless  ambition had gone out like  snuffed candle “you surely don’t care  what they said” protested gilbert “you know exactly how narrow their outlook  life is excellent creatures though they are to do anything they have never done  anathema maranatha you   first avonlea girl who  ever gone  college  you know  all pioneers  considered   afflicted  moonstruck madness” “oh i know but feeling  so different  knowing my common sense tells me all you can say but there  times when common sense  no power over me common nonsense takes possession  my soul really after mrs elisha went away i hardly had  heart  finish packing” “you’re just tired anne come forget  all  take  walk  mea ramble back through  woods beyond  marsh there should  something there i want  show you” “should be don’t you know if   there” “no i only know  should be  something i saw there  spring come on we’ll pretend we  two children again  we’ll go  way   wind” they started gaily off anne remembering  unpleasantness   preceding evening  very nice  gilbert  gilbert who  learning wisdom took care   nothing save  schoolboy comrade again mrs lynde  marilla watched them   kitchen window “that’ll   match some day” mrs lynde said approvingly marilla winced slightly in her heart she hoped  would but  went against her grain  hear  matter spoken   mrs lynde’s gossipy matteroffact way “they’re only children yet” she said shortly mrs lynde laughed goodnaturedly “anne  eighteen i  married when i   age we old folks marilla  too much given  thinking children never grow up that’s what anne   young woman  gilbert’s  man   worships  ground she walks on  any one can see he’s  fine fellow  anne can’t do better i hope she won’t get any romantic nonsense into her head  redmond i don’t approve  them coeducational places  never did that’s what i don’t believe” concluded mrs lynde solemnly “that  students  such colleges ever do much else than flirt” “they must study  little” said marilla   smile “precious little” sniffed mrs rachel “however i think anne will she never  flirtatious but she doesn’t appreciate gilbert  his full value that’s what oh i know girls charlie sloane  wild about her too but i’d never advise her  marry  sloane the sloanes  good honest respectable people  course but when all’s said  done they’re sloanes” marilla nodded to  outsider  statement  sloanes  sloanes might not  very illuminating but she understood every village  such  family good honest respectable people they may be but sloanes they   must ever remain though they speak   tongues  men  angels gilbert  anne happily unconscious  their future  thus being settled  mrs rachel  sauntering through  shadows   haunted wood beyond  harvest hills  basking   amber sunset radiance under  pale aerial sky  rose  blue the distant spruce groves  burnished bronze  their long shadows barred  upland meadows but around them  little wind sang among  fir tassels    there   note  autumn “this wood really  haunted nowby old memories” said anne stooping  gather  spray  ferns bleached  waxen whiteness  frost “it seems  me   little girls diana  i used   play here still  sit   dryad’s bubble   twilights trysting   ghosts do you know i can never go up this path   dusk without feeling  bit   old fright  shiver there  one especially horrifying phantom which we createdthe ghost   murdered child  crept up behind you  laid cold fingers  yours i confess that  this day i cannot help fancying  little furtive footsteps behind me when i come here after nightfall i’m not afraid   white lady or  headless man or  skeletons but i wish i had never imagined  baby’s ghost into existence how angry marilla  mrs barry  over  affair” concluded anne  reminiscent laughter the woods around  head   marsh  full  purple vistas threaded  gossamers past  dour plantation  gnarled spruces   maplefringed sunwarm valley they found  “something” gilbert  looking for “ah here  is”  said  satisfaction “an apple treeand away back here” exclaimed anne delightedly “yes  veritable applebearing apple tree too here   very midst  pines  beeches  mile away  any orchard i  here one day last spring  found it all white  blossom so i resolved i’d come again   fall  see if  had been apples see it’s loaded they look good tootawny  russets but   dusky red cheek most wild seedlings  green  uninviting” “i suppose  sprang years ago  some chancesown seed” said anne dreamily “and how   grown  flourished  held  own here all alone among aliens  brave determined thing” “here’s  fallen tree   cushion  moss sit down anneit  serve   woodland throne i’ll climb  some apples they all grow highthe tree had  reach up   sunlight” the apples proved   delicious under  tawny skin   white white flesh faintly veined  red and besides their own proper apple taste they had  certain wild delightful tang no orchardgrown apple ever possessed “the fatal apple  eden couldn’t have had  rarer flavor” commented anne “but it’s time we  going home see   twilight three minutes ago  now it’s moonlight what  pity we couldn’t have caught  moment  transformation but such moments never  caught i suppose” “let’s go back around  marsh  home  way  lover’s lane do you feel  disgruntled now  when you started out anne” “not i those apples have been  manna   hungry soul i feel  i shall love redmond  have  splendid four years there” “and after those four yearswhat” “oh there’s another bend   road  their end” answered anne lightly “i’ve no idea what may  around iti don’t want  have it’s nicer not  know” lover’s lane   dear place  night still  mysteriously dim   pale radiance   moonlight they loitered through    pleasant chummy silence neither caring  talk “if gilbert  always    been this evening how nice  simple everything would be” reflected anne gilbert  looking  anne  she walked along in her light dress  her slender delicacy she made him think   white iris “i wonder if i can ever make her care  me”  thought   pang

concluded  anne’s going mattered very little  herunless said observer had happened  get  good look  her eyes dora kissed anne primly  squeezed out two decorous little tears but davy who had been crying   back porch step ever since they rose   table refused  say goodbye  all when  saw anne coming towards him  sprang  his feet bolted up  back stairs  hid   clothes closet out  which  would not

brought her no comfort  charlie sloane  there too  sloanishness could  tolerated only  fine weather it  absolutely insufferable  rain but when  boat steamed out  charlottetown harbor things took  turn   better the rain ceased   sun began  burst out goldenly now  again between  rents   clouds burnishing  gray seas  copperhued radiance  lighting up  mists  curtained  island’s red shores  gleams  gold foretokening  fine day after all besides charlie sloane promptly became so seasick   had  go below  anne  gilbert  left alone  deck “i am very glad  all  sloanes get seasick  soon  they go  water” thought anne mercilessly “i am sure i couldn’t take my farewell look   ‘ould sod’  charlie standing there pretending  look sentimentally  it too” “well we’re off” remarked gilbert unsentimentally “yes i feel like byron’s ‘childe harold’only  isn’t really my ‘native shore’  i’m watching” said anne winking her gray eyes vigorously “nova scotia  that i suppose but one’s native shore   land one loves  best  that’s good old pei  me i can’t believe i didn’t always live here those eleven years before i came seem like  bad dream it’s seven years since i crossed  this boatthe evening mrs spencer brought me over  hopetown i can see myself   dreadful old wincey dress  faded sailor hat exploring decks  cabins  enraptured curiosity it   fine evening  how those red island shores did gleam   sunshine now i’m crossing  strait again oh gilbert i do hope i’ll like redmond  kingsport but i’m sure i won’t” “where’s all your philosophy gone anne” “it’s all submerged under  great swamping wave  loneliness  homesickness i’ve longed  three years  go  redmondand now i’m goingand i wish i weren’t never mind i shall  cheerful  philosophical again after i have just one good cry i must have that ‘as  went’and i’ll have  wait until i get into my boardinghouse bed tonight wherever  may be before i can have it then anne   herself again i wonder if davy  come out   closet yet” it  nine  night when their train reached kingsport  they found themselves   bluewhite glare   crowded station anne felt horribly bewildered but  moment later she  seized  priscilla grant who had come  kingsport  saturday “here you are beloved and i suppose you’re  tired  i  when i got here saturday night” “tired priscilla don’t talk  it i’m tired  green  provincial  only about ten years old for pity’s sake take your poor brokendown chum  some place where she can hear herself think” “i’ll take you right up  our boardinghouse i’ve  cab ready outside” “it’s such  blessing you’re here prissy if you weren’t i think i should just sit down  my suitcase here  now  weep bitter tears what  comfort one familiar face    howling wilderness  strangers” “is  gilbert blythe over there anne how   grown up this past year he  only  schoolboy when i taught  carmody and  course that’s charlie sloane he hasn’t changedcouldn’t he looked just like  when   born  he’ll look like  when he’s eighty this way dear we’ll  home  twenty minutes” “home” groaned anne “you mean we’ll   some horrible boardinghouse   still more horrible hall bedroom looking out   dingy back yard” “it isn’t  horrible boardinghouse annegirl here’s our cab hop inthe driver  get your trunk oh yes  boardinghouseit’s really  very nice place   kind  you’ll admit tomorrow morning when  good night’s sleep  turned your blues rosy pink it’s  big oldfashioned gray stone house  st john street just  nice little constitutional  redmond it used    ‘residence’  great folk but fashion  deserted st john street   houses only dream now  better days they’re so big  people living  them have  take boarders just  fill up at least    reason our landladies  very anxious  impress  us they’re delicious anneour landladies i mean” “how many  there” “two miss hannah harvey  miss ada harvey they  born twins about fifty years ago” “i can’t get away  twins  seems” smiled anne “wherever i go they confront me” “oh they’re not twins now dear after they reached  age  thirty they never  twins again miss hannah  grown old not too gracefully  miss ada  stayed thirty less gracefully still i don’t know whether miss hannah can smile or not i’ve never caught her   so far but miss ada smiles all  time  that’s worse however they’re nice kind souls  they take two boarders every year because miss hannah’s economical soul cannot bear  ‘waste room space’not because they need  or have to  miss ada  told me seven times since saturday night as  our rooms i admit they  hall bedrooms  mine does look out   back yard your room   front one  looks out  old st john’s graveyard which  just across  street” “that sounds gruesome” shivered anne “i think i’d rather have  back yard view” “oh no you wouldn’t wait  see old st john’s   darling place it’s been  graveyard so long  it’s ceased   one   become one   sights  kingsport i  all through  yesterday   pleasure exertion there’s  big stone wall   row  enormous trees all around it  rows  trees all through it   queerest old tombstones   queerest  quaintest inscriptions you’ll go there  study anne see if you don’t of course nobody  ever buried there now but  few years ago they put up  beautiful monument   memory  nova scotian soldiers who fell   crimean war it  just opposite  entrance gates  there’s ‘scope  imagination’  it  you used  say here’s your trunk  lastand  boys coming  say good night must i really shake hands  charlie sloane anne his hands  always so cold  fishyfeeling we must ask them  call occasionally miss hannah gravely told me we could have ‘young gentlemen callers’ two evenings   week if they

there  cushions  everything miss ada even   elaborate battenburg one  top   piano” anne  laughing  this time priscilla’s gay chatter had  intended effect  cheering her up homesickness vanished   time being  did not even return  full force when she finally found herself alone  her little bedroom she went  her window  looked out the street below  dim  quiet across   moon  shining above  trees  old st john’s just behind  great dark head   lion   monument anne wondered if  could have been only  morning  she had left green gables she had  sense   long passage  time which one day  change  travel gives “i suppose  very moon  looking down  green gables now” she mused “but i won’t think about itthat way homesickness lies i’m not even going  have my good cry i’ll put  off   more convenient season  just now i’ll go calmly  sensibly  bed   sleep” chapter iv april’s lady kingsport   quaint old town hearking back  early colonial days  wrapped   ancient atmosphere  some fine old dame  garments

old st john’s  next afternoon she  priscilla had gone  redmond   forenoon  registered  students after which there  nothing more  do  day the girls gladly made their escape    not exhilarating   surrounded  crowds  strangers most  whom had  rather alien appearance  if not quite sure where they belonged the “freshettes” stood about  detached groups  two or three looking askance  each other  “freshies” wiser  their day  generation had banded themselves together   big staircase   entrance hall where they  shouting out glees  all  vigor  youthful lungs   species  defiance  their traditional enemies  sophomores  few  whom  prowling loftily about looking properly disdainful   “unlicked cubs”   stairs gilbert  charlie  nowhere   seen “little did i think  day would ever come when i’d  glad   sight   sloane” said priscilla  they crossed  campus “but i’d welcome charlie’s goggle eyes almost ecstatically at least they’d  familiar eyes” “oh” sighed anne “i can’t describe how i felt when i  standing there waiting my turn   registeredas insignificant   teeniest drop   most enormous bucket it’s bad enough  feel insignificant but it’s unbearable  have  grained into your soul  you  never can never  anything but insignificant    how i did feelas if i  invisible   naked eye  some  those sophs might step  me i knew i would go down  my grave unwept unhonored  unsung” “wait till next year” comforted priscilla “then we’ll  able  look  bored  sophisticated  any sophomore  them all no doubt   rather dreadful  feel insignificant but i think it’s better than  feel  big  awkward  i didas if i  sprawled all over redmond that’s how i felti suppose because i   good two inches taller than any one else   crowd i wasn’t afraid  soph might walk over me i  afraid they’d take me   elephant or  overgrown sample   potatofed islander” “i suppose  trouble  we can’t forgive big redmond  not being little queen’s” said anne gathering about her  shreds  her old cheerful philosophy  cover her nakedness  spirit “when we left queen’s we knew everybody  had  place  our own i suppose we have been unconsciously expecting  take life up  redmond just where we left off  queen’s  now we feel  if  ground had slipped  under our feet i’m thankful  neither mrs lynde nor mrs elisha wright know or ever  know my state  mind  present they would exult  saying ‘i told you so’   convinced    beginning   end whereas   just  end   beginning” “exactly that sounds more anneish in  little while we’ll  acclimated  acquainted  all   well anne did you notice  girl who stood alone just outside  door   coeds’ dressing room all  morningthe pretty one   brown eyes  crooked mouth” “yes i did i noticed her particularly because she seemed  only creature there who looked  lonely  friendless  i felt i had you but she had no one” “i think she felt pretty allbyherselfish too several times i saw her make  motion  if  cross over  us but she never did ittoo shy i suppose i wished she would come if i hadn’t felt so much like  aforesaid elephant i’d have gone  her but i couldn’t lumber across  big hall  all those boys howling   stairs she   prettiest freshette i saw today but probably favor  deceitful  even beauty  vain  your first day  redmond” concluded priscilla   laugh “i’m going across  old st john’s after lunch” said anne “i don’t know   graveyard   very good place  go  get cheered up but  seems  only getatable place where there  trees  trees i must have i’ll sit  one  those old slabs  shut my eyes  imagine i’m   avonlea woods” anne did not do that however  she found enough  interest  old st john’s  keep her eyes wide open they went    entrance gates past  simple massive stone arch surmounted   great lion  england “‘and  inkerman yet  wild bramble  gory and those bleak heights henceforth shall  famous  story’” quoted anne looking     thrill they found themselves   dim cool green place where winds  fond  purring up  down  long grassy aisles they wandered reading  quaint voluminous epitaphs carved   age  had more leisure than our own “‘here lieth  body  albert crawford esq’” read anne   worn gray slab “‘for many years keeper  his majesty’s ordnance  kingsport he served   army till  peace   when  retired  bad health he   brave officer  best  husbands  best  fathers  best  friends he died october th  aged  years’ there’s  epitaph  you prissy there  certainly some ‘scope  imagination’  it how full such  life must have been  adventure and   his personal qualities i’m sure human eulogy couldn’t go further i wonder if they told him   all those best things while   alive” “here’s another” said priscilla “listen ‘to  memory  alexander ross who died   nd  september  aged  years this  raised   tribute  affection  one whom  served so faithfully   years    regarded   friend deserving  fullest confidence  attachment’” “a very good epitaph” commented anne thoughtfully “i wouldn’t wish  better we  all servants  some sort  if  fact  we  faithful can  truthfully inscribed  our tombstones nothing more need  added here’s  sorrowful little gray stone prissy‘to  memory   favorite child’ and here  another ‘erected   memory  one who  buried elsewhere’ i wonder where  unknown grave is really pris  graveyards  today  never   interesting  this you  righti shall come here often i love  already i see we’re not alone herethere’s  girl down   end  this avenue” “yes  i believe it’s  very girl we saw  redmond this morning i’ve been watching her  five minutes she  started  come up  avenue exactly half  dozen times  half  dozen times  she turned  gone back either she’s dreadfully shy or she  got something  her conscience let’s go  meet her it’s easier  get acquainted   graveyard than  redmond i believe” they walked down  long grassy arcade towards  stranger who  sitting   gray slab under  enormous willow she  certainly very pretty   vivid irregular bewitching type  prettiness there   gloss   brown nuts  her satinsmooth hair   soft ripe glow  her round cheeks her eyes  big  brown  velvety under oddlypointed black brows  her crooked mouth  rosered she wore  smart brown suit  two very modish little shoes peeping  beneath it  her hat  dull pink straw wreathed  goldenbrown poppies had  indefinable unmistakable air which pertains   “creation”   artist  millinery priscilla had  sudden stinging consciousness  her own hat had been trimmed  her village store milliner  anne wondered uncomfortably if  blouse she had made herself  which mrs lynde had fitted looked very countrified  homemade besides  stranger’s smart attire for  moment both girls felt like turning back but they had already stopped  turned towards  gray slab it  too late  retreat   browneyed girl had evidently concluded  they  coming  speak  her instantly she sprang up  came forward  outstretched hand   gay friendly smile  which there seemed not  shadow  either shyness or burdened conscience “oh i want  know who you two girls are” she exclaimed eagerly “i’ve been dying  know i saw you  redmond this morning say wasn’t  awful there for  time i wished i had stayed home  got married” anne  priscilla both broke into unconstrained laughter  this unexpected conclusion the browneyed girl laughed too “i really did i could have you know come let’s all sit down  this gravestone  get acquainted it won’t  hard i know we’re going  adore each otheri knew   soon  i saw you  redmond this morning i wanted so much  go right over  hug you both” “why didn’t you” asked priscilla “because i simply couldn’t make up my mind  do it i never can make up my mind about anything myselfi’m always afflicted  indecision just  soon  i decide  do something i feel  my bones  another course would   correct one it’s  dreadful misfortune but i  born  way  there  no use  blaming me  it  some people do so i couldn’t make up my mind  go  speak  you much  i wanted to” “we thought you  too shy” said anne “no no dear shyness isn’t among  many failingsor virtuesof philippa gordonphil  short do call me phil right off now what  your handles” “she’s priscilla grant” said anne pointing “and she’s anne shirley” said priscilla pointing  turn “and we’re   island” said both together “i hail  bolingbroke nova scotia” said philippa “bolingbroke” exclaimed anne “why   where i  born” “do you really mean it why  makes you  bluenose after all” “no  doesn’t” retorted anne “wasn’t  dan o’connell who said  if  man  born   stable  didn’t make him  horse i’m island   core” “well i’m glad you  born  bolingbroke anyway it makes us kind  neighbors doesn’t it and i like that because when i tell you secrets  won’t   if i  telling them   stranger i have  tell them i can’t keep secretsit’s no use  try that’s my worst failingthat  indecision  aforesaid would you believe itit took me half  hour  decide which hat  wear when i  coming herehere   graveyard at first i inclined  my brown one   feather but  soon  i put   i thought this pink one   floppy brim would  more becoming when i got it pinned  place i liked  brown one better at last i put them close together   bed shut my eyes  jabbed   hat pin the pin speared  pink one so i put  on it  becoming isn’t it tell me what do you think  my looks” at this naive demand made   perfectly serious tone priscilla laughed again but anne said impulsively squeezing philippa’s hand “we thought this morning  you   prettiest girl we saw  redmond” philippa’s crooked mouth flashed into  bewitching crooked smile over very white little teeth “i thought  myself”  her next astounding statement “but i wanted some one else’s opinion  bolster mine up i can’t decide even  my own appearance just  soon  i’ve decided  i’m pretty i begin  feel miserably  i’m not besides have  horrible old greataunt who  always saying  me   mournful sigh ‘you  such  pretty baby it’s strange how children change when they grow up’ i adore aunts but i detest greataunts please tell me quite often  i am pretty if you don’t mind i feel so much more comfortable when i can believe i’m pretty and i’ll  just  obliging  you if you want me toi can be   clear conscience” “thanks” laughed anne “but priscilla  i  so firmly convinced  our own good looks  we don’t need any assurance about them so you needn’t trouble” “oh you’re laughing  me i know you think i’m abominably vain but i’m not there really isn’t one spark  vanity  me and i’m never  bit grudging about paying compliments  other girls when they deserve them i’m so glad i know you folks i came up  saturday  i’ve nearly died  homesickness ever since it’s  horrible feeling isn’t it in bolingbroke i’m  important personage   kingsport i’m just nobody there  times when i could feel my soul turning  delicate blue where do you hang out” “thirtyeight st john’s street” “better  better why i’m just around  corner  wallace street i don’t like my boardinghouse though it’s bleak  lonesome  my room looks out  such  unholy back yard it’s  ugliest place   world as  catswell surely all  kingsport cats can’t congregate there  night but half  them must i adore cats  hearth rugs snoozing before nice friendly fires but cats  back yards  midnight  totally different animals the first night i  here i cried all night  so did  cats you should have seen my nose   morning how i wished i had never left home” “i don’t know how you managed  make up your mind  come  redmond  all if you  really such  undecided person” said amused priscilla “bless your heart honey i didn’t it  father who wanted me  come here his heart  set  itwhy i don’t know it seems perfectly ridiculous  think  me studying   ba degree doesn’t it not but what i can do it all right i have heaps  brains” “oh” said priscilla vaguely “yes but it’s such hard work  use them and ba’s  such learned dignified wise solemn creaturesthey must be no i didn’t want  come  redmond i did  just  oblige father he is such  duck besides i knew if i stayed home i’d have  get married mother wanted thatwanted  decidedly mother  plenty  decision but i really hated  thought  being married   few years yet i want  have heaps  fun before i settle down and ridiculous   idea  my being  ba is  idea  my being  old married woman  still more absurd isn’t it i’m only eighteen no i concluded i would rather come  redmond than  married besides how could i ever have made up my mind which man  marry” “were there so many” laughed anne “heaps the boys like me awfullythey really do but there  only two  mattered the rest  all too young  too poor i must marry  rich man you know” “why must you” “honey you couldn’t imagine me being  poor man’s wife could you i can’t do  single useful thing  i am very extravagant oh no my husband must have heaps  money so  narrowed them down  two but i couldn’t decide between two any easier than between two hundred i knew perfectly well  whichever one i chose i’d regret all my life  i hadn’t married  other” “didn’t youloveeither  them” asked anne  little hesitatingly it  not easy  her  speak   stranger   great mystery  transformation  life “goodness no i couldn’t love anybody it isn’t  me besides i wouldn’t want to being  love makes you  perfect slave i think and  would give  man such power  hurt you i’d  afraid no no alec  alonzo  two dear boys  i like them both so much  i really don’t know which i like  better that   trouble alec   best looking  course  i simply couldn’t marry  man who wasn’t handsome he  goodtempered too   lovely curly black hair he’s rather too perfecti don’t believe i’d like  perfect husbandsomebody i could never find fault with” “then why not marry alonzo” asked priscilla gravely “think  marrying  name like alonzo” said phil dolefully “i don’t believe i could endure it but    classic nose   would   comfort  have  nose   family  could  depended on i can’t depend  mine so far  takes after  gordon pattern but i’m so afraid   develop byrne tendencies  i grow older i examine  every day anxiously  make sure it’s still gordon mother   byrne    byrne nose   byrnest degree wait

both up together shut my eyes  jabbed   hatpinit would have been quite easy” “what did alec  alonzo feel like when you came away” queried priscilla “oh they still have hope i told them they’d have  wait till i could make up my mind they’re quite willing  wait they both worship me you know meanwhile i intend  have  good time i expect i shall have heaps  beaux  redmond i can’t  happy unless i have you know but don’t you think  freshmen  fearfully homely i saw only one really handsome fellow among them he went away before you came i heard his chum call him gilbert his chum had eyes  stuck out that far but you’re not going yet girls don’t go yet” “i think we must” said anne rather coldly “it’s getting late  i’ve some work  do” “but you’ll both come  see me won’t you” asked philippa getting up  putting  arm around each “and let me come  see you i want   chummy  you i’ve taken such  fancy  you both and i haven’t quite disgusted you  my frivolity have i” “not quite” laughed anne responding  phil’s squeeze   return  cordiality “because i’m not half so silly  i seem   surface you know you just accept philippa gordon   lord made her  all her faults  i believe you’ll come  like her isn’t this graveyard  sweet place i’d love   buried here here’s  grave i didn’t see beforethis one   iron railingoh girls look seethe stone says it’s  grave   middy who  killed   fight between  shannon   chesapeake just fancy” anne paused   railing  looked   worn stone her pulses thrilling  sudden excitement the old graveyard   overarching trees  long aisles  shadows faded  her sight instead she saw  kingsport harbor  nearly  century agone out   mist came slowly  great frigate brilliant  “the meteor flag  england” behind her  another   still heroic form wrapped  his own starry flag lying   quarter

“you’re  hundred years away  us come back” anne came back   sigh her eyes  shining softly “i’ve always loved  old story” she said “and although  english won  victory i think   because   brave defeated commander i love it this grave seems  bring  so near  make  so real this poor little middy  only eighteen he ‘died  desperate wounds received  gallant action’so reads his epitaph it  such   soldier might wish for” before she turned away anne unpinned  little cluster  purple pansies she wore  dropped  softly   grave   boy who had perished   great seaduel “well what do you think  our new friend” asked priscilla when phil had left them “i like her there  something very lovable about her  spite  all her nonsense i believe  she says herself  she isn’t half  silly  she sounds she’s  dear kissable babyand i don’t know  she’ll ever really grow up” “i like her too” said priscilla decidedly “she talks  much about boys  ruby gillis does but  always enrages or sickens me  hear ruby whereas i just wanted  laugh goodnaturedly  phil now what   why  that” “there   difference” said anne meditatively “i think it’s because ruby  really so conscious  boys she plays  love  lovemaking besides you feel when she  boasting  her beaux  she  doing   rub  well into you  you haven’t half so many now when phil talks  her beaux  sounds  if she  just speaking  chums she really looks upon boys  good comrades  she  pleased when she  dozens  them tagging round simply because she likes   popular    thought popular even alex  alonzoi’ll never  able  think  those two names separately after thisare  her just two

found  studies  her freshman year very easy thanks  great part   steady work she  gilbert had put  during those two past years  avonlea this left her more time   social life which she thoroughly enjoyed but never   moment did she forget avonlea   friends there to her  happiest moments  each week  those  which letters came  home it  not until she had got her first letters  she began  think she could ever like kingsport or feel  home there before they came avonlea had seemed thousands  miles away those letters brought  near  linked  old life   new so closely  they began  seem one   same instead  two hopelessly segregated existences the first batch contained six letters  jane andrews ruby gillis diana barry marilla mrs lynde  davy jane’s   copperplate production  every “t” nicely crossed  every “i” precisely dotted  not  interesting sentence  it she never mentioned  school concerning which anne  avid  hear she never answered one   questions anne had asked  her letter but she told anne how many yards  lace she had recently crocheted   kind  weather they  having  avonlea  how she intended  have her new dress made   way she felt when her head ached ruby gillis wrote  gushing epistle deploring anne’s absence assuring her she  horribly missed  everything asking what  redmond “fellows”  like  filling  rest  accounts  her own harrowing experiences  her numerous admirers it   silly harmless letter  anne would have laughed over  had  not been   postscript “gilbert seems   enjoying redmond judging  his letters” wrote ruby “i don’t think charlie  so stuck  it” so gilbert  writing  ruby very well he had  perfect right to  course only anne did not know  ruby had written  first letter   gilbert had answered   mere courtesy she tossed ruby’s letter aside contemptuously but  took all diana’s breezy newsy delightful epistle  banish  sting  ruby’s postscript diana’s letter contained  little too much fred but  otherwise crowded  crossed  items  interest  anne almost felt herself back  avonlea while reading it marilla’s   rather prim  colorless epistle severely innocent  gossip or emotion yet somehow  conveyed  anne  whiff   wholesome simple life  green gables   savor  ancient peace   steadfast abiding love   there  her mrs lynde’s letter  full  church news having broken up housekeeping mrs lynde had more time than ever  devote  church affairs  had flung herself into them heart  soul she   present much worked up over  poor “supplies” they  having   vacant avonlea pulpit “i don’t believe any but fools enter  ministry nowadays” she wrote bitterly “such candidates  they have sent us  such stuff  they preach half   ain’t true and what’s worse  ain’t sound doctrine the one we have now   worst   lot he mostly takes  text  preaches about something else and  says  doesn’t believe all  heathen   eternally lost the idea if they won’t all  money we’ve been giving  foreign missions   clean wasted that’s what last sunday night  announced  next sunday he’d

chapter vi in  park “what  you going  do  yourselves today girls” asked philippa popping into anne’s room one saturday afternoon “we  going   walk   park” answered anne “i ought  stay   finish my blouse but i couldn’t sew   day like this there’s something   air  gets into my blood  makes  sort  glory  my soul my fingers would twitch  i’d sew  crooked seam so it’s ho   park   pines” “does ‘we’ include any one but yourself  priscilla” “yes  includes gilbert  charlie  we’ll  very glad if   include you also” “but” said philippa dolefully “if i go i’ll have   gooseberry      new experience  philippa gordon” “well new experiences  broadening come along  you’ll  able  sympathize  all poor souls who have  play gooseberry often but where  all  victims” “oh i  tired  them all  simply couldn’t

addressed them but i didn’t seal them up that evening something funny happened that is alec would think  funny but alonzo wouldn’t  likely to i    hurry so i snatched alec’s letteras i thoughtout   envelope  scribbled down  postscript then i mailed both letters i got alonzo’s reply this morning girls i had put  postscript  his letter    furious of course he’ll get over itand i don’t care if  doesn’tbut  spoiled my day so i thought i’d come  you darlings  get cheered up after  football season opens i won’t have any spare saturday afternoons i adore football i’ve got  most gorgeous cap  sweater striped  redmond colors  wear   games to  sure  little way off i’ll look like  walking barber’s pole do you know   gilbert  yours  been elected captain   freshman football team” “yes  told us so last evening” said priscilla seeing  outraged anne would not answer “he  charlie  down we knew they  coming so we painstakingly put out  sight or out  reach all miss ada’s cushions that very elaborate one   raised embroidery i dropped   floor   corner behind  chair   on i thought  would  safe there but would you believe it charlie sloane made   chair noticed  cushion behind it solemnly fished  up  sat    whole evening such  wreck   cushion   was poor miss ada asked me today still smiling but oh so reproachfully why i had allowed    sat upon i told her i hadn’tthat    matter  predestination coupled  inveterate sloanishness  i wasn’t  match  both combined” “miss ada’s cushions  really getting  my nerves” said anne “she finished two new ones last week stuffed  embroidered within  inch  their lives there being absolutely no other cushionless place  put them she stood them up against  wall   stair landing they topple over half  time  if we come up or down  stairs   dark we fall over them last sunday when dr davis prayed  all those exposed   perils   sea i added  thought ‘and  all those who live  houses where cushions  loved not wisely but too well’ there we’re ready  i see  boys coming through old st john’s do you cast  your lot  us phil” “i’ll go if i can walk  priscilla  charlie that    bearable degree  gooseberry that gilbert  yours   darling anne but why does  go around so much  goggleeyes” anne stiffened she had no great liking  charlie sloane but    avonlea so no outsider had any business  laugh  him “charlie  gilbert have always been friends” she said coldly “charlie   nice boy he’s not  blame  his eyes” “don’t tell me that he is he must have done something dreadful   previous existence   punished  such eyes pris  i  going  have such sport  him this afternoon we’ll make fun  him  his face  he’ll never know it” doubtless “the abandoned p’s”  anne called them did carry out their amiable intentions but sloane  blissfully ignorant  thought   quite  fine fellow   walking  two such coeds especially philippa gordon  class beauty  belle it must surely impress anne she would see  some people appreciated him  his real value gilbert  anne loitered  little behind  others enjoying  calm still beauty   autumn afternoon under  pines   park   road  climbed  twisted round  harbor shore “the silence here  like  prayer isn’t it” said anne her face upturned   shining sky “how i love  pines they seem  strike their roots deep into  romance  all  ages it  so comforting  creep away now  then   good talk  them i always feel so happy out here” “‘and so  mountain solitudes o’ertaken as  some spell divine their cares drop  them like  needles shaken from out  gusty pine’” quoted gilbert “they make our little ambitions seem rather petty don’t they anne” “i think if ever any great sorrow came  me i would come   pines  comfort” said anne dreamily “i hope no great sorrow ever  come  you anne” said gilbert who could not connect  idea  sorrow   vivid joyous creature beside him unwitting  those who can soar   highest heights can also plunge   deepest depths    natures which enjoy most keenly  those which also suffer most sharply “but there mustsometime” mused anne “life seems like  cup  glory held  my lips just now but there must  some bitterness  itthere   every cup i shall taste mine some day well i hope i shall  strong  brave  meet it and i hope  won’t  through my own fault    come do you remember what dr davis said last sunday eveningthat  sorrows god sent us brought comfort  strength  them while  sorrows we brought  ourselves through folly or wickedness   far  hardest  bear but we mustn’t talk  sorrow   afternoon like this it’s meant   sheer joy  living isn’t it” “if i had my way i’d shut everything out  your life but happiness  pleasure anne” said gilbert   tone  meant “danger ahead” “then you would  very unwise” rejoined anne hastily “i’m sure no life can  properly developed  rounded out without some trial  sorrowthough i suppose   only when we  pretty comfortable  we admit it comethe others have got   pavilion   beckoning  us” they all sat down   little pavilion  watch  autumn sunset  deep red fire  pallid gold to their left lay kingsport  roofs  spires dim  their shroud  violet smoke to their right lay  harbor taking  tints  rose  copper   stretched out into  sunset before them  water shimmered satin smooth  silver gray  beyond clean shaven william’s island loomed out   mist guarding  town like  sturdy bulldog its lighthouse beacon flared through  mist like  baleful star   answered  another   far horizon “did you ever see such  stronglooking place” asked philippa “i don’t want william’s island especially but i’m sure i couldn’t get  if i did look   sentry   summit   fort right beside  flag doesn’t  look  if  had stepped out   romance” “speaking  romance” said priscilla “we’ve been looking  heatherbut  course we couldn’t find any it’s too late   season i suppose” “heather” exclaimed anne “heather doesn’t grow  america does it” “there  just two patches     whole continent” said phil “one right here   park  one somewhere else  nova scotia i forget where the famous highland regiment  black watch camped here one year and when  men shook out  straw  their beds   spring some seeds  heather took root” “oh how delightful” said enchanted anne “let’s go home around  spofford avenue” suggested gilbert “we can see all ‘the handsome houses where  wealthy nobles dwell’ spofford avenue   finest residential street  kingsport nobody can build   unless he’s  millionaire” “oh do” said phil “there’s  perfectly killing little place i want  show you anne it wasn’t built   millionaire it’s  first place after you leave  park  must have grown while spofford avenue  still  country road it did growit wasn’t built i don’t care   houses   avenue they’re too brand new  plateglassy but this little spot   dreamand  namebut wait till you see it” they saw   they walked up  pinefringed hill   park just   crest where spofford avenue petered out into  plain road   little white frame house  groups  pines  either side  it stretching their arms protectingly over  low roof it  covered  red  gold vines through which  greenshuttered windows peeped before    tiny garden surrounded   low stone wall october though  was  garden  still very sweet  dear oldfashioned unworldly flowers  shrubssweet may

being made “it’s  dearest place i ever saw” said anne delightedly “it gives me one  my old delightful funny aches it’s dearer  quainter than even miss lavendar’s stone house” “it’s  name i want you  notice especially” said phil “lookin white letters around  archway over  gate ‘patty’s place’ isn’t  killing especially  this avenue  pinehursts  elmwolds  cedarcrofts ‘patty’s place’ if you please i adore it” “have you any idea who patty is” asked priscilla “patty spofford   name   old lady who owns it i’ve discovered she lives there  her niece  they’ve lived there  hundreds  years more or lessmaybe  little less anne exaggeration  merely  flight  poetic fancy i understand  wealthy folk have tried  buy  lot time  againit’s really worth  small fortune now you knowbut ‘patty’ won’t sell upon any consideration and there’s  apple orchard behind  house  place   back yardyou’ll see  when we get  little pasta real apple orchard  spofford avenue” “i’m going  dream about ‘patty’s place’ tonight” said anne “why i feel  if i belonged  it i wonder if  any chance we’ll ever see  inside  it” “it isn’t likely” said priscilla anne smiled mysteriously “no  isn’t likely but i believe   happen i have  queer creepy crawly feelingyou can call   presentiment if you likethat ‘patty’s place’  i  going   better acquainted yet” chapter vii home again those first three weeks  redmond had seemed long but  rest   term flew   wings  wind before they realized   redmond students found themselves   grind  christmas examinations emerging therefrom more or less triumphantly the honor  leading   freshman classes fluctuated between anne gilbert  philippa priscilla did very well charlie sloane scraped through respectably  comported himself  complacently  if  had led  everything “i can’t really believe  this time tomorrow i’ll   green gables” said anne   night before departure “but i shall be and you phil    bolingbroke  alec  alonzo” “i’m longing  see them” admitted phil between  chocolate she  nibbling “they really  such dear boys you know there’s   no end  dances  drives  general jamborees i shall never forgive you queen anne  not coming home  me   holidays” “‘never’ means three days  you phil it  dear  you  ask meand i’d love  go  bolingbroke some day but i can’t go this yeari must go home you don’t know how my heart longs  it” “you won’t have much   time” said phil scornfully “there’ll  one or two quilting parties i suppose  all  old gossips  talk you over  your face  behind your back you’ll die  lonesomeness child” “in avonlea” said anne highly amused “now if you’d come  me you’d have  perfectly gorgeous time bolingbroke would go wild over you queen anneyour hair  your style and oh everything you’re so different you’d  such  successand i would bask  reflected glory‘not  rose but near  rose’ do come after all anne” “your picture  social triumphs  quite fascinating phil but i’ll paint one  offset it i’m going home   old country farmhouse once green rather faded now set among leafless apple orchards there   brook below   december fir wood beyond where i’ve heard harps swept   fingers  rain  wind there   pond nearby    gray  brooding now there   two oldish ladies   house one tall  thin one short  fat  there   two twins one  perfect model  other what mrs lynde calls  ‘holy terror’ there    little room upstairs over  porch where old dreams hang thick   big fat glorious feather bed which  almost seem  height  luxury after  boardinghouse mattress how do you like my picture phil” “it seems  very dull one” said phil   grimace “oh but i’ve left out  transforming thing” said anne softly “there’ll  love there philfaithful tender love such  i’ll never find anywhere else   worldlove that’s waiting  me that makes my picture  masterpiece doesn’t it even if  colors  not very brilliant” phil silently got up tossed her box  chocolates away went up  anne  put her arms about her “anne i wish i  like you” she said soberly diana met anne   carmody station  next night  they drove home together under silent starsown depths  sky green gables had  very festal appearance  they drove up  lane there   light  every window  glow breaking out through  darkness like flamered blossoms swung against  dark background   haunted wood and   yard   brave bonfire  two gay little figures dancing around it one  which gave  unearthly yell   buggy turned  under  poplars “davy means    indian warwhoop” said diana “mr harrison’s hired boy taught   him  he’s been practicing  up  welcome you with mrs lynde says   worn her nerves   frazzle he creeps up behind her you know  then lets go he  determined  have  bonfire  you too he’s been piling up branches   fortnight  pestering marilla   let pour some kerosene oil over  before setting   fire i guess she did   smell though mrs lynde said up   last  davy would blow himself  everybody else up if   let” anne  out   buggy  this time  davy  rapturously hugging her knees while even dora  clinging  her hand “isn’t   bully bonfire anne just let me show you how  poke itsee  sparks i did   you anne ‘cause i  so glad you  coming home” the kitchen door opened  marilla’s spare form darkened against  inner light she preferred  meet anne   shadows  she  horribly afraid  she  going  cry  joyshe stern repressed marilla who thought all display  deep emotion unseemly mrs lynde  behind her sonsy kindly matronly   yore the love  anne had told phil  waiting  her surrounded her  enfolded her   blessing   sweetness nothing after all could compare  old ties old friends  old green gables how starry anne’s eyes   they sat down   loaded supper table how pink her cheeks how silverclear her laughter and diana  going  stay all night too how like  dear old times  was and  rosebud teaset graced  table with marilla  force  nature could no further go “i suppose you  diana  now proceed  talk all night” said marilla sarcastically   girls went upstairs marilla  always sarcastic after any selfbetrayal “yes” agreed anne gaily “but i’m going  put davy  bed first he insists  that” “you bet” said davy  they went along  hall “i want somebody  say my prayers  again it’s no fun saying them alone” “you don’t say them alone davy god  always  you  hear you” “well i can’t see him” objected davy “i want  pray  somebody i can see but i won’t say them  mrs lynde or marilla there now” nevertheless when davy  garbed  his gray flannel nighty  did not seem   hurry  begin he stood before anne shuffling one bare foot over  other  looked undecided “come dear kneel down” said anne davy came  buried his head  anne’s lap but  did not kneel down “anne”  said   muffled voice “i don’t feel like praying after all i haven’t felt like    week now ii didn’t pray last night nor  night before” “why not davy” asked anne gently “youyou won’t  mad if i tell you” implored davy anne lifted  little grayflannelled body  her knee  cuddled his head  her arm “do i ever get ‘mad’ when you tell me things davy” “nooo you never do but you get sorry  that’s worse you’ll  awful sorry when i tell you this anneand you’ll  ‘shamed  me i s’pose” “have you done something naughty davy    why you can’t say your prayers” “no i haven’t done anything naughtyyet but i want  do it” “what  it davy” “ii want  say  bad word anne” blurted out davy   desperate effort “i heard mr harrison’s hired boy say  one day last week  ever since i’ve been wanting  say  all  timeeven when i’m saying my prayers” “say  then davy” davy lifted his flushed face  amazement “but anne it’s  awful bad word” “say it” davy gave her another incredulous look then   low voice  said  dreadful word the next minute his face  burrowing against her “oh anne i’ll never say  againnever i’ll never want  say  again i knew   bad but i didn’t s’pose   sosoi didn’t s’pose   like that” “no i don’t think you’ll ever want  say  again davyor think it either and i wouldn’t go about much  mr harrison’s hired boy if i  you” “he can make bully warwhoops” said davy  little regretfully “but you don’t want your mind filled  bad words do you davywords   poison   drive out all   good  manly” “no” said davy owleyed  introspection “then don’t go  those people who use them and now do you feel  if you could say your prayers davy” “oh yes” said davy eagerly wriggling down  his knees “i can say them now all right i ain’t scared now  say ‘if i should die before i wake’ like i  when i  wanting  say  word” probably anne  diana did empty out their souls  each other  night but no record  their confidences  been preserved they both looked  fresh  brighteyed  breakfast  only youth can look after

andrews who had come up  spend  afternoon  stay all night but when they  cuddled between their blankets  anne’s little porch room   not her mercies  which jane  thinking “anne” she said very solemnly “i want  tell you something may i” anne  feeling rather sleepy after  party ruby gillis had given  night before she would much rather have gone  sleep than listen  jane’s confidences which she  sure would bore her she had no prophetic inkling  what  coming probably jane  engaged too rumor averred  ruby gillis  engaged   spencervale schoolteacher about whom all  girls  said   quite wild “i’ll soon   only fancyfree maiden  our old quartet” thought anne drowsily aloud she said “of course” “anne” said jane still more solemnly “what do you think  my brother billy” anne gasped over this unexpected question  floundered helplessly  her thoughts goodness what did she think  billy andrews she had never thought anything about himroundfaced stupid perpetually smiling goodnatured billy andrews did anybody ever think about billy andrews “ii don’t understand jane” she stammered “what do you meanexactly” “do you like billy” asked jane bluntly “whywhyyes i like him  course” gasped anne wondering if she  telling  literal truth certainly she did not dislike billy but could  indifferent tolerance  which she regarded him when  happened    her range  vision  considered positive enough  liking what  jane trying  elucidate “would you like him   husband” asked jane calmly “a husband” anne had been sitting up  bed  better  wrestle   problem  her exact opinion  billy andrews now she fell flatly back  her pillows  very breath gone out  her “whose husband” “yours  course” answered jane “billy wants  marry you he’s always been crazy about youand now father  given him  upper farm  his own name  there’s nothing  prevent him  getting married but he’s so shy  couldn’t ask you himself if you’d have him so  got me  do it i’d rather not have but  gave me no peace till i said i would if i got  good

neither  jane’s feelings must not  hurt “ii couldn’t marry bill you know jane” she managed  gasp “why such  idea never occurred  menever” “i don’t suppose  did” agreed jane “billy  always been far too shy  think  courting but you might think  over anne billy   good fellow i must say that if   my brother he  no bad habits  he’s  great worker  you can depend  him ‘a bird   hand  worth two   bush’ he told me  tell you he’d  quite willing  wait till you got through college if you insisted though he’d rather get married this spring before  planting begins he’d always  very good  you i’m sure  you know anne i’d love  have you   sister” “i can’t marry billy” said anne decidedly she had recovered her wits   even feeling  little angry it  all so ridiculous “there  no use thinking  it jane i don’t care anything  him   way  you must tell him so” “well i didn’t suppose you would” said jane   resigned sigh feeling  she had done her best “i told billy i didn’t believe    bit  use  ask you but  insisted well you’ve made your decision anne  i hope you won’t regret it” jane spoke rather coldly she had been perfectly sure   enamored billy had no chance  all  inducing anne  marry him nevertheless she felt  little resentment  anne shirley who was after all merely  adopted orphan without kith or kin should refuse her brotherone   avonlea andrews well pride sometimes goes before

she’s such  good manager  saver i think when billy  once sure you won’t have him he’ll take nettie please don’t mention this  any one  you anne” “certainly not” said anne who had no desire whatever

sorrowfully “you’ve let   some one else” “no but we have decided not  let   all” “oh i’m so sorry” exclaimed anne impulsively “i love this place so i did hope we could have got it” then did miss patty lay down her knitting take off her specs rub them put them  again    first time look  anne    human being the other lady followed her example so perfectly  she might  well have been  reflection   mirror “you love it” said miss patty  emphasis “does  mean  you really love it or  you merely like  looks  it the girls nowadays indulge  such exaggerated statements  one never can tell what they do mean it wasn’t so  my young days then  girl did not say she loved turnips  just  same tone  she might have said she loved her mother or her savior” anne’s conscience bore her up “i really do love it” she said gently “i’ve loved  ever since i saw  last fall my two college chums  i want  keep house next year instead  boarding so we  looking   little place  rent  when i saw  this house   let i  so happy” “if you love it you can have it” said miss patty “maria  i decided today  we would not let  after all because we did not like any   people who have wanted it we don’t have  let it we can afford  go  europe even if we don’t let it it would help us out but not  gold  i let my home pass into  possession  such people  have come here  looked  it you  different i believe you do love     good  it

quite so much” said anne choking back her disappointment “you see we  only college girls  we  poor” “what  you thinking you could afford” demanded miss patty ceasing not  knit anne named her amount miss patty nodded gravely “that  do as i told you   not strictly necessary  we should let   all we  not rich but we have enough  go  europe on i have never been  europe  my life  never expected or wanted  go but my niece there maria spofford  taken  fancy  go now you know  young person like maria can’t go globetrotting alone” “noii suppose not” murmured anne seeing  miss patty  quite solemnly  earnest “of course not so i have  go along  look after her i expect  enjoy it too i’m seventy years old but i’m not tired  living yet i daresay i’d have gone  europe before if  idea had occurred  me we shall  away  two years perhaps three we sail  june  we shall send you  key  leave all  order  you  take possession when you choose we shall pack away  few things we prize especially but all  rest   left” “will you leave  china dogs” asked anne timidly “would you like me to” “oh indeed yes they  delightful” a pleased expression came into miss patty’s face “i think  great deal  those dogs” she said proudly “they  over  hundred years old  they have sat  either side  this fireplace ever since my brother aaron brought them  london fifty years ago spofford avenue  called after my brother aaron” “a fine man  was” said miss maria speaking   first time “ah you don’t see  like  him nowadays” “he   good uncle  you maria” said miss patty  evident emotion “you do well  remember him” “i shall always remember him” said miss maria solemnly “i can see him this minute standing there before  fire  his hands under his coattails beaming  us” miss maria took out her handkerchief  wiped her eyes but miss patty came resolutely back   regions  sentiment  those  business “i shall leave  dogs where they are if you  promise   very careful  them” she said “their names  gog  magog gog looks   right  magog   left and there’s just one thing more you don’t object i hope  this house being called patty’s place” “no indeed we think   one   nicest things about it” “you have sense i see” said miss patty   tone  great satisfaction “would you believe it all  people who came here  rent  house wanted  know if they couldn’t take  name off  gate during their occupation  it i told them roundly   name went   house this  been patty’s place ever since my brother aaron left   me  his will  patty’s place  shall remain until i die  maria dies after  happens  next possessor can call  any fool name  likes” concluded

abe” his prophesying over  done with mrs peter sloane who had sighed     hoped   last time timothy cotton who  mrs rachel lynde said “had actually managed  die  last after practicing    twenty years”  old josiah sloane whom nobody knew  his coffin because  had his whiskers neatly trimmed  all sleeping   little graveyard behind  church and billy andrews  married  nettie blewett they “appeared out”  sunday when billy beaming  pride  happiness showed his beplumed  besilked bride into  harmon andrews’ pew anne dropped her lids  hide her dancing eyes she recalled  stormy winter night   christmas holidays when jane had proposed  billy he certainly had not broken his heart over his rejection anne wondered if jane had also proposed  nettie  him or if  had mustered enough spunk  ask  fateful question himself all  andrews family seemed  share  his pride  pleasure  mrs harmon   pew  jane   choir jane had resigned   avonlea school  intended  go west   fall “can’t get  beau  avonlea that’s what” said mrs rachel lynde scornfully “says she thinks she’ll have better health out west i never heard her health  poor before” “jane   nice girl” anne had said loyally “she never tried  attract attention  some did” “oh she never chased  boys if that’s what you mean” said mrs rachel “but she’d like   married just  much  anybody that’s what what else would take her out west  some forsaken place whose only recommendation   men  plenty  women scarce don’t you tell me” but   not  jane anne gazed  day  dismay  surprise it   ruby gillis who sat beside her   choir what had happened  ruby she  even handsomer than ever but her blue eyes  too bright  lustrous   color  her cheeks  hectically brilliant besides she  very thin  hands  held her hymnbook  almost transparent  their delicacy “is ruby gillis ill” anne asked  mrs lynde  they went home  church “ruby gillis  dying  galloping consumption” said mrs lynde bluntly “everybody knows  except herself  her family they won’t give in if you ask them she’s perfectly well she hasn’t been able  teach since she had  attack  congestion   winter but she says she’s going  teach again   fall  she’s after  white sands school she’ll   her grave poor girl when white sands school opens that’s what” anne listened  shocked silence ruby gillis her old schoolchum dying could   possible of late years they had grown apart but  old tie  schoolgirl intimacy  there  made itself felt sharply   tug  news gave  anne’s heartstrings ruby  brilliant  merry  coquettish it  impossible  associate  thought  her  anything like death she had greeted anne  gay cordiality after church  urged her  come up  next evening “i’ll  away tuesday  wednesday evenings” she had whispered triumphantly “there’s  concert  carmody   party  white sands herb spencer’s going  take me he’s my latest be sure  come up tomorrow i’m dying   good talk  you i want  hear all about your doings  redmond” anne knew  ruby meant  she wanted  tell anne all about her own recent flirtations but she promised  go  diana offered  go  her “i’ve been wanting  go  see ruby   long while” she told anne when they left green gables  next evening “but i really couldn’t go alone it’s so awful  hear ruby rattling   she does  pretending there  nothing  matter  her even when she can hardly speak  coughing she’s fighting so hard  her life  yet she hasn’t any chance  all they say” the girls walked silently down  red twilit road the robins  singing vespers   high treetops filling  golden air  their jubilant voices the silver fluting   frogs came  marshes  ponds over fields where seeds  beginning  stir  life  thrill   sunshine  rain  had drifted over them the air  fragrant   wild sweet wholesome smell  young raspberry copses white mists  hovering   silent hollows  violet stars  shining bluely   brooklands “what  beautiful sunset” said diana “look anne it’s just like  land  itself isn’t it that long low back  purple cloud   shore   clear sky further   like  golden sea” “if we could sail     moonshine boat paul wrote   his old compositionyou rememberhow nice  would be” said anne rousing  her reverie “do you think we could find all our yesterdays there dianaall our old springs  blossoms the beds  flowers  paul saw there   roses  have bloomed  us   past” “don’t” said diana “you make me feel  if we  old women  everything  life behind us” “i think i’ve almost felt  if we  since i heard about poor ruby” said anne “if   true  she  dying any other sad thing might  true too” “you don’t mind calling   elisha wright’s   moment do you” asked diana “mother asked me  leave this little dish  jelly  aunt atossa” “who  aunt atossa” “oh haven’t you heard she’s mrs samson coates  spencervalemrs elisha wright’s aunt she’s father’s aunt too her husband died last winter  she  left very poor  lonely so  wrights took her  live  them mother thought we ought  take her but father put his foot down live  aunt atossa  would not” “is she so terrible” asked anne absently “you’ll probably see what she’s like before we can get away” said diana significantly “father says she   face like  hatchetit cuts  air but her tongue  sharper still” late    aunt atossa  cutting potato sets   wright kitchen she wore  faded old wrapper  her gray hair  decidedly untidy aunt atossa did not like being “caught   kilter” so she went out  her way   disagreeable “oh so you’re anne shirley” she said when diana introduced anne “i’ve heard  you” her tone implied  she had heard nothing good “mrs andrews  telling me you  home she said you had improved  good deal” there  no doubt aunt atossa thought there  plenty  room  further improvement she ceased not  cutting sets  much energy “is  any use  ask you  sit down” she inquired sarcastically “of course there’s nothing very entertaining here  you the rest  all away” “mother sent you this little pot  rhubarb jelly” said diana pleasantly “she made  today  thought you might like some” “oh thanks” said aunt atossa sourly “i never fancy your mother’s jellyshe always makes  too sweet however i’ll try  worry some down my appetite’s been dreadful poor this spring i’m far  well” continued aunt atossa solemnly “but still i keep adoing people who can’t work aren’t wanted here if  isn’t too much trouble  you  condescending enough  set  jelly   pantry i’m   hurry  get these spuds done tonight i suppose you two ladies never do anything like this you’d  afraid  spoiling your hands” “i used  cut potato sets before we rented  farm” smiled anne “i do  yet” laughed diana “i cut sets three days last week of course” she added teasingly “i did my hands up  lemon juice  kid gloves every night after it” aunt atossa sniffed “i suppose you got  notion out  some  those silly magazines you read so many of i wonder your mother allows you but she always spoiled you we all thought when george married her she wouldn’t   suitable wife  him” aunt atossa sighed heavily  if all forebodings upon  occasion  george barry’s marriage had been amply  darkly fulfilled “going  you” she inquired   girls rose “well i suppose you can’t find much amusement talking   old woman like me it’s such  pity  boys ain’t home” “we want  run   see ruby gillis  little while” explained diana “oh anything does   excuse  course” said aunt atossa amiably “just whip   whip out before you have time  say howdo decently it’s college airs i s’pose you’d  wiser  keep away  ruby gillis the doctors say consumption’s catching i always knew ruby’d get something gadding off  boston last fall   visit people who ain’t content  stay home always catch something” “people who don’t go visiting catch things too sometimes they even die” said diana solemnly “then they don’t have themselves  blame  it” retorted aunt atossa triumphantly “i hear you    married  june diana” “there  no truth   report” said diana blushing “well don’t put  off too long” said aunt atossa significantly “you’ll fade soonyou’re all complexion  hair and  wrights  terrible fickle you ought  wear  hat miss shirley your nose  freckling scandalous my but you are redheaded well i s’pose we’re all   lord made us give marilla cuthbert my respects she’s never been  see me since i come  avonlea but i s’pose i oughtn’t  complain the cuthberts always did think themselves  cut higher than any one else round here” “oh isn’t she dreadful” gasped diana  they escaped down  lane “she’s worse than miss eliza andrews” said anne “but then think  living all your life   name like atossa wouldn’t  sour almost any one she should have tried  imagine her name  cordelia it might have helped her  great deal it certainly helped me   days when i didn’t like anne” “josie pye   just like her when she grows up” said diana “josie’s mother  aunt atossa  cousins you know oh dear i’m glad that’s over she’s so maliciousshe seems  put  bad flavor  everything father tells such  funny story about her one time they had  minister  spencervale who   very good spiritual man but very deaf he couldn’t hear any ordinary conversation  all well they used  have  prayer meeting  sunday evenings  all  church members present would get up  pray  turn or say  few words  some bible verse but one evening aunt atossa bounced up she didn’t either pray or preach instead she lit into everybody else   church  gave them  fearful raking down calling them right out  name  telling them how they all had behaved  casting up all  quarrels  scandals   past ten years finally she wound up  saying  she  disgusted  spencervale church  she never meant  darken  door again  she hoped  fearful judgment would come upon it then she sat down out  breath   minister who hadn’t heard  word she said immediately remarked   very devout voice ‘amen the lord grant our dear sister’s prayer’ you ought  hear father tell  story” “speaking  stories diana” remarked anne   significant confidential tone “do you know  lately i have been wondering if i could write  short storya story  would  good enough   published” “why  course you could” said diana after she had grasped  amazing suggestion “you used  write perfectly thrilling stories years ago  our old story club” “well i hardly meant one   kind  stories” smiled anne “i’ve been thinking about   little  late but i’m almost afraid  try for if i should fail  would  too humiliating” “i heard priscilla say once  all mrs morgan’s first stories  rejected but i’m sure yours wouldn’t be anne  it’s likely editors have more sense nowadays” “margaret burton one   junior girls  redmond wrote  story last winter    published   canadian woman i really do think i could write one  least  good” “and  you have  published   canadian woman” “i might try one   bigger magazines first it all depends  what kind   story i write” “what     about” “i don’t know yet i want  get hold   good plot i believe this  very necessary   editor’s point  view the only thing i’ve settled    heroine’s name it    averil lester rather pretty don’t you think don’t mention this  any one diana i haven’t told anybody but you  mr harrison he wasn’t very encouraginghe said there  far too much trash written nowadays   was  he’d expected something better  me after  year  college” “what does mr harrison know about it” demanded diana scornfully they found  gillis home gay  lights  callers leonard kimball  spencervale  morgan bell  carmody  glaring  each other across  parlor several merry girls had dropped in ruby  dressed  white  her eyes  cheeks  very brilliant she laughed  chattered incessantly  after  other girls had gone she took anne upstairs  display her new summer dresses “i’ve  blue silk  make up yet but it’s  little heavy  summer wear i think i’ll leave  until  fall i’m going  teach  white sands you know how do you like my hat that one you had   church yesterday  real dinky but i like something brighter  myself did you notice those two ridiculous boys downstairs they’ve both come determined  sit each other out i don’t care  single bit about either  them you know herb spencer   one i like sometimes i really do think he’s mr right at christmas i thought  spencervale schoolmaster  that but i found out something about him  turned me against him he nearly went insane when i turned him down i wish those two boys hadn’t come tonight i wanted  have  nice good talk  you anne  tell you such heaps  things you  i  always good chums weren’t we” ruby slipped her arm about anne’s waist   shallow little laugh but just   moment their eyes met and behind all  luster  ruby’s anne saw something  made her heart ache “come up often won’t you anne” whispered ruby “come alonei want you” “are you feeling quite well ruby” “me why i’m perfectly well i never felt better  my life of course  congestion last winter pulled me down  little but just see my color i don’t look much like  invalid i’m sure” ruby’s voice  almost sharp she pulled her arm away  anne  if  resentment  ran downstairs where she  gayer than ever apparently so much absorbed  bantering her two swains  diana  anne felt rather out    soon went away chapter xii “averil’s atonement” “what  you dreaming of anne” the two girls  loitering one evening   fairy hollow   brook ferns nodded  it  little grasses  green  wild pears hung finelyscented white curtains around it anne roused herself  her reverie   happy sigh “i  thinking out my story diana” “oh have you really begun it” cried diana all alight  eager interest   moment “yes i have only  few pages written but i have  all pretty well thought out i’ve had such  time  get  suitable plot none   plots  suggested themselves suited  girl named averil” “couldn’t you have changed her name” “no  thing  impossible i tried to but i couldn’t do it any more than i could change yours averil  so real  me  no matter what other name i tried  give her i just thought  her  averil behind  all but finally i got  plot  matched her then came  excitement  choosing names  all my characters you have no idea how fascinating  is i’ve lain awake  hours thinking over those names the hero’s name  perceval dalrymple” “have you named all  characters” asked diana wistfully “if you hadn’t i  going  ask you  let me name onejust some unimportant person i’d feel  if i had  share   story then” “you may name  little hired boy who lived   lesters” conceded anne “he  not very important but    only one left unnamed” “call him raymond fitzosborne” suggested diana who had  store  such names laid away  her memory relics   old “story club” which she  anne  jane andrews  ruby gillis had had  their schooldays anne shook her head doubtfully “i’m afraid   too aristocratic  name   chore boy diana i couldn’t imagine  fitzosborne feeding pigs  picking up chips could you” diana didn’t see why if you had  imagination  all you couldn’t stretch    extent but probably anne knew best   chore boy  finally christened robert ray   called bobby should occasion require “how much do you suppose you’ll get  it” asked diana but anne had not thought about this  all she   pursuit  fame not filthy lucre  her literary dreams   yet untainted  mercenary considerations “you’ll let me read it won’t you” pleaded diana “when   finished i’ll read   you  mr harrison  i shall want you  criticize  severely no one else shall see  until   published” “how  you going  end ithappily or unhappily” “i’m not sure i’d like   end unhappily because  would  so much more romantic but i understand editors have  prejudice against sad endings i heard professor hamilton say once  nobody but  genius should try  write  unhappy ending and” concluded anne modestly “i’m anything but  genius” “oh i like happy endings best you’d better let him marry her” said diana who especially since her engagement  fred thought this  how every story should end “but you like  cry over stories” “oh yes   middle  them but i like everything  come right  last” “i must have one pathetic scene  it” said anne thoughtfully “i might let robert ray  injured   accident  have  death scene” “no you mustn’t kill bobby off” declared diana laughing “he belongs  me  i want him  live  flourish kill somebody else if you have to” for  next fortnight anne writhed or reveled according  mood  her literary pursuits now she would  jubilant over  brilliant idea now despairing because some contrary character would not behave properly diana could not understand this “make them do  you want them to” she said “i can’t” mourned anne “averil  such  unmanageable heroine she will do  say things i never meant her to then  spoils everything  went before  i have  write  all over again” finally however  story  finished  anne read   diana   seclusion   porch gable she had achieved her “pathetic scene” without sacrificing robert ray  she kept  watchful eye  diana  she read it diana rose   occasion  cried properly but when  end came she looked  little disappointed “why did you kill maurice lennox” she asked reproachfully “he   villain” protested anne “he had   punished” “i like him best  them all” said unreasonable diana “well he’s dead  he’ll have  stay dead” said anne rather resentfully “if i had let him live he’d have gone  persecuting averil  perceval” “yesunless you had reformed him” “that wouldn’t have been romantic and besides  would have made  story too long” “well anyway it’s  perfectly elegant story anne   make you famous   i’m sure have you got  title  it” “oh i decided   title long ago i call  averil’s atonement doesn’t  sound nice  alliterative now diana tell me candidly do you see any faults  my story” “well” hesitated diana “that part where averil makes  cake doesn’t seem  me quite romantic enough  match  rest it’s just what anybody might do heroines shouldn’t do cooking i think” “why   where  humor comes in  it’s one   best parts   whole story” said anne and  may  stated   this she  quite right diana prudently refrained  any further criticism but mr harrison  much harder  please first  told her there  entirely too much description   story “cut out all those flowery passages”  said unfeelingly anne had  uncomfortable conviction  mr harrison  right  she forced herself  expunge most  her beloved descriptions though  took three rewritings before  story could  pruned down  please  fastidious mr harrison “i’ve left out all  descriptions but  sunset” she said  last “i simply couldn’t let  go it   best  them all” “it hasn’t anything  do   story” said mr harrison “and you shouldn’t have laid  scene among rich city people what do you know  them why didn’t you lay  right here  avonleachanging  name  course or else mrs rachel lynde would probably think she   heroine” “oh  would never have done” protested anne “avonlea   dearest place   world but  isn’t quite romantic enough   scene   story” “i daresay there’s been many  romance  avonleaand many  tragedy too” said mr harrison drily “but your folks ain’t like real folks anywhere they talk too much  use too highflown language there’s one place where  dalrymple chap talks even   two pages  never lets  girl get  word  edgewise if he’d done   real life she’d have pitched him” “i don’t believe it” said anne flatly in her secret soul she thought   beautiful poetical things said  averil would win any girl’s heart completely besides   gruesome  hear  averil  stately queenlike averil “pitching” any one averil “declined her suitors” “anyhow” resumed  merciless mr harrison “i don’t see why maurice lennox didn’t get her he  twice  man  other is he did bad things but  did them perceval hadn’t time  anything but mooning” “mooning” that  even worse than “pitching” “maurice lennox   villain” said anne indignantly “i don’t see why every one likes him better than perceval” “perceval  too good he’s aggravating next time you write about  hero put  little spice  human nature  him” “averil couldn’t have married maurice he  bad” “she’d have reformed him you can reform  man you can’t reform  jellyfish  course your story isn’t badit’s kind  interesting i’ll admit but you’re too young  write  story  would  worth while wait ten years” anne made up her mind   next time she wrote  story she wouldn’t ask anybody  criticize it it  too discouraging she would not read  story  gilbert although she told him about it “if    success you’ll see  when   published gilbert but if    failure nobody shall ever see it” marilla knew nothing about  venture in imagination anne saw herself reading  story out   magazine  marilla entrapping her into praise  itfor  imagination all things  possibleand then triumphantly announcing herself  author one day anne took   post office  long bulky envelope addressed   delightful confidence  youth  inexperience   very biggest   “big” magazines diana   excited over   anne herself “how long do you suppose    before you hear  it” she asked “it shouldn’t  longer than  fortnight oh how happy  proud i shall  if   accepted” “of course    accepted  they  likely ask you  send them more you may   famous  mrs morgan some day anne  then how proud i’ll   knowing you” said diana who possessed  least  striking merit   unselfish admiration   gifts  graces  her friends a week  delightful dreaming followed  then came  bitter awakening one evening diana found anne   porch gable  suspiciouslooking eyes on  table lay  long envelope   crumpled manuscript “anne your story hasn’t come back” cried diana incredulously “yes  has” said anne shortly “well  editor must  crazy what reason did  give” “no reason  all there  just  printed slip saying   wasn’t found acceptable” “i never thought much   magazine anyway” said diana hotly “the stories    not half  interesting  those   canadian woman although  costs so much more i suppose  editor  prejudiced against any one who isn’t  yankee don’t  discouraged anne remember how mrs morgan’s stories came back send yours   canadian woman” “i believe i will” said anne plucking up heart “and if   published i’ll send  american editor  marked copy but i’ll cut  sunset out i believe mr harrison  right” out came  sunset but  spite  this heroic mutilation  editor   canadian woman sent averil’s atonement back so promptly   indignant diana declared   couldn’t have been read  all  vowed she  going  stop her subscription immediately anne took this second rejection   calmness  despair she locked  story away   garret trunk where  old story club tales reposed but first she yielded  diana’s entreaties  gave her  copy “this   end  my literary ambitions” she said bitterly she never mentioned  matter  mr harrison but one evening  asked her bluntly if her story had been accepted “no  editor wouldn’t take it” she answered briefly mr harrison looked sidewise   flushed delicate profile “well i suppose you’ll keep  writing them”  said encouragingly “no i shall never try  write  story again” declared anne   hopeless finality  nineteen when  door  shut   face “i wouldn’t give up altogether” said mr harrison reflectively “i’d write  story once   while but i wouldn’t pester editors  it i’d write  people  places like i knew  i’d make my characters talk everyday english  i’d let  sun rise  set   usual quiet way without much fuss over  fact if i had  have villains  all i’d give them  chance annei’d give them  chance there  some terrible bad men   world i suppose but you’d have  go  long piece  find themthough mrs lynde believes we’re all bad but most  us have got  little decency somewhere  us keep  writing anne” “no it  very foolish  me  attempt it when i’m through redmond i’ll stick  teaching i can teach i can’t write stories” “it’ll  time  you   getting  husband when you’re through redmond” said mr harrison “i don’t believe  putting marrying off too longlike i did” anne got up  marched home there  times when mr harrison  really intolerable “pitching” “mooning”  “getting  husband” ow chapter xiii the way  transgressors davy  dora

answered   defiant scowl mrs rachel sighed she had her suspicions about davy’s neck  ears but she knew  if she attempted  make  personal examination davy would likely take  his heels  she could not pursue him today “well  sure you behave yourselves” she warned them “don’t walk   dust don’t stop   porch  talk   other children don’t squirm or wriggle  your places don’t forget  golden text don’t lose your collection or forget  put  in don’t whisper  prayer time  don’t forget  pay attention   sermon” davy deigned no response he marched away down  lane followed   meek dora but his soul seethed

words don’t say them  sunday” pleaded dora davy   yet far  repentance but  his secret soul  felt that perhaps  had gone  little too far “i’m going  invent  swear word  my own”  declared “god  punish you if you do” said dora solemnly “then i think god   mean old scamp” retorted davy “doesn’t he know  fellow must have some way  ‘spressing his feelings” “davy” said dora she expected  davy would  struck down dead   spot but nothing happened “anyway i ain’t going  stand any more  mrs lynde’s bossing” spluttered davy “anne  marilla may have  right  boss me but she hasn’t i’m going  do every

weeks  rainless weather had made   road  marched along  it shuffling his feet viciously until   enveloped   hazy cloud “that’s  beginning”  announced triumphantly “and i’m going  stop   porch  talk

going to” cried dora blushing scarlet “well you didn’t slap him or seem  bit cross” retorted davy “i’ll tell her that too if you don’t come we’ll take  short cut up this field” “i’m afraid  those cows” protested poor dora seeing  prospect  escape “the very idea  your being scared  those cows” scoffed davy “why they’re both younger than you” “they’re bigger” said dora “they won’t hurt you come along now this  great when i grow up i ain’t going  bother going  church  all i believe i can get  heaven  myself” “you’ll go   other place if you break  sabbath day” said unhappy dora following him

pond bridge told  people  going home  church davy knew they must go he discarded tommy’s overalls resumed his own rightful attire  turned away  his string  trout   sigh no use  think  taking them home “well hadn’t we  splendid time”  demanded defiantly  they went down  hill field “i hadn’t” said dora flatly “and i don’t believe you hadreallyeither” she added   flash  insight   not   expected  her “i had so” cried davy but   voice  one who doth protest too much “no wonder you hadn’tjust sitting there like alike  mule” “i ain’t going to ‘sociate   cottons” said dora loftily “the cottons  all right” retorted davy “and they have far better times than we have they do just  they please  say just what they like before everybody i‘m going  do that too after this” “there  lots  things you wouldn’t dare say before everybody” averred dora “no there isn’t” “there is too would you” demanded dora gravely “would you say ‘tomcat’ before  minister” this   staggerer davy  not prepared  such  concrete example   freedom  speech but one did not have   consistent  dora “of course not”  admitted sulkily “‘tomcat’ isn’t  holy word i wouldn’t mention such  animal before  minister  all” “but if you had to” persisted dora “i’d call   thomas pussy” said davy “i think ‘gentleman cat’ would  more polite” reflected dora “you thinking” retorted davy  withering scorn davy  not feeling comfortable though  would have died before  admitted   dora now   exhilaration  truant delights had died away his conscience  beginning  give him salutary twinges after all perhaps  would have been better  have gone  sunday school  church mrs lynde might  bossy but there  always  box  cookies  her kitchen cupboard  she  not stingy at this inconvenient moment davy remembered  when  had torn his new school pants  week before mrs lynde had mended them beautifully  never said  word  marilla about them but davy’s cup  iniquity  not yet full he   discover  one sin demands another  cover it they had dinner  mrs lynde  day   first thing she asked davy was “were all your class  sunday school today” “yes’m” said davy   gulp “all  there‘cept one” “did you say your golden text  catechism” “yes’m” “did you put your collection in” “yes’m” “was mrs malcolm macpherson  church” “i don’t know” this  least   truth thought wretched davy “was  ladies’ aid announced  next week” “yes’m”quakingly “was prayermeeting” “ii don’t know” “you should know you should listen more attentively   announcements what  mr harvey’s text” davy took  frantic gulp  water  swallowed    last protest  conscience together he glibly recited  old golden text learned several weeks ago fortunately mrs lynde now stopped questioning him but davy did not enjoy his dinner he could only eat one helping  pudding “what’s  matter  you” demanded justly astonished mrs lynde “are you sick” “no” muttered davy “you look pale you’d better keep out   sun this afternoon” admonished mrs lynde “do you know how many lies you told mrs lynde” asked dora reproachfully  soon  they  alone after dinner davy goaded  desperation turned fiercely “i don’t know  i don’t care”  said “you just shut up dora keith” then poor davy betook himself   secluded retreat behind  woodpile  think over  way  transgressors green gables  wrapped  darkness  silence when anne reached home she lost no time going  bed  she  very tired  sleepy there had been several avonlea jollifications  preceding week involving rather late hours anne’s head  hardly  her pillow before she  half asleep but just then her door  softly opened   pleading voice said “anne” anne sat up drowsily “davy   you what   matter” a whiteclad figure flung itself across  floor     bed “anne” sobbed davy getting his arms about her neck “i’m awful glad you’re home i couldn’t go  sleep till i’d told somebody” “told somebody what” “how mis’rubul i am” “why  you miserable dear” “‘cause i  so bad today anne oh i  awful badbadder’n i’ve ever been yet” “what did you do” “oh i’m afraid  tell you you’ll never like me again anne i couldn’t say my prayers tonight i couldn’t tell god what i’d done i  ‘shamed  have him know” “but he knew anyway davy” “that’s what dora said but i thought p’raps he mightn’t have noticed just   time anyway i’d rather tell you first” “what   you did” out  all came   rush “i run away  sunday schooland went fishing   cottonsand i told ever so many whoppers  mrs lyndeoh ‘most half  dozenandandii said  swear word annea pretty near swear word anyhowand i called god names” there  silence davy didn’t know what  make  it was anne so shocked  she never would speak  him again “anne what  you going  do  me”  whispered “nothing dear you’ve been punished already i think” “no i haven’t nothing’s been done  me” “you’ve been very unhappy ever since you did wrong haven’t you” “you bet” said davy emphatically “that  your conscience punishing you davy” “what’s my conscience i want  know” “it’s something  you davy  always tells you when you  doing wrong  makes you unhappy if you persist  doing it haven’t you noticed that” “yes but i didn’t know what  was i wish i didn’t have it i’d have lots more fun where  my conscience anne i want  know is   my stomach” “no it’s  your soul” answered anne thankful   darkness since gravity must  preserved  serious matters “i s’pose i can’t get clear   then” said davy   sigh “are you going  tell marilla  mrs lynde  me anne” “no dear i’m not going  tell any one you  sorry you  naughty aren’t you” “you bet” “and you’ll never  bad like  again” “no but” added davy cautiously “i might  bad some other way” “you won’t say naughty words or run away  sundays or tell falsehoods  cover up your sins” “no it doesn’t pay” said davy “well davy just tell god you  sorry  ask him  forgive you” “have you forgiven me anne” “yes dear” “then” said davy joyously “i don’t care much whether god does or not” “davy” “ohi’ll ask himi’ll ask him” said davy quickly scrambling off  bed convinced  anne’s tone   must have said something dreadful “i don’t mind asking him anneplease god i’m awful sorry i behaved bad today  i’ll try   good  sundays always  please forgive methere now anne” “well now run off  bed like  good boy” “all right say i don’t feel mis’rubul any more i feel fine good night” “good night” anne slipped down  her pillows   sigh  relief ohhow sleepyshe was in another second “anne” davy  back again  her bed anne dragged her eyes open “what   now dear” she asked trying  keep  note  impatience out  her voice “anne have you ever noticed how mr harrison spits do you s’pose if i practice hard i can learn  spit just like him” anne sat up “davy keith” she said “go straight  your bed  don’t let me catch you out   again tonight go now” davy went  stood not upon  order  his going chapter xiv the summons anne  sitting  ruby gillis   gillis’ garden after  day had crept lingeringly through    gone it had been  warm smoky summer afternoon the world    splendor  outflowering the idle valleys  full  hazes the woodways  pranked  shadows   fields   purple   asters anne had given up  moonlight drive   white sands beach  she might spend  evening  ruby she had so spent many evenings  summer although she often wondered what good  did any one  sometimes went home deciding  she could not go again ruby grew paler   summer waned  white sands school  given up“her father thought  better  she shouldn’t teach till new year’s”and  fancy work she loved oftener  oftener fell  hands grown too weary  it but she  always gay always hopeful always chattering  whispering  her beaux  their rivalries  despairs it  this  made anne’s visits hard  her what had once been silly or amusing  gruesome now   death peering through  wilful mask  life yet ruby seemed  cling  her  never let her go until she had promised  come again soon mrs lynde grumbled about anne’s frequent visits  declared she would catch consumption even marilla  dubious “every time you go  see ruby you come home looking tired out” she said “it’s so very sad  dreadful” said anne   low tone “ruby doesn’t seem  realize her condition   least and yet i somehow feel she needs helpcraves itand i want  give   her  can’t all  time i’m  her i feel  if i  watching her struggle   invisible foetrying  push  back  such feeble resistance  she has that  why i come home tired” but tonight anne did not feel this so keenly ruby  strangely quiet she said not  word about parties  drives  dresses  “fellows” she lay   hammock  her untouched work beside her   white shawl wrapped about her thin shoulders her long yellow braids  hairhow anne had envied those beautiful braids  old schooldayslay  either side  her she had taken  pins outthey made her head ache she said the hectic flush  gone   time leaving her pale  childlike the moon rose   silvery sky empearling  clouds around her below  pond shimmered   hazy radiance just beyond  gillis homestead   church   old graveyard beside it the moonlight shone   white stones bringing them out  clearcut relief against  dark trees behind “how strange  graveyard looks  moonlight” said ruby suddenly “how ghostly” she shuddered “anne  won’t  long now before i’ll  lying over there you  diana  all  rest   going about full  lifeand i’ll  therein  old graveyarddead” the surprise   bewildered anne for  few moments she could not speak “you know it’s so don’t you” said ruby insistently “yes i know” answered anne   low tone “dear ruby i know” “everybody knows it” said ruby bitterly “i know iti’ve known  all summer though i wouldn’t give in and oh anne”she reached out  caught anne’s hand pleadingly impulsively“i don’t want  die i’m afraid  die” “why should you  afraid ruby” asked anne quietly “becausebecauseoh i’m not afraid but  i’ll go  heaven anne i’m  church member butit’ll  all so different i thinkand thinkand i get so frightenedandandhomesick heaven must  very beautiful  course  bible says sobut anne it won’t be what i’ve been used to” through anne’s mind drifted  intrusive recollection   funny story she had heard philippa gordon tellthe story  some old man who had said very much  same thing about  world  come it had sounded funny thenshe remembered how she  priscilla had laughed over it but  did not seem   least humorous now coming  ruby’s pale trembling lips it  sad tragicand true heaven could not  what ruby had been used to there had been nothing  her gay frivolous life her shallow ideals  aspirations  fit her   great change or make  life  come seem  her anything but alien  unreal  undesirable anne wondered helplessly what she could say  would help her could she say anything “i think ruby” she began hesitatinglyfor   difficult  anne  speak  any one   deepest thoughts  her heart or  new ideas  had vaguely begun  shape themselves  her mind concerning  great mysteries  life here  hereafter superseding her old childish conceptions    hardest  all  speak  them  such  ruby gillis“i think perhaps we have very mistaken ideas about heavenwhat    what  holds  us i don’t think  can  so very different  life here  most people seem  think i believe we’ll just go  living  good deal  we live hereand  ourselves just  sameonly    easier   good  tofollow  highest all  hindrances  perplexities   taken away  we shall see clearly don’t  afraid ruby” “i can’t help it” said ruby pitifully “even if what you say about heaven  trueand you can’t  sureit may  only  imagination  yoursit won’t  just  same it can’t be i want  go  living here i’m so young anne i haven’t had my life i’ve fought so hard  liveand  isn’t any usei have  dieand leave everything i care for” anne sat   pain   almost intolerable she could not tell comforting falsehoods  all  ruby said  so horribly true she was leaving everything she cared for she had laid up her treasures  earth only she had lived solely   little things  lifethe things  passforgetting  great things  go onward into eternity bridging  gulf between  two lives  making  death  mere passing  one dwelling   otherfrom twilight  unclouded day god would take care  her thereanne believedshe would learnbut now   no wonder her soul clung  blind helplessness   only things she knew  loved ruby raised herself  her arm  lifted up her bright beautiful blue eyes   moonlit skies “i want  live” she said   trembling voice “i want  live like other girls ii want   married anneandandhave little children you know i always loved babies anne i couldn’t say this  any one but you i know you understand and then poor herbhehe loves me  i love him anne the others meant nothing  me but he doesand if i could live i would  his wife   so happy oh anne it’s hard” ruby sank back  her pillows  sobbed convulsively anne pressed her hand   agony  sympathysilent sympathy which perhaps helped ruby more than broken imperfect words could have done  presently she grew calmer  her sobs ceased “i’m glad i’ve told you this anne” she whispered “it  helped me just  say  all out i’ve wanted  all summerevery time you came i wanted  talk  over  youbut i couldn’t it seemed  if  would make death so sure if i said i  going  die or if any one else said  or hinted it i wouldn’t say it or even think it in  daytime when people  around me  everything  cheerful  wasn’t so hard  keep  thinking  it but   night when i couldn’t sleepit  so dreadful anne i couldn’t get away   then death just came  stared me   face until i got so frightened i could have screamed “but you won’t  frightened any more ruby  you you’ll  brave  believe  all  going   well  you” “i’ll try i’ll think over what you have said  try  believe it and you’ll come up  often  you can won’t you anne” “yes dear” “itit won’t  very long now anne i feel sure  that and i’d rather have you than any one else i always liked you best  all  girls i went  school with you  never jealous or mean like some  them were poor em white  up  see me yesterday you remember em  i  such chums  three years when we went  school and then we quarrelled  time   school concert we’ve never spoken  each other since wasn’t  silly anything like  seems silly now but em  i made up  old quarrel yesterday she said she’d have spoken years ago only she thought i wouldn’t and i never spoke  her because i  sure she wouldn’t speak  me isn’t  strange how people misunderstand each other anne” “most   trouble  life comes  misunderstanding i think” said anne “i must go now ruby it’s getting lateand you shouldn’t  out   damp” “you’ll come up soon again” “yes very soon and if there’s anything i can do  help you i’ll  so glad” “i know you have helped me already nothing seems quite so dreadful now good night anne” “good night dear” anne walked home very slowly   moonlight the evening had changed something  her life held  different meaning  deeper purpose on  surface  would go  just  same but  deeps had been stirred it must not   her   poor butterfly ruby when she came   end  one life  must not   face  next   shrinking terror  something wholly differentsomething  which accustomed thought  ideal  aspiration had unfitted her the little things  life sweet  excellent  their place must not   things lived for  highest must  sought  followed  life  heaven must  begun here  earth that good night   garden   all time anne never saw ruby  life again the next night  avis gave  farewell party  jane andrews before her departure   west and while light feet danced  bright eyes laughed  merry tongues chattered there came  summons   soul  avonlea  might not  disregarded or evaded the next morning  word went  house  house  ruby gillis  dead she had died  her sleep painlessly  calmly   her face   smileas if after all death had come   kindly friend  lead her over  threshold instead   grisly phantom she had dreaded mrs rachel lynde said emphatically after  funeral  ruby gillis   handsomest corpse she ever laid eyes on her loveliness  she lay whiteclad among  delicate flowers  anne had placed about her  remembered  talked   years  avonlea ruby had always been beautiful but her beauty had been   earth earthy  had had  certain insolent quality  it  if  flaunted itself   beholder’s eye spirit had never shone through it intellect had never refined it but death had touched   consecrated it bringing out delicate modelings  purity  outline never seen beforedoing what life  love  great sorrow  deep womanhood joys might have done  ruby anne looking down through  mist  tears  her old playfellow thought she saw  face god had meant ruby  have  remembered  so always mrs gillis called anne aside into  vacant room before  funeral procession left  house  gave her  small packet “i want you  have this” she sobbed “ruby would have liked you  have it it’s  embroidered centerpiece she  working at it isn’t quite finishedthe needle  sticking   just where her poor little fingers put   last time she laid  down  afternoon before she died” “there’s always  piece  unfinished work left” said mrs lynde  tears  her eyes “but i suppose there’s always some one  finish it” “how difficult    realize  one we have always known can really  dead” said anne  she  diana walked home “ruby   first  our schoolmates  go one  one sooner or later all  rest  us must follow” “yes i suppose so” said diana uncomfortably she did not want  talk  that she would have preferred  have discussed  details   funeralthe splendid white velvet casket mr gillis had insisted  having  ruby“the gillises must always make  splurge even  funerals” quoth mrs rachel lyndeherb spencer’s sad face  uncontrolled hysteric grief  one  ruby’s sistersbut anne would not talk  these things she seemed wrapped   reverie  which diana felt lonesomely  she had neither lot nor part “ruby gillis   great girl  laugh” said davy suddenly “will she laugh  much  heaven  she did  avonlea anne i want  know” “yes i think she will” said anne “oh anne” protested diana   rather shocked smile “well why not diana” asked anne seriously “do you think we’ll never laugh  heaven” “ohii don’t know” floundered diana “it doesn’t seem just right somehow you know it’s rather dreadful  laugh  church” “but heaven won’t  like churchall  time” said anne “i hope  ain’t” said davy emphatically “if   i don’t want  go church  awful dull anyway i don’t mean  go  ever so long i mean  live    hundred years old like mr thomas blewett  white sands he says he’s lived so long ‘cause  always smoked tobacco   killed all  germs can i smoke tobacco pretty soon anne” “no davy i hope you’ll never use tobacco” said anne absently “what’ll you feel like if  germs kill me then” demanded davy chapter xv a dream turned upside down “just one more week  we go back  redmond” said anne she  happy   thought  returning  work classes  redmond friends pleasing visions  also being woven around patty’s place there   warm pleasant sense  home   thought  it even though she had never lived there but  summer had been  very happy one tooa time  glad living  summer suns  skies  time  keen delight  wholesome things  time  renewing  deepening  old friendships  time  which she had learned  live more nobly  work more patiently  play more heartily “all life lessons  not learned  college” she thought “life teaches them everywhere” but alas  final week   pleasant vacation  spoiled  anne  one  those impish happenings which  like  dream turned upside down “been writing any more stories lately” inquired mr harrison genially one evening when anne  taking tea  him  mrs harrison “no” answered anne rather crisply “well no offense meant mrs hiram sloane told me  other day   big envelope addressed   rollings reliable baking powder company  montreal had been dropped into  post office box  month ago  she suspicioned  somebody  trying   prize they’d offered   best story  introduced  name  their baking powder she said  wasn’t addressed  your writing but i thought maybe   you” “indeed no i saw  prize offer but i’d never dream  competing  it i think  would  perfectly disgraceful  write  story  advertise  baking powder it would  almost  bad  judson parker’s patent medicine fence” so spake anne loftily little dreaming   valley  humiliation awaiting her that very evening diana popped into  porch gable brighteyed  rosy cheeked carrying  letter “oh anne here’s  letter  you i    office so i thought i’d bring  along do open  quick if   what i believe   i shall just  wild  delight” anne puzzled opened  letter  glanced over  typewritten contents miss anne shirley green gables avonlea pe island “dear madam we have much pleasure  informing you  your charming story ‘averil’s atonement’  won  prize  twentyfive dollars offered  our recent

 prizei  sure  it i sent your story into  competition anne” “dianabarry” “yes i did” said diana gleefully perching herself   bed “when i saw  offer i thought  your story   minute   first i thought i’d ask you  send  in but then i  afraid you wouldn’tyou had so little faith left  it so i just decided i’d send  copy you gave me  say nothing about it then if  didn’t win  prize you’d never know  you wouldn’t feel badly over it because  stories  failed  not   returned  if  did you’d have such  delightful surprise” diana  not  most discerning  mortals but just  this moment  struck her  anne  not looking exactly overjoyed the surprise  there beyond doubtbut where   delight “why anne you don’t seem  bit pleased” she exclaimed anne instantly manufactured  smile  put  on “of course i couldn’t  anything but pleased over your unselfish wish  give me pleasure” she said slowly “but you knowi’m so amazedi can’t realize itand i don’t understand there wasn’t  word  my story aboutabout” anne choked  little over  word“baking powder” “oh i put  in” said diana reassured “it   easy  winkand  course my experience  our old story club helped me you know  scene where averil makes  cake well i just stated  she used  rollings reliable  it    why  turned out so well  then   last paragraph where perceval clasps averil  his arms  says ‘sweetheart  beautiful coming years  bring us  fulfilment  our home  dreams’ i added ‘in which we  never use any baking powder except rollings reliable’” “oh” gasped poor anne  if some one had dashed cold water  her “and you’ve won  twentyfive dollars” continued diana jubilantly “why i heard priscilla say once   canadian woman only pays five dollars   story” anne held out  hateful pink slip  shaking fingers “i can’t take itit’s yours  right diana you sent  story   made  alterations ii would certainly never have sent it so you must take  check” “i’d like  see myself” said diana scornfully “why what i did wasn’t any trouble the honor  being  friend   prizewinner  enough  me well i must go i should have gone straight home   post office  we have company but i simply had  come  hear  news i’m so glad  your sake anne” anne suddenly bent forward put her arms about diana  kissed her cheek “i think you   sweetest  truest friend   world diana” she said   little tremble  her voice “and i assure you i appreciate  motive  what you’ve done” diana pleased  embarrassed got herself away  poor anne after flinging  innocent check into her bureau drawer  if   bloodmoney cast herself  her bed  wept tears  shame  outraged sensibility oh she could

must confess i can’t what  wrong” “everything” moaned anne “i feel  if i  disgraced forever what do you think  mother would feel like if she found her child tattooed over   baking powder advertisement i feel just  same i loved my poor little story  i wrote  out   best    me and   sacrilege  have  degraded   level   baking powder advertisement don’t you remember what professor hamilton used  tell us

unworthy about that or anything ridiculous either one would rather write masterpieces  literature no doubtbut meanwhile board  tuition fees have   paid” this commonsense matteroffact view   case

resumed her walk  followed anne resigned herself  his company until she reached  gate  patty’s place which she coldly shut  his face fondly supposing she had seen  last  him but when fifteen minutes later phil opened  door there sat  rustybrown cat   step more  promptly darted   sprang upon anne’s lap   halfpleading halftriumphant “miaow” “anne” said stella severely “do you own  animal” “no i do not” protested disgusted anne “the creature followed me home  somewhere i couldn’t get rid  him ugh get down i like decent cats reasonably well but i don’t like beasties  your complexion” pussy however refused  get down he coolly curled up  anne’s lap  began  purr “he  evidently adopted you” laughed priscilla “i won’t be adopted” said anne stubbornly “the poor creature  starving” said phil pityingly “why his bones  almost coming through his skin” “well i’ll give him  square meal  then  must return  whence  came” said anne resolutely the cat  fed  put out in  morning   still   doorstep on  doorstep  continued  sit bolting  whenever  door  opened no coolness  welcome had  least effect  him  nobody save anne did  take  least notice out  compassion  girls fed him but when  week had passed they decided  something must  done the cat’s appearance had improved his eye  cheek had resumed their normal appearance   not quite so thin   had been seen washing his face “but  all  we can’t keep him” said stella “aunt jimsie  coming next week  she  bring  sarahcat  her we can’t keep two cats  if we did this rusty coat would fight all  time   sarahcat he’s  fighter  nature he had  pitched battle last evening   tobaccoking’s cat  routed him horse foot  artillery” “we must get rid  him” agreed anne looking darkly   subject  their discussion who  purring   hearth rug   air  lamblike meekness “but  question ishow how can four unprotected females get rid   cat who won’t  got rid of” “we must chloroform him” said phil briskly “that   most humane way” “who  us knows anything about chloroforming  cat” demanded anne gloomily “i do honey it’s one  my fewsadly fewuseful accomplishments i’ve disposed  several  home you take  cat   morning  give him  good breakfast then you take  old burlap bagthere’s one   back porchput  cat    turn over him  wooden box then take  twoounce bottle  chloroform uncork it  slip  under  edge   box put  heavy weight  top   box  leave  till evening the cat   dead curled up peacefully  if   asleep no painno struggle” “it sounds easy” said anne dubiously “it is easy just leave   me i’ll see  it” said phil reassuringly accordingly  chloroform  procured   next morning rusty  lured  his doom he ate his breakfast licked his chops  climbed into anne’s lap anne’s heart misgave her this poor creature loved hertrusted her how could she   party  this destruction “here take him” she said hastily  phil “i feel like  murderess” “he won’t suffer you know” comforted phil but anne had fled the fatal deed  done   back porch nobody went near   day but  dusk phil declared  rusty must  buried “pris  stella must dig his grave   orchard” declared phil “and anne must come  me  lift  box off that’s  part i always hate” the two conspirators tiptoed reluctantly   back porch phil gingerly lifted  stone she had put   box suddenly faint but distinct sounded  unmistakable mew under  box “hehe isn’t dead” gasped anne sitting blankly down   kitchen doorstep “he must be” said phil incredulously another tiny mew proved   wasn’t the two girls stared  each other “what  we do” questioned anne “why   world don’t you come” demanded stella appearing   doorway “we’ve got  grave ready ‘what silent still  silent all’” she quoted teasingly “‘oh no  voices   dead sound like  distant torrent’s fall’” promptly counterquoted anne pointing solemnly   box a burst  laughter broke  tension “we must leave him here till morning” said phil replacing  stone “he hasn’t mewed  five minutes perhaps  mews we heard  his dying groan or perhaps we merely imagined them under  strain  our guilty consciences” but when  box  lifted   morning rusty bounded  one gay leap  anne’s shoulder where  began  lick her face affectionately never  there  cat more decidedly alive “here’s  knot hole   box” groaned phil “i never saw it that’s why  didn’t die now we’ve got  do  all over again” “no we haven’t” declared anne suddenly “rusty isn’t going   killed again he’s my catand you’ve just got  make  best  it” “oh well if you’ll settle  aunt jimsie   sarahcat” said stella   air  one washing her hands   whole affair from  time rusty  one   family he slept o’nights   scrubbing cushion   back porch  lived   fat   land by  time aunt jamesina came   plump  glossy  tolerably respectable but like kipling’s cat  “walked  himself” his paw  against every cat  every cat’s paw against him one  one  vanquished  aristocratic felines  spofford avenue as  human beings  loved anne  anne alone nobody else even dared stroke him an angry spit  something  sounded much like very improper language greeted any one who did “the airs  cat puts   perfectly intolerable” declared stella “him   nice old pussens him was” vowed anne cuddling her pet defiantly “well i don’t know how    sarahcat  ever make out  live together” said stella pesimistically “catfights   orchard o’nights  bad enough but catfights here   livingroom  unthinkable” in due time aunt jamesina arrived anne  priscilla  phil had awaited her advent rather dubiously but when aunt jamesina  enthroned   rocking chair before  open fire they figuratively bowed down  worshipped her aunt jamesina   tiny old woman   little softlytriangular face  large soft blue eyes   alight  unquenchable youth   full  hopes   girl’s she had pink cheeks  snowwhite hair which she wore  quaint little puffs over her ears “it’s  very oldfashioned way” she said knitting industriously  something  dainty  pink   sunset cloud “but i am oldfashioned my clothes are   stands  reason my opinions are too i don’t say they’re any  better  that mind you in fact i daresay they’re  good deal  worse but they’ve worn nice  easy new shoes  smarter than old ones but  old ones  more comfortable i’m old enough  indulge myself   matter  shoes  opinions i mean  take  real easy here i know you expect me  look after you  keep you proper but i’m not going  do it you’re old enough  know how  behave if you’re ever going  be so  far  i am concerned” concluded aunt jamesina   twinkle  her young eyes “you can all go  destruction  your own way” “oh  somebody separate those cats” pleaded stella shudderingly aunt jamesina had brought  her not only  sarahcat but joseph joseph she explained had belonged   dear friend  hers who had gone  live  vancouver “she couldn’t take joseph  her so she begged me  take him i really couldn’t refuse he’s  beautiful catthat is his disposition  beautiful she called him joseph because his coat   many colors” it certainly was joseph   disgusted stella said looked like  walking ragbag it  impossible  say what his ground color was his legs  white  black spots  them his back  gray   huge patch  yellow  one side   black patch   other his tail  yellow   gray tip one ear  black  one yellow a black patch over one eye gave him  fearfully rakish look in reality   meek  inoffensive   sociable disposition in one respect if  no other joseph  like  lily   field he toiled not neither did  spin or catch mice yet solomon  all his glory slept not  softer cushions or feasted more fully  fat things joseph   sarahcat arrived  express  separate boxes after they had been released  fed joseph selected  cushion  corner which appealed  him   sarahcat gravely sat herself down before  fire  proceeded  wash her face she   large sleek grayandwhite cat   enormous dignity which  not  all impaired  any consciousness  her plebian origin she had been given  aunt jamesina  her washerwoman “her name  sarah so my husband always called puss  sarahcat” explained aunt jamesina “she  eight years old   remarkable mouser don’t worry stella the sarahcat never fights  joseph rarely” “they’ll have  fight here  selfdefense” said stella at this juncture rusty arrived   scene he bounded joyously half way across  room before  saw  intruders then  stopped short his tail expanded until    big  three tails the fur  his back rose up   defiant arch rusty lowered his head uttered  fearful shriek  hatred  defiance  launched himself   sarahcat the stately animal had stopped washing her face   looking  him curiously she met his onslaught  one contemptuous sweep  her capable paw rusty went rolling helplessly over   rug  picked himself up dazedly what sort   cat  this who had boxed his ears he looked dubiously   sarahcat would  or would  not the sarahcat deliberately turned her back  him  resumed her toilet operations rusty decided   would not he never did from  time   sarahcat ruled  roost rusty never again interfered  her but joseph rashly sat up  yawned rusty burning  avenge his disgrace swooped down upon him joseph pacific  nature could fight upon occasion  fight well the result   series  drawn battles every day rusty  joseph fought  sight anne took rusty’s part  detested joseph stella   despair but aunt jamesina only laughed “let them fight  out” she said tolerantly “they’ll make friends after  bit joseph needs some exercisehe  getting too fat and rusty   learn  isn’t  only cat   world” eventually joseph  rusty accepted  situation   sworn enemies became sworn friends they slept   same cushion  their paws about each other  gravely washed each other’s faces “we’ve all got used  each other” said phil “and i’ve learned how  wash dishes  sweep  floor” “but you needn’t try  make us believe you can chloroform  cat” laughed anne “it  all  fault   knothole” protested phil “it   good thing  knothole  there” said aunt jamesina rather severely “kittens have   drowned i admit or  world would  overrun but no decent grownup cat should  done  deathunless  sucks eggs” “you wouldn’t have thought rusty very decent if you’d seen him when  came here” said stella “he positively looked like  old nick” “i don’t believe old nick can  so very ugly” said aunt jamesina reflectively “he wouldn’t do so much harm if  was i always think  him   rather handsome gentleman” chapter xvii a letter  davy “it’s beginning  snow girls” said phil coming  one november evening “and

 marketing it’s better fun than flirting” concluded phil gravely “everything  going up scandalously” sighed stella “never mind thank goodness air  salvation  still free” said aunt jamesina “and so  laughter” added anne “there’s no tax   yet    well because you’re all going  laugh presently i’m going  read you davy’s letter his spelling  improved immensely this past year though   not strong

earn enough   summer vacation “i suppose i’ll just have  drop out next year” she thought drearily “and teach  district school again until i earn enough  finish my course and   time all my old class  have graduated  patty’s place   out   question but there i’m not going    coward i’m thankful i can earn my way through if necessary” “here’s mr harrison wading up  lane” announced davy running out “i hope he’s brought  mail it’s three days since we got it i want  see what them pesky grits  doing i’m  conservative anne and i tell you you have  keep your eye  them grits” mr harrison had brought  mail  merry letters  stella  priscilla  phil soon dissipated anne’s blues aunt jamesina too had written saying  she  keeping  hearthfire alight    cats  all well   house plants doing fine “the weather  been real cold” she wrote “so i let  cats sleep   houserusty  joseph   sofa   livingroom   sarahcat   foot  my bed it’s real company  hear her purring when i wake up   night  think  my poor daughter

but  snakes i can’t think why providence ever made them sometimes i don’t think he did i’m inclined  believe  old harry had  hand  making them” anne had left  thin typewritten communication till  last thinking  unimportant when she had read  she sat very still  tears  her eyes “what   matter anne” asked marilla “miss josephine barry  dead” said anne   low tone “so she  gone  last” said marilla “well she  been sick  over  year   barrys have been expecting  hear  her death any time it  well she   rest  she  suffered dreadfully anne she  always kind  you” “she  been kind   last marilla this letter   her lawyer she  left me  thousand dollars  her will” “gracious ain’t   awful lot  money” exclaimed davy “she’s  woman you  diana lit  when you jumped into  spare room bed ain’t she diana told me  story is  why she left you so much” “hush davy” said anne gently she slipped away   porch gable   full heart leaving marilla  mrs lynde  talk over  news  their hearts’ content “do you s’pose anne  ever get married now” speculated davy anxiously “when dorcas sloane got married last summer she said if she’d had enough money  live  she’d never have been bothered   man but even  widower  eight children  better’n living   sisterinlaw” “davy keith do hold your tongue” said mrs rachel severely “the way you talk  scandalous   small boy that’s what” chapter xix an interlude “to think  this  my twentieth birthday   i’ve left my teens behind me forever” said anne who  curled up   hearthrug  rusty  her lap  aunt jamesina who  reading  her pet chair they  alone   living room stella  priscilla had gone   committee meeting  phil  upstairs adorning herself   party “i suppose you feel kind of sorry” said aunt jamesina “the teens  such  nice part  life i’m glad i’ve never gone out  them myself” anne laughed “you never will aunty you’ll  eighteen when you should   hundred yes i’m sorry   little dissatisfied  well miss stacy told me long ago    time i  twenty my character would  formed  good or evil i don’t feel  it’s what  should be it’s full  flaws” “so’s everybody’s” said aunt jamesina cheerfully “mine’s cracked   hundred places your miss stacy likely meant  when you  twenty your character would have got  permanent bent  one direction or ‘tother  would go  developing   line don’t worry over it anne do your duty  god  your neighbor  yourself  have  good time that’s my philosophy  it’s always worked pretty well where’s phil off  tonight” “she’s going   dance  she’s got  sweetest dress  itcreamy yellow silk  cobwebby lace it just suits those brown tints  hers” “there’s magic   words ‘silk’  ‘lace’ isn’t there” said aunt jamesina “the very sound  them makes me feel like skipping off   dance and yellow silk it makes one think   dress  sunshine i always wanted  yellow silk dress but first my mother  then my husband wouldn’t hear  it the very first thing i’m going  do when i get  heaven   get  yellow silk dress” amid anne’s peal  laughter phil came downstairs trailing clouds  glory  surveyed herself   long oval mirror   wall “a flattering looking glass   promoter  amiability” she said “the one  my room does certainly make me green do i look pretty nice anne” “do you really know how pretty you are phil” asked anne  honest admiration “of course i do what  looking glasses  men for that wasn’t what i meant are all my ends tucked in is my skirt straight and would this rose look better lower down i’m afraid it’s too highit  make me look lopsided but i hate things tickling my ears” “everything  just right   southwest dimple  yours  lovely” “anne there’s one thing  particular i like about youyou’re so ungrudging there isn’t  particle  envy  you” “why should she  envious” demanded aunt jamesina “she’s not quite  goodlooking  you maybe but she’s got  far handsomer nose” “i know it” conceded phil “my nose always  been  great comfort  me” confessed anne “and i love  way your hair grows  your forehead anne and  one wee curl always looking  if   going  drop but never dropping  delicious but   noses mine   dreadful worry  me i know   time i’m forty    byrney what do you think i’ll look like when i’m forty anne” “like  old matronly married woman” teased anne “i won’t” said phil sitting down comfortably  wait  her escort “joseph you calico beastie don’t you dare jump  my lap i won’t go   dance all over cat hairs no anne i won’t look matronly but no doubt i’ll  married” “to alec or alonzo” asked anne “to one  them i suppose” sighed phil “if i can ever decide which” “it shouldn’t  hard  decide” scolded aunt jamesina “i  born  seesaw aunty  nothing can ever prevent me  teetering” “you ought   more levelheaded philippa” “it’s best   levelheaded  course” agreed philippa “but you miss lots  fun as  alec  alonzo if you knew them you’d understand why it’s difficult  choose between them they’re equally nice” “then take somebody who  nicer” suggested aunt jamesina “there’s  senior who  so devoted  youwill leslie he  such nice large mild eyes” “they’re  little bit too large  too mildlike  cow’s” said phil cruelly “what do you say about george parker” “there’s nothing  say about him except   always looks  if  had just been starched  ironed” “marr holworthy then you can’t find  fault  him” “no  would do if  wasn’t poor i must marry  rich man aunt jamesina thatand good looksis  indispensable qualification i’d marry gilbert blythe if   rich” “oh would you” said anne rather viciously “we don’t like  idea  little bit although we don’t want gilbert ourselves oh no” mocked phil “but don’t let’s talk  disagreeable subjects i’ll have  marry sometime i suppose but i shall put off  evil day  long  i can” “you mustn’t marry anybody you don’t love phil when all’s said  done” said aunt jamesina “‘oh hearts  loved   good old way have been out o’  fashion this many  day’” trilled phil mockingly “there’s  carriage i flybibi you two oldfashioned darlings” when phil had gone aunt jamesina looked solemnly  anne “that girl  pretty  sweet  goodhearted but do you think she  quite right  her mind  spells anne” “oh i don’t think there’s anything  matter  phil’s mind” said anne hiding  smile “it’s just her way  talking” aunt jamesina shook her head “well i hope so anne i do hope so because i love her but i can’t understand hershe beats me she isn’t like any   girls i ever knew or any   girls i  myself” “how many girls  you aunt jimsie” “about half  dozen my dear” chapter xx gilbert speaks “this  been  dull prosy day” yawned phil stretching herself idly   sofa having previously dispossessed

beside her   boulder  held out his mayflowers “don’t these remind you  home  our old schoolday picnics anne” anne took them  buried her face  them “i’m  mr silas sloane’s barrens this very minute” she said rapturously “i suppose you   there  reality   few days” “no not   fortnight i’m going  visit  phil  bolingbroke before i go home you’ll   avonlea before i will” “no i shall not   avonlea  all this summer anne i’ve been offered  job   daily news office  i’m going  take it” “oh” said anne vaguely she wondered what  whole avonlea summer would  like without gilbert somehow she did not like  prospect “well” she concluded flatly “it   good thing  you  course” “yes i’ve been hoping i would get it it  help me out next year” “you mustn’t work too hard” said anne without any very clear idea  what she  saying she wished desperately  phil would come out “you’ve studied very constantly this winter isn’t this  delightful evening do you know i found  cluster  white violets under  old twisted tree over there today i felt  if i had discovered  gold mine” “you  always discovering gold mines” said gilbertalso absently “let us go  see if we can find some more” suggested anne eagerly “i’ll call phil and” “never mind phil   violets just now anne” said gilbert quietly taking her hand   clasp  which she could not free it “there  something i want  say  you” “oh don’t say it” cried anne pleadingly “don’tplease gilbert” “i must things can’t go  like this any longer anne i love you you know i do ii can’t tell you how much will you promise me  some day you’ll  my wife” “ii can’t” said anne miserably “oh gilbertyouyou’ve spoiled everything” “don’t you care  me  all” gilbert asked after  very dreadful pause during which anne had not dared  look up “notnot   way i do care  great deal  you   friend but i don’t love you gilbert” “but can’t you give me some hope  you willyet” “no i can’t” exclaimed anne desperately “i never never can love youin  waygilbert you must never speak  this

proposals  either grotesque orhorrible could she ever forget gilbert’s face “is there anybody else”  asked  last   low voice “nono” said anne eagerly “i don’t care  any one like thatand i like you better than anybody else   world gilbert and we mustwe must go  being friends gilbert” gilbert gave  bitter little laugh “friends your friendship can’t satisfy me anne i want your loveand you tell me i can never have that” “i’m sorry forgive me gilbert”  all anne could say where oh where  all  gracious  graceful speeches wherewith  imagination she had been wont  dismiss rejected suitors gilbert released her hand gently “there isn’t anything  forgive there have been times when i thought you did care i’ve deceived myself that’s all goodbye anne” anne got herself  her room sat down  her window seat behind  pines  cried bitterly she felt  if something incalculably precious had gone out  her life it  gilbert’s friendship  course oh why must she lose  after this fashion “what   matter honey” asked phil coming  through  moonlit gloom anne did not answer at  moment she wished phil   thousand miles away “i suppose you’ve gone  refused gilbert blythe you   idiot anne shirley” “do you call  idiotic  refuse  marry  man i don’t love” said anne coldly goaded  reply “you don’t know love when you see it you’ve tricked something out  your imagination  you think love  you expect  real thing  look like that there that’s  first sensible thing i’ve ever said  my life i wonder how i managed it” “phil” pleaded anne “please go away  leave me alone   little while my world  tumbled into pieces i want  reconstruct it” “without any gilbert  it” said phil going a world without any gilbert  it anne repeated  words drearily would  not   very lonely forlorn place well   all gilbert’s fault he had

“haven’t you sense enough  distinguish between  fairytale   falsehood” “then what    sasses back   boulter bush i want  know” insisted davy “when you   little older davy i’ll explain  all  you” the

silvery sounds which you could hear if you hearkened  much  your soul  your ears the girls wandered down  long pineland aisle  seemed  lead right out into  heart   deepred overflowing winter sunset “i’d go home  write  poem this blessed minute if i only knew how” declared phil pausing   open space where  rosy light  staining  green tips   pines “it’s all so wonderful herethis great white stillness  those dark trees  always seem   thinking” “‘the woods  god’s first temples’” quoted anne softly “one can’t help feeling reverent  adoring  such  place i always feel so near him when i walk among  pines” “anne i’m  happiest girl   world” confessed phil suddenly “so mr blake  asked you  marry him  last” said anne calmly “yes and i sneezed three times while   asking me wasn’t  horrid but i said ‘yes’ almost before  finishedi  so afraid  might change his mind  stop i’m besottedly happy i couldn’t really believe before  jonas would ever care  frivolous me” “phil you’re not really frivolous” said anne gravely “‘way down underneath  frivolous exterior  yours you’ve got  dear loyal womanly little soul why do you hide  so” “i can’t help it queen anne you  righti’m not frivolous

you anne” “ii suppose so” said anne reluctantly she felt  she ought   blushing while making such  confession but she  not   other hand she always blushed hotly when any one said anything about gilbert blythe or christine stuart  her hearing gilbert blythe  christine stuart  nothing  herabsolutely nothing but anne had given up trying  analyze  reason  her blushes as  roy  course she   love  himmadly so how could she help it was  not her ideal who could resist those glorious dark eyes   pleading voice were not half  redmond girls wildly envious and what  charming sonnet  had sent her   box  violets  her birthday anne knew every word    heart it  very good stuff   kind too not exactly up   level  keats or shakespeareeven anne  not so deeply  love   think that but   very tolerable magazine

point  it she recalled  chummy laugh she  gilbert had had together over it  wondered uneasily if life   man who had no sense  humor might not  somewhat uninteresting   long run but who could expect  melancholy inscrutable hero  see  humorous side  things it would  flatly unreasonable chapter xxviii a june evening “i wonder what  would  like  live   world where   always june” said anne  she came through  spice  bloom   twilit orchard   front door steps where marilla  mrs rachel  sitting talking over mrs samson coates’ funeral which they had attended  day dora sat between them diligently studying her lessons but davy  sitting tailorfashion   grass looking  gloomy  depressed  his single dimple would let him “you’d get tired  it” said marilla   sigh “i daresay but just now i feel   would take me  long time  get tired  it if   all  charming  today everything loves june davyboy why this melancholy november face  blossomtime” “i’m just sick  tired  living” said  youthful pessimist “at ten years dear me how sad” “i’m not making fun” said davy  dignity “i’m disdisdiscouraged”bringing out  big word   valiant effort “why  wherefore” asked anne sitting down beside him “‘cause  new teacher  come when mr holmes got sick give me ten sums  do  monday it’ll take me all day tomorrow  do them it isn’t fair  have  work saturdays milty boulter said  wouldn’t do them but marilla says i’ve got to i don’t like miss carson  bit” “don’t talk like  about your teacher davy keith” said mrs rachel severely “miss carson   very fine girl there  no nonsense about her” “that doesn’t sound very attractive” laughed anne “i like people  have  little nonsense about them but i’m inclined  have  better opinion  miss carson than you have i saw her  prayermeeting last night  she   pair  eyes  can’t always look sensible now davyboy take heart  grace ‘tomorrow  bring another day’  i’ll help you   sums  far   me lies don’t waste this lovely hour ‘twixt light  dark worrying over arithmetic” “well i won’t” said davy brightening up “if you help me   sums i’ll have ‘em done  time  go fishing  milty i wish old aunt atossa’s funeral  tomorrow instead  today i wanted  go   ‘cause milty said his mother said aunt atossa would  sure  rise up  her coffin  say sarcastic things   folks  come  see her buried but marilla said she didn’t” “poor atossa laid  her coffin peaceful enough” said mrs lynde solemnly “i never saw her look so pleasant before that’s what well there weren’t many tears shed over her poor old soul the elisha wrights  thankful   rid  her  i can’t say i blame them  mite” “it seems  me  most dreadful thing  go out   world  not leave one person behind you who  sorry you  gone” said anne shuddering “nobody except her parents ever loved poor atossa that’s certain not even her husband” averred mrs lynde “she  his fourth wife he’d sort  got into  habit  marrying he only lived  few years after  married her the doctor said  died  dyspepsia but i shall always maintain   died  atossa’s tongue that’s what poor soul she always knew everything about her neighbors but she never  very well acquainted  herself well she’s gone anyhow  i suppose  next excitement   diana’s wedding” “it seems funny  horrible  think  diana’s being married” sighed anne hugging her knees  looking through  gap   haunted wood   light   shining  diana’s room “i don’t see what’s horrible about it when she’s doing so well” said mrs lynde emphatically “fred wright   fine farm     model young man” “he certainly isn’t  wild dashing wicked young man diana once wanted  marry” smiled anne “fred  extremely good” “that’s just what  ought  be would you want diana  marry  wicked man or marry one yourself” “oh no i wouldn’t want  marry anybody who  wicked but i think i’d like  if  could  wicked  wouldn’t now fred  hopelessly good” “you’ll have more sense some day i hope” said marilla marilla spoke rather bitterly she  grievously disappointed she knew anne had refused gilbert blythe avonlea gossip buzzed over  fact which had leaked out nobody knew how perhaps charlie sloane had guessed  told his guesses  truth perhaps diana had betrayed   fred  fred had been indiscreet at all events   known mrs blythe no longer asked anne  public or private if she had heard lately  gilbert but passed her    frosty bow anne who had always liked gilbert’s merry younghearted mother  grieved  secret over this marilla said nothing but mrs lynde gave anne many exasperated digs about it until fresh gossip reached  worthy lady through  medium  moody spurgeon macpherson’s mother  anne had another “beau”  college who  rich  handsome  good all  one after  mrs rachel held her tongue though she still wished  her inmost heart  anne had accepted gilbert riches  all very well but even mrs rachel practical soul though she was did not consider them  one essential if anne “liked”  handsome unknown better than gilbert there  nothing more   said but mrs rachel  dreadfully afraid  anne  going  make  mistake  marrying  money marilla knew anne too well  fear this but she felt  something   universal scheme  things had gone sadly awry “what   be  be” said mrs rachel gloomily “and what isn’t   happens sometimes i can’t help believing it’s going  happen  anne’s case if providence doesn’t interfere that’s what” mrs rachel sighed she  afraid providence wouldn’t interfere  she didn’t dare to anne had wandered down   dryad’s bubble   curled up among  ferns   root   big white birch where she  gilbert had so often sat  summers gone by he had gone into  newspaper office again when college

when such  walk  gilbert through lovers’ lane would have been far too dangerous but roy  christine had made  very safe now anne found herself thinking  good deal about christine  she chatted lightly  gilbert she had met her several times before leaving kingsport  had been charmingly sweet  her christine had also been charmingly sweet indeed they   most cordial pair but  all that their acquaintance had not ripened into friendship evidently christine  not  kindred spirit “are you going    avonlea all summer” asked gilbert “no i’m going down east  valley road next week esther haythorne wants me  teach  her through july  august they have  summer term   school  esther isn’t feeling well so i’m going  substitute  her in one way i don’t mind do you know i’m beginning  feel  little bit like  stranger  avonlea now it makes me sorrybut it’s true it’s quite appalling  see  number  children who have shot up into big boys  girlsreally young men  womenthese past two years half  my pupils  grown up it makes me feel awfully old  see them   places you  i  our mates used  fill” anne laughed  sighed she felt very old  mature  wisewhich showed how young she was she told herself  she longed greatly  go back  those dear merry days when life  seen through  rosy mist  hope  illusion  possessed  indefinable something  had passed away forever where   nowthe glory   dream “‘so wags  world away’” quoted gilbert practically   trifle absently anne wondered if   thinking  christine oh avonlea  going   so lonely nowwith diana gone chapter xxx mrs skinner’s romance anne stepped off  train  valley road station  looked about  see if any one had come  meet her she   board   certain miss janet sweet but she saw no one who answered   least  her preconception   lady  formed  esther’s letter the only person  sight   elderly woman sitting   wagon  mail bags piled around her two hundred would have been  charitable guess  her weight her face   round  red   harvestmoon  almost  featureless she wore  tight black cashmere dress made   fashion  ten years ago  little dusty black straw hat trimmed  bows  yellow ribbon  faded black lace mits “here you” she called waving her whip  anne “are you  new valley road schoolma’am” “yes” “well i thought so valley road  noted   goodlooking schoolma’ams just  millersville  noted   humly ones janet sweet asked me this morning if i could bring you out i said

it’s only two miles  janet’s her nextdoor neighbor’s hired boy  coming  your trunk tonight my name  skinneramelia skinner” anne  eventually tucked in exchanging amused smiles  herself during  process “jog along black mare” commanded mrs skinner gathering up  reins  her pudgy hands “this  my first trip   mail rowte thomas wanted  hoe his turnips today so  asked me  come so i jest sot down  took

you see we haven’t been married very long” “oh” said anne politely “just  month thomas courted me  quite  spell though it  real romantic” anne tried  picture mrs skinner  speaking terms  romance  failed “oh” she said again “yes y’see there  another man after me jog along black mare i’d been  widder so long folks had given up expecting me  marry again but when my dartershe’s  schoolma’am like

asked anne “well y’see  didn’t love me” answered mrs skinner solemnly anne opened her eyes widely  looked  mrs skinner but there  not  glint  humor   lady’s face evidently mrs skinner saw nothing amusing  her own case “he’d been  widderman  three yers  his sister kept house  him then she got married   just wanted some one  look after his house it  worth looking after too mind you that it’s  handsome house jog along black mare as  thomas   poor  if his house didn’t leak  dry weather   about all  could  said  it though  looks kind  pictureaskew but y’see i loved thomas  i didn’t care one

queried anne “oh  rumpussed  bit but he’s going  see  skinny old maid  millersville now  i guess she’ll take him fast enough she’ll make him  better wife than his first did wo never wanted  marry her

mrs skinner highly flattered “wait till i tell thomas that he always feels dretful tickled when i git  compliment jog along black mare well here we are i hope you’ll git  well   school miss there’s

 rose  attend  prayermeeting she wore  paleblue pansysprinkled muslin dress  more ruffles than one would ever have supposed economical janet could  guilty of   white leghorn hat  pink roses  three ostrich feathers  it anne felt quite amazed later on she found out janet’s motive  so arraying herselfa motive  old  eden valley road prayermeetings seemed   essentially feminine there  thirtytwo women present two halfgrown boys  one solitary man beside  minister anne found herself studying this man he  not handsome or young or graceful  had remarkably long legsso long   had  keep them coiled up under his chair  dispose  themand   stoopshouldered his hands  big his hair wanted barbering  his moustache  unkempt but anne thought she liked his face   kind  honest  tender there  something else  it toojust what anne found  hard  define she finally concluded  this man had suffered  been strong   had been made manifest  his face there   sort  patient humorous endurance  his expression which indicated   would go   stake if need be but would keep  looking pleasant until  really had  begin squirming when prayermeeting  over this man came up  janet  said “may i see you home janet” janet took his arm“as primly  shyly  if she  no more than sixteen having her first escort home” anne told  girls  patty’s place later on “miss shirley permit me  introduce mr douglas” she said stiffly mr douglas nodded  said “i  looking  you  prayermeeting miss  thinking what  nice little girl you were” such  speech  ninetynine people out   hundred would have annoyed anne bitterly but  way  which mr douglas said  made her feel  she had received  very real  pleasing compliment she smiled appreciatively  him  dropped obligingly behind   moonlit road so janet had  beau anne  delighted janet would make  paragon   wifecheery economical tolerant   very queen  cooks it would   flagrant waste  nature’s part  keep her  permanent old maid “john douglas asked me  take you up  see his mother” said janet  next day “she’s bedrid  lot   time  never goes out   house but she’s powerful fond  company  always wants  see my boarders can you go up this evening” anne assented but later   day mr douglas called  his mother’s behalf  invite them up  tea  saturday evening “oh why didn’t you put  your pretty pansy dress” asked anne when they left home it   hot day  poor janet between her excitement  her heavy black cashmere dress looked  if she  being broiled alive “old mrs douglas would think  terrible frivolous  unsuitable i’m afraid john likes  dress though” she added wistfully the old douglas homestead  half  mile  “wayside” cresting  windy hill the house itself  large  comfortable old enough   dignified  girdled  maple groves  orchards there  big trim barns behind it  everything bespoke prosperity whatever  patient endurance  mr douglas’ face had meant  hadn’t so anne reflected meant debts  duns john douglas met them   door  took them into  sittingroom where his mother  enthroned   armchair anne had expected old mrs douglas   tall  thin because mr douglas was instead she   tiny scrap   woman  soft pink cheeks mild blue eyes   mouth like  baby’s dressed   beautiful fashionablymade black silk dress   fluffy white shawl over her shoulders  her snowy hair surmounted   dainty lace cap she might have posed   grandmother doll “how do you do janet dear” she said sweetly “i am so glad  see you again dear” she put up her pretty old face   kissed “and this  our new teacher i’m delighted  meet you my son  been singing your praises until i’m half jealous  i’m sure janet ought   wholly so” poor janet blushed anne said something polite  conventional  then everybody sat down  made talk it  hard work even  anne  nobody seemed  ease except old mrs douglas who certainly did not find any difficulty  talking she made janet sit  her  stroked her hand occasionally janet sat  smiled looking horribly uncomfortable  her hideous dress  john douglas sat without smiling at  tea table mrs douglas gracefully asked janet  pour  tea janet turned redder than ever but did it anne wrote  description   meal  stella “we had cold tongue  chicken  strawberry preserves lemon pie  tarts  chocolate cake  raisin cookies  pound cake  fruit cakeand  few other things including more piecaramel pie i think  was after i had eaten twice  much   good  me mrs douglas sighed  said she feared she had nothing  tempt my appetite “‘i’m afraid dear janet’s cooking  spoiled you  any other’ she said sweetly ‘of course nobody  valley road aspires  rival her won’t you have another piece  pie miss shirley you haven’t eaten anything’ “stella i had eaten  helping  tongue  one  chicken three biscuits  generous allowance  preserves  piece  pie  tart   square  chocolate cake” after tea mrs douglas smiled benevolently  told john  take “dear janet” out into  garden  get her some roses “miss shirley  keep me company while you  outwon’t you” she said plaintively she settled down  her armchair   sigh “i am  very frail old woman miss shirley for over twenty years i’ve been  great sufferer for twenty long weary years i’ve been dying  inches” “how painful” said anne trying   sympathetic  succeeding only  feeling idiotic “there have been scores  nights when they’ve thought i could never live  see  dawn” went  mrs douglas solemnly “nobody knows what i’ve gone throughnobody can know but myself well  can’t last very much longer now my weary pilgrimage  soon  over miss shirley it   great comfort  me  john  have such  good wife  look after him when his mother  gonea great comfort miss shirley” “janet   lovely woman” said anne warmly “lovely a beautiful character” assented mrs douglas “and  perfect housekeepersomething i never was my health would not permit it miss shirley i am indeed thankful  john  made such  wise choice i hope  believe     happy he  my only son miss shirley  his happiness lies very near my heart” “of course” said anne stupidly for  first time  her life she  stupid yet she could not imagine why she seemed  have absolutely nothing  say  this sweet smiling angelic old lady who  patting her hand so kindly “come  see me soon again dear janet” said mrs douglas lovingly when they left “you don’t come half often enough but then i suppose john   bringing you here  stay all  time one  these days” anne happening  glance  john douglas  his mother spoke gave  positive start  dismay he looked   tortured man might look when his tormentors gave  rack  last turn  possible endurance she felt sure  must  ill  hurried poor blushing janet away “isn’t old mrs douglas  sweet woman” asked janet  they went down  road “mm” answered anne absently she  wondering why john douglas had looked so “she’s been  terrible sufferer” said janet feelingly “she takes terrible spells it keeps john all worried up he’s scared  leave home  fear his mother  take  spell  nobody there but  hired girl” chapter xxxiii “he just kept coming  coming” three days later anne came home  school  found janet crying tears  janet seemed so incongruous  anne  honestly alarmed “oh what   matter” she cried anxiously “i’mi’m forty today” sobbed janet “well you  nearly  yesterday   didn’t hurt” comforted anne trying not  smile “butbut” went  janet   big gulp “john douglas won’t ask me  marry him” “oh but  will” said anne lamely “you must give him time janet “time” said janet  indescribable scorn “he  had twenty years how much time does  want” “do you mean  john douglas  been coming  see you  twenty years” “he has and   never so much  mentioned marriage  me and i don’t believe  ever  now i’ve never said  word   mortal about it but  seems  me i’ve just got  talk  out  some one  last or go crazy john douglas begun  go  me twenty years ago before mother died well  kept coming  coming  after  spell i begun making quilts  things but  never said anything about getting married only just kept coming  coming there wasn’t anything i could do mother died when we’d been going together  eight years i thought  maybe would speak out then seeing  i  left alone   world he  real kind  feeling  did everything  could  me but  never said marry and that’s  way   been going  ever since people blame me  it they say i won’t marry him because his mother  so sickly  i don’t want  bother  waiting  her why i’d love  wait  john’s mother but i let them think so i’d rather they’d blame me than pity me it’s so dreadful humiliating  john won’t ask me and why won’t he seems  me if i only knew his reason i wouldn’t mind  so much” “perhaps his mother doesn’t want him  marry anybody” suggested anne “oh she does she’s told me time  again  she’d love  see john settled before her time comes she’s always giving him hintsyou heard her yourself  other day i thought i’d ha’ gone through  floor” “it’s beyond me” said anne helplessly she thought  ludovic speed but  cases  not parallel john douglas  not  man  ludovic’s type “you should show more spirit janet” she went  resolutely “why didn’t you send him about his business long ago” “i couldn’t” said poor janet pathetically “you see anne i’ve always been awful fond  john he might just  well keep coming  not  there  never anybody else i’d want so  didn’t matter” “but  might have made him speak out like  man” urged anne janet shook her head “no i guess not i  afraid  try anyway  fear he’d think i meant   just go i suppose i’m  poorspirited creature but   how i feel and i can’t help it” “oh you could help it janet it isn’t too late yet take  firm stand let  man know you  not going  endure his shillyshallying any longer i’ll back you up” “i dunno” said janet hopelessly “i dunno if i could ever get up enough spunk things have drifted so long but i’ll think  over” anne felt  she  disappointed  john douglas she had liked him so well  she had not thought him  sort  man who would play fast  loose   woman’s feelings  twenty years he certainly should  taught  lesson  anne felt vindictively  she would enjoy seeing  process therefore she  delighted when janet told her  they  going  prayermeeting  next night  she meant  show some “sperrit” “i’ll let john douglas see i’m not going   trodden  any longer” “you  perfectly right” said anne emphatically when prayermeeting  over john douglas came up  his usual request janet looked frightened but resolute “no thank you” she said icily “i know  road home pretty well alone i ought to seeing i’ve been traveling   forty years so you needn’t trouble yourself mr douglas” anne  looking  john douglas and   brilliant moonlight she saw  last twist   rack again without  word  turned  strode down  road “stop stop” anne called wildly after him not caring   least   other dumbfounded onlookers “mr douglas stop come back” john douglas stopped but  did not come back anne flew down  road caught his arm  fairly dragged him back  janet “you must come back” she said imploringly “it’s all  mistake mr douglasall my fault i made janet do it she didn’t want tobut it’s all right now isn’t it janet” without  word janet took his arm  walked away anne followed them meekly home  slipped    back door “well you   nice person  back me up” said janet sarcastically “i couldn’t help it janet” said anne repentantly “i just felt  if i had stood   seen murder done i had  run after him” “oh i’m just  glad you did when i saw john douglas making off down  road i just felt  if every little bit  joy  happiness   left  my life  going  him it   awful feeling” “did  ask you why you did it” asked anne “no  never said  word about it” replied janet dully chapter xxxiv john douglas speaks  last anne  not without  feeble hope  something might come   after all but nothing did john douglas came  took janet driving  walked home  prayermeeting  her   had been doing  twenty years    seemed likely  do  twenty years more the summer waned anne taught her school  wrote letters  studied  little her walks    school  pleasant she always went  way   swamp    lovely placea boggy soil green   greenest  mossy hillocks  silvery brook meandered through   spruces stood erectly their boughs atrail  graygreen mosses their roots overgrown  all sorts  woodland lovelinesses nevertheless anne found life  valley road  little monotonous to  sure there  one diverting incident she had not seen  lank towheaded samuel   peppermints since  evening  his call save  chance meetings   road but one warm august night  appeared  solemnly seated himself   rustic bench   porch he wore his usual working habiliments consisting  varipatched trousers  blue jean shirt out   elbows   ragged straw hat he  chewing  straw   kept  chewing  while  looked solemnly  anne anne laid her book aside   sigh  took up her doily conversation  sam  really out   question after  long silence sam suddenly spoke “i’m leaving over there”  said abruptly waving his straw   direction   neighboring house “oh  you” said anne politely “yep” “and where  you going now” “wall i’ve been thinking some  gitting  place  my own there’s one that’d suit me over  millersville but ef i rents  i’ll want  woman” “i suppose so” said anne vaguely “yep” there  another long silence finally sam removed his straw again  said “will yeh hev me” “what” gasped anne “will yeh hev me” “do you meanmarry you” queried poor anne feebly “yep” “why i’m hardly acquainted  you” cried anne indignantly “but yeh’d git acquainted  me after we  married” said sam anne gathered up her poor dignity “certainly i won’t marry you” she said haughtily “wall yeh might do worse” expostulated sam “i’m  good worker  i’ve got some money   bank” “don’t speak  this  me again whatever put such  idea into your head” said anne her sense  humor getting  better  her wrath it  such  absurd situation “yeh’re  likelylooking girl  hev  rightsmart way o’ stepping” said sam “i don’t want no lazy woman think  over i won’t change my mind yit awhile wall i must  gitting gotter milk  cows” anne’s illusions concerning proposals had suffered so much  late years  there  few  them left so she could laugh wholeheartedly over this one not feeling any secret sting she mimicked poor sam  janet  night  both  them laughed immoderately over his plunge into sentiment one afternoon when anne’s sojourn  valley road  drawing   close alec ward came driving down  “wayside”  hot haste  janet “they want you   douglas place quick”  said “i really believe old mrs douglas  going  die  last after pretending  do   twenty years” janet ran  get her hat anne asked if mrs douglas  worse than usual “she’s not half  bad” said alec solemnly “and that’s what makes me think it’s serious other times she’d  screaming  throwing herself all over  place this time she’s lying still  mum when mrs douglas  mum she  pretty sick you bet” “you don’t like old mrs douglas” said anne curiously “i like cats  is cats i don’t like cats   women”  alec’s cryptic reply janet came home   twilight “mrs douglas  dead” she said wearily “she died soon after i got there she just spoke  me once‘i suppose you’ll marry john now’ she said it cut me   heart anne to think john’s own mother thought i wouldn’t marry him because  her i couldn’t say  word eitherthere  other women there i  thankful john had gone out” janet began  cry drearily but anne brewed her  hot drink  ginger tea  her comforting to  sure anne discovered later   she had used white pepper instead  ginger but janet never knew  difference the evening after  funeral janet  anne  sitting   front porch steps  sunset the wind had fallen asleep   pinelands  lurid sheets  heatlightning flickered across  northern skies janet wore her ugly black dress  looked her very worst her eyes  nose red  crying they talked little  janet seemed faintly  resent anne’s efforts  cheer her up she plainly preferred   miserable suddenly  gatelatch clicked  john douglas strode into  garden he walked towards them straight over  geranium bed janet stood up so did anne anne   tall girl  wore  white dress but john douglas did not see her “janet”  said “will you marry me” the words burst out  if they had been wanting   said  twenty years  must  uttered now before anything else janet’s face  so red  crying   couldn’t turn any redder so  turned  most unbecoming purple “why didn’t you ask me before” she said slowly “i couldn’t she made me promise not tomother made me promise not to nineteen years ago she took  terrible spell we thought she couldn’t live through it she implored me  promise not  ask you  marry me while she  alive i didn’t want  promise such  thing even though we all thought she couldn’t live very longthe doctor only gave her six months but she begged   her knees sick  suffering i had  promise” “what had your mother against me” cried janet “nothingnothing she just didn’t want another womanany womanthere while she  living she said if i didn’t promise she’d die right there  i’d have killed her so i promised and she’s held me   promise ever since though i’ve gone  my knees  her  my turn  beg her  let me off” “why didn’t you tell me this” asked janet chokingly “if i’d only known why didn’t you just tell me” “she made me promise i wouldn’t tell  soul” said john hoarsely “she swore me     bible janet i’d never have done  if i’d dreamed      so long janet you’ll never know what i’ve suffered these nineteen years i know i’ve made you suffer too but you’ll marry me  all won’t you janet oh janet won’t you i’ve come  soon  i could  ask you” at this moment  stupefied anne came  her senses  realized  she had no business   there she slipped away  did not see janet until  next morning when  latter told her  rest   story “that cruel relentless deceitful old woman” cried anne “hushshe’s dead” said janet solemnly “if she wasn’tbut she is so we mustn’t speak evil  her but i’m happy  last anne and i wouldn’t have minded waiting so long  bit if i’d only known why” “when  you   married” “next month of course    very quiet i suppose people  talk terrible they’ll say i made enough haste  snap john up  soon  his poor mother  out   way john wanted  let them know  truth but i said ‘no john after all she  your mother  we’ll keep  secret between us  not cast any shadow  her memory i don’t mind what people say now  i know  truth myself it don’t matter  mite let  all  buried   dead’ says i  him so i coaxed him round  agree  me” “you’re much more forgiving than i could ever be” anne said rather crossly “you’ll feel differently about  good many things when you get   my age” said janet tolerantly “that’s one   things we learn  we grow olderhow  forgive it comes easier  forty than  did  twenty” chapter xxxv the last redmond year opens “here we are all back again nicely sunburned  rejoicing   strong man  run  race” said phil sitting down   suitcase   sigh  pleasure “isn’t  jolly  see this dear old patty’s place againand auntyand  cats rusty  lost another piece  ear hasn’t he” “rusty would   nicest cat   world if  had no ears  all” declared anne loyally  her trunk while rusty writhed about her lap   frenzy  welcome “aren’t you glad  see us back aunty” demanded phil “yes but i wish you’d tidy things up” said aunt jamesina plaintively looking   wilderness  trunks  suitcases

could weave such wizardry  those funny tearful tales   story club among  manuscripts anne found one written  sheets  wrapping paper a wave  laughter filled her gray eyes  she recalled  time  place

“i am going  squander    wild soulless revel  some sort” declared anne gaily “at all events  isn’t tainted moneylike  check i got   horrible reliable baking powder story i spent it usefully  clothes

“authors  kittle cattle you never know when or how they  break out anne may make copy  us” “i meant   ability  write   press   great responsibility” said aunt jamesina severely “and i hope anne

i don’t know how she ever came  decide  being  missionary i’m thankful she didi prayed  she mightbuti wish she hadn’t” then aunt jamesina wondered why those giddy girls all laughed anne’s eyes shone

hardly  pleasant one she had never met any  roy’s family she realized  significance  his statement   had somehow  irrevocableness about   chilled her “i shall  glad  see them” she said flatly  then

member  their clan “i shall just  myself i shall not try  make  good impression” thought anne loftily but she  wondering what dress she would better wear saturday afternoon  if  new style  high hairdressing would suit her better than  old   walking party  rather spoiled  her by night she had decided  she would wear her brown chiffon  saturday but would do her hair low friday afternoon none

affection  rusty  not especially fond  cats but mrs gardner’s tone annoyed her inconsequently she remembered  mrs john blythe  so fond  cats  she kept  many  her husband would allow “they are adorable animals aren’t they” she said wickedly “i have never liked cats” said mrs gardner remotely “i love them” said dorothy “they  so nice  selfish dogs  too good  unselfish they make me feel uncomfortable

“‘of all sad words  tongue or pen the saddest   might have been’” quoted priscilla tragically lifting  cushion “this cake  now what you might call  flat failure and  cushion  likewise ruined never

haven’t we been pretty good girls take us   large these three winters you’ve mothered us” pleaded phil “you’ve been four   dearest sweetest goodest girls  ever went together through college” averred aunt jamesina who never spoiled  compliment  misplaced economy “but i mistrust you haven’t any too much sense yet it’s not   expected  course experience teaches sense you can’t learn    college course you’ve been  college four years  i never was but i know heaps more than you do young ladies” “‘there  lots  things  never go  rule there’s  powerful pile o’ knowledge that you never get  college there  heaps  things you never learn  school’” quoted stella “have you learned anything  redmond except dead languages  geometry  such trash” queried aunt jamesina “oh yes i think we have aunty” protested anne “we’ve learned  truth  what professor woodleigh told us last philomathic” said phil “he said ‘humor   spiciest condiment   feast  existence laugh  your mistakes but learn  them joke over your troubles but gather strength  them make  jest  your difficulties but overcome them’ isn’t  worth learning aunt jimsie” “yes  is dearie when you’ve learned  laugh   things  should  laughed at  not  laugh  those  shouldn’t you’ve got wisdom  understanding” “what have you got out  your redmond course anne” murmured priscilla aside “i think” said anne slowly “that i really have learned  look upon each little hindrance   jest  each great one   foreshadowing  victory summing up i think   what redmond  given me” “i shall have  fall back  another professor woodleigh quotation  express what   done  me” said priscilla “you remember   said  his address ‘there  so much   world  us all if we only have  eyes  see it   heart  love it   hand  gather   ourselvesso much  men  women so much  art

learnif you’ve got natural gumption enoughin four years  college what  would take about twenty years  living  teach you well  justifies higher education  my opinion it’s  matter i  always dubious about before” “but what about people who haven’t natural gumption aunt jimsie” “people who haven’t natural gumption never learn” retorted aunt jamesina “neither  college nor life if they live    hundred they really don’t know anything more than when they  born it’s their misfortune not their fault poor souls but those  us who have some gumption should duly thank  lord  it” “will you please define what gumption is aunt jimsie” asked phil “no i won’t young woman any one who  gumption knows what  is  any one who hasn’t can never know what  is so there  no need  defining it” the busy days flew   examinations  over anne took high honors  english priscilla took honors  classics  phil  mathematics stella obtained  good allround showing then came convocation “this  what i would once have called  epoch  my life” said anne  she took roy’s violets out  their box  gazed  them thoughtfully she meant  carry them  course but her eyes wandered  another box  her table it  filled  liliesofthevalley  fresh  fragrant  those which bloomed   green gables yard when june came  avonlea gilbert blythe’s card lay beside it anne wondered why gilbert should have sent her flowers

circles expected  announcement  her engagement  roy any day anne expected  herself yet just before she left patty’s place  convocation she flung roy’s violets aside  put gilbert’s liliesofthevalley  their place she could not have told why she did it somehow old avonlea days  dreams  friendships seemed very close  her  this attainment  her longcherished ambitions she  gilbert had once picturedout merrily  day  which they should  capped  gowned graduates  arts the wonderful day had come  roy’s violets had no place  it only her old friend’s flowers seemed  belong  this fruition  oldblossoming hopes which  had once shared for years this day had beckoned  allured  her but when  came  one single keen abiding memory  left  her  not    breathless moment when  stately president  redmond gave her cap  diploma  hailed her ba   not   flash  gilbert’s eyes when  saw her lilies nor  puzzled pained glance roy gave her   passed her   platform it  not  aline gardner’s condescending congratulations or

enamel heart   pendant on  accompanying card  written “with all good wishes  your old chum gilbert” anne laughing over  memory  enamel heart conjured up  fatal day when gilbert had called her “carrots”  vainly tried  make his peace   pink candy heart had written him  nice little note  thanks but she had never worn  trinket tonight she fastened  about her white throat   dreamy smile she  phil walked  redmond together anne walked  silence phil chattered  many things suddenly she said “i heard today  gilbert blythe’s engagement  christine stuart    announced  soon  convocation  over did you hear anything  it” “no” said anne “i think it’s true” said phil lightly anne did not speak in  darkness she felt her face burning she slipped her hand inside her collar  caught   gold chain one energetic twist   gave way anne thrust  broken trinket into her pocket her hands  trembling  her eyes  smarting but she   gayest  all  gay revellers  night  told gilbert unregretfully  her card  full when  came  ask her   dance afterwards when she sat   girls before  dying embers  patty’s place removing  spring chilliness  their satin skins none chatted more blithely than she   day’s events “moody spurgeon macpherson called here tonight after you left” said aunt jamesina who had sat up  keep  fire on “he didn’t know about  graduation dance that boy ought  sleep   rubber band around his head

priscilla “he  concerned  graver matters than his ears he  going    minister you know” “well i suppose  lord doesn’t regard  ears   man” said aunt jamesina gravely dropping all further criticism

wistfullyher pretty blue room where she had spent three such happy years she had knelt   window  pray  had bent    watch  sunset behind  pines she had heard  autumn raindrops beating against   had welcomed  spring robins   sill she wondered if old dreams could haunt roomsif when one left forever  room where she had joyed  suffered  laughed  wept something  her intangible  invisible yet nonetheless real did not remain behind like  voiceful memory “i think” said phil “that  room where one dreams  grieves  rejoices  lives becomes inseparably connected  those processes  acquires  personality   own i am sure if i came into this room fifty years  now  would say ‘anne anne’  me what nice times we’ve had here honey what chats  jokes  good chummy jamborees oh dear me i’m  marry jo  june  i know i   rapturously happy but just now i feel  if i wanted this lovely redmond life  go  forever” “i’m unreasonable enough just now  wish that too” admitted anne “no matter what deeper joys may come  us later  we’ll never again have just  same delightful irresponsible existence we’ve had here it’s over forever phil” “what  you going  do  rusty” asked phil   privileged pussy padded into  room “i am going  take him home  me  joseph   sarahcat” announced aunt jamesina following rusty “it would   shame  separate those cats now  they have learned  live together it’s  hard lesson  cats  humans  learn” “i’m sorry  part  rusty” said anne regretfully “but  would  no use  take him  green gables marilla detests cats  davy would tease his life out besides i don’t suppose i’ll  home very long i’ve been offered  principalship   summerside high school” “are you going  accept it” asked phil “ii haven’t decided yet” answered anne   confused flush phil nodded understandingly naturally anne’s plans could not  settled until roy had spoken he would soonthere  no doubt  that and there  no doubt  anne would say “yes” when  said “will you please” anne herself regarded  state  affairs   seldomruffled complacency she  deeply  love  roy true   not just what she had imagined love  be but  anything  life anne asked herself wearily like one’s imagination  it it   old diamond disillusion  childhood repeatedthe same disappointment she had felt when she had first seen  chill sparkle instead   purple splendor she had anticipated “that’s not my idea   diamond” she had said but roy   dear fellow  they would  very happy together even if some indefinable zest  missing out  life when roy came down  evening  asked anne  walk   park every one  patty’s place knew what  had come  say  every one knew or thought they knew what anne’s answer would be “anne   very fortunate girl” said aunt jamesina “i suppose so” said stella shrugging her shoulders “roy   nice fellow  all that but there’s really nothing  him” “that sounds very like  jealous remark stella maynard” said aunt jamesina rebukingly “it doesbut i am not jealous” said stella calmly “i love anne  i like roy everybody says she  making  brilliant match  even mrs gardner thinks her charming now it all sounds  if   made  heaven but i have my doubts make  most  that aunt jamesina” roy asked anne  marry him   little pavilion

lovers had done out   deportment  courtship  marriage the whole effect  quite flawless and   also sincere there  no doubt  roy meant what  said there  no false note  jar  symphony anne felt  she ought   thrilling  head  foot but she wasn’t she  horribly cool when roy paused  his answer she opened her lips  say her fateful yes and thenshe found herself trembling  if she  reeling back   precipice to her came one  those moments when we realize    blinding flash  illumination more than all our previous years have taught us she pulled her hand  roy’s “oh i can’t marry youi can’ti can’t” she cried wildly roy turned paleand also looked rather foolish he hadsmall blame  himfelt very sure “what do you mean”  stammered “i mean  i can’t marry you” repeated anne desperately “i thought i couldbut i can’t” “why can’t you” roy asked more calmly “becausei don’t care enough  you” a crimson streak came into roy’s face “so you’ve just been amusing yourself these two years”  said slowly “no no i haven’t” gasped poor anne oh how could she explain she couldn’t explain there  some things  cannot  explained “i did think i caredtruly i didbut i know now i don’t” “you have ruined my life” said roy bitterly “forgive me” pleaded anne miserably  hot cheeks  stinging eyes roy turned away  stood   few minutes looking out seaward when  came back  anne   very pale again “you can give me no hope”  said anne shook her head mutely “thengoodbye” said roy “i can’t understand iti can’t believe you  not  woman i’ve believed you  be but reproaches  idle between us you   only woman i can ever love i thank you  your friendship  least goodbye anne” “goodbye” faltered anne when roy had gone she sat   long time   pavilion watching  white mist creeping subtly  remorselessly landward up  harbor it  her hour  humiliation  selfcontempt  shame their waves went over her and yet underneath  all   queer sense  recovered freedom she slipped into patty’s place   dusk  escaped  her room but phil  there   window

senses” “i think so” said anne wearily “oh phil don’t scold me you don’t understand” “i certainly don’t understand you’ve encouraged roy gardner  every way  two yearsand now you tell me you’ve refused him then you’ve just been flirting scandalously  him anne i couldn’t have believed   you” “i wasn’t flirting  himi honestly thought i cared up   last minuteand thenwell i just knew i never could marry him” “i suppose” said phil cruelly “that you intended  marry him  his money  then your better self rose up  prevented you” “i didn’t i never thought about his money oh i can’t explain   you any more than i could  him” “well i certainly think you have treated roy shamefully” said phil  exasperation “he’s handsome  clever  rich  good what more do you want” “i want some one who belongs  my life he doesn’t i  swept off my feet  first  his good looks  knack  paying romantic compliments  later  i thought i must   love because   my darkeyed ideal” “i am bad enough  not knowing my own mind but you  worse” said phil “i do know my own mind” protested anne “the trouble is my mind changes  then i have  get acquainted   all over again” “well i suppose there  no use  saying anything  you” “there  no need phil i’m   dust this  spoiled everything backwards i can never think  redmond days without recalling  humiliation  this evening roy despises meand you despise meand i despise myself” “you poor darling” said phil melting “just come here  let me comfort you i’ve no right  scold you i’d have married alec or alonzo if i hadn’t met jo oh anne things  so mixedup  real life they aren’t clearcut  trimmed off  they   novels” “i hope  no one  ever again ask me  marry him  long  i live” sobbed poor anne devoutly believing  she meant it chapter xxxix deals  weddings anne felt  life partook   nature   anticlimax during  first few weeks after her return  green gables she missed  merry comradeship  patty’s place she had dreamed some brilliant dreams during  past winter  now they lay   dust around her in her present mood  selfdisgust she could not immediately begin dreaming again and she discovered that while solitude  dreams  glorious solitude without them  few charms she had not seen roy again after their painful parting   park pavilion but dorothy came  see her before she left kingsport “i’m awfully sorry you won’t marry roy” she said “i did want you   sister but you  quite right he would bore you  death i love him     dear sweet boy but really  isn’t  bit interesting he looks  if  ought  be but  isn’t” “this won’t spoil our friendship  it dorothy” anne had asked wistfully “no indeed you’re too good  lose if i can’t have you   sister i mean  keep you   chum anyway and don’t fret over roy he  feeling terribly just nowi have  listen  his outpourings every daybut he’ll get over it he always does” “ohalways” said anne   slight change  voice “so   ‘got over it’ before” “dear me yes” said dorothy frankly “twice before and  raved  me just  same both times not   others actually refused himthey simply announced their engagements  some one else of course when  met you  vowed  me   had never really loved beforethat  previous affairs had been merely boyish fancies but i don’t think you need worry” anne decided not  worry her feelings   mixture  relief  resentment roy had certainly told her she   only one  had ever loved no doubt  believed it but    comfort  feel  she had not  all likelihood ruined his life there  other goddesses  roy according  dorothy must needs  worshipping  some shrine nevertheless life  stripped  several more illusions  anne began  think drearily   seemed rather bare she came down   porch gable   evening  her return   sorrowful face “what  happened   old snow queen marilla” “oh i knew you’d feel bad over that” said marilla “i felt bad myself that tree  there ever since i   young girl it blew down   big gale we had  march it  rotten   core” “i’ll miss  so” grieved anne “the porch gable doesn’t seem  same room without it i’ll never look   window again without  sense  loss and oh i never came home  green gables before  diana wasn’t here  welcome me” “diana  something else  think  just now” said mrs lynde significantly “well tell me all  avonlea news” said anne sitting down   porch steps where  evening sunshine fell over her hair   fine golden rain “there isn’t much news except what we’ve wrote you” said mrs lynde “i suppose you haven’t heard  simon fletcher broke his leg last week it’s  great thing  his family they’re getting  hundred things done  they’ve always wanted  do but couldn’t  long    about  old crank” “he came   aggravating family” remarked marilla “aggravating well rather his mother used  get up  prayermeeting  tell all her children’s shortcomings  ask prayers  them ‘course  made them mad  worse than ever” “you haven’t told anne  news about jane” suggested marilla “oh jane” sniffed mrs lynde “well” she conceded grudgingly “jane andrews  home   westcame last weekand she’s going   married   winnipeg millionaire you may  sure mrs harmon lost no time  telling  far  wide” “dear old janei’m so glad” said anne heartily “she deserves  good things  life” “oh i ain’t saying anything against jane she’s  nice enough girl but she isn’t   millionaire class  you’ll find there’s not much  recommend  man but his money that’s what mrs harmon says he’s  englishman who  made money  mines but i believe he’ll turn out    yankee he certainly must have money    just showered jane  jewelry her engagement ring   diamond cluster so big   looks like  plaster  jane’s fat paw” mrs lynde could not keep some bitterness out  her tone here  jane andrews  plain little plodder engaged   millionaire while anne  seemed  not yet bespoken  any one rich or poor and mrs harmon andrews did brag insufferably “what  gilbert blythe been doing   college” asked marilla “i saw him when  came home last week    so pale  thin i hardly knew him” “he studied very hard last winter” said anne “you know  took high honors  classics   cooper prize it hasn’t been taken  five years so i think he’s rather run down we’re all  little tired” “anyhow you’re  ba  jane andrews isn’t  never  be” said mrs lynde  gloomy satisfaction a few evenings later anne went down  see jane but  latter  away  charlottetown“getting sewing done” mrs harmon informed anne proudly “of course  avonlea dressmaker wouldn’t do  jane under  circumstances” “i’ve heard something very nice about jane” said anne “yes jane  done pretty well even if she isn’t  ba” said mrs harmon   slight toss  her head “mr inglis  worth millions  they’re going  europe  their wedding tour when they come back they’ll live   perfect mansion  marble  winnipeg jane  only one troubleshe can cook so well  her husband won’t let her cook he  so rich  hires his cooking done they’re going  keep  cook  two other maids   coachman   manofallwork but what about you anne i don’t hear anything  your being married after all your collegegoing” “oh” laughed anne “i am going    old maid i really can’t find any one  suit me” it  rather wicked  her she deliberately meant  remind mrs andrews  if she became  old maid   not because she had not had  least one chance  marriage but mrs harmon took swift revenge “well  overparticular girls generally get left i notice and what’s this i hear about gilbert blythe being engaged   miss stuart charlie sloane tells me she  perfectly beautiful is  true” “i don’t know if   true    engaged  miss stuart” replied anne  spartan composure “but   certainly true  she  very lovely” “i once thought you  gilbert would have made  match  it” said mrs harmon “if you don’t take care anne all  your beaux  slip through your fingers” anne decided not  continue her duel  mrs harmon you could not fence   antagonist who met rapier thrust  blow  battle axe “since jane  away” she said rising haughtily “i don’t think i can stay longer this morning i’ll come down when she comes home” “do” said mrs harmon effusively “jane isn’t  bit proud she just means  associate  her old friends  same  ever she’ll  real glad  see you” jane’s millionaire arrived  last  may  carried her off   blaze  splendor mrs lynde  spitefully gratified  find  mr inglis  every day  forty  short  thin  grayish mrs lynde did not spare him  her enumeration  his shortcomings you may  sure “it  take all his gold  gild  pill like him that’s what” said mrs rachel solemnly “he looks kind  goodhearted” said anne loyally “and i’m sure  thinks  world  jane” “humph” said mrs rachel phil gordon  married  next week  anne went over  bolingbroke   her bridesmaid phil made  dainty fairy   bride   rev jo  so radiant  his happiness  nobody thought him plain “we’re going   lovers’ saunter through  land  evangeline” said phil “and then we’ll settle down  patterson street mother thinks   terribleshe thinks jo might  least take  church   decent place but  wilderness   patterson slums  blossom like  rose  me if jo  there oh anne i’m so happy my heart aches  it” anne  always glad   happiness  her friends but   sometimes  little lonely   surrounded everywhere   happiness   not your own and   just  same when she went back  avonlea this time   diana who  bathed   wonderful glory  comes   woman when her firstborn  laid beside her anne looked   white young mother   certain awe  had never entered into her feelings  diana before could this pale woman   rapture  her eyes   little blackcurled rosycheeked diana she had played   vanished schooldays it gave her  queer desolate feeling  she herself somehow belonged only  those past years  had no business   present  all “isn’t  perfectly beautiful” said diana proudly the little fat fellow  absurdly like fredjust  round just  red anne really could not say conscientiously  she thought him beautiful but she vowed sincerely    sweet  kissable  altogether delightful “before  came i wanted  girl so  i could call her anne” said diana “but now  little fred  here i wouldn’t exchange him   million girls he just couldn’t have been anything but his own precious self” “‘every little baby   sweetest   best’” quoted mrs allan gaily “if little anne had come you’d have felt just  same about her” mrs allan  visiting  avonlea   first time since leaving it she   gay  sweet  sympathetic  ever her old girl friends had welcomed her back rapturously the reigning minister’s wife   estimable lady but she  not exactly  kindred spirit “i can hardly wait till  gets old enough  talk” sighed diana “i just long  hear him say ‘mother’ and oh i’m determined  his first memory  me shall   nice one the first memory i have  my mother   her slapping me  something i had done i am sure i deserved it  mother  always  good mother  i love her dearly but i do wish my first memory  her  nicer” “i have just one memory  my mother     sweetest  all my memories” said mrs allan “i  five years old  i had been allowed  go  school one day  my two older sisters when school came out my sisters went home  different groups each supposing i    other instead i had run off   little girl i had played   recess we went  her home which  near  school  began making mud pies we  having  glorious time when my older sister arrived breathless  angry “‘you naughty girl” she cried snatching my reluctant hand  dragging me along  her ‘come home this minute oh you’re going  catch it mother  awful cross she  going  give you  good whipping’ “i had never been whipped dread  terror filled my poor little heart i have never been so miserable  my life  i    walk home i had not meant   naughty phemy cameron had asked me  go home  her  i had not known   wrong  go and now i    whipped  it when we got home my sister dragged me into  kitchen where mother  sitting   fire   twilight my poor wee legs  trembling so  i could hardly stand and mothermother just took me up  her arms without one word  rebuke or harshness kissed me  held me close  her heart ‘i  so frightened you  lost darling’ she said tenderly i could see  love shining  her eyes  she looked down  me she never scolded or reproached me  what i had doneonly told me i must never go away again without asking permission she died very soon afterwards that   only memory i have  her isn’t   beautiful one” anne felt lonelier than ever  she walked home going  way   birch path  willowmere she had not walked  way  many moons it   darklypurple bloomy night the air  heavy  blossom fragrancealmost too heavy the cloyed senses recoiled      overfull cup the birches   path had grown   fairy saplings  old  big trees everything had changed anne felt  she would  glad when  summer  over  she  away  work again perhaps life would not seem so empty then “‘i’ve tried  worldit wears no more the coloring  romance  wore’” sighed anneand  straightway much comforted   romance   idea   world being denuded  romance chapter xl a book  revelation the irvings came back  echo lodge   summer  anne spent  happy three weeks there  july miss lavendar had not changed charlotta  fourth   very grownup young lady now but still adored anne sincerely “when all’s said  done miss shirley ma’am i haven’t seen any one  boston that’s equal  you” she said frankly paul  almost grown up too he  sixteen his chestnut curls had given place  closecropped brown locks    more interested  football than fairies but  bond between him  his old teacher still held kindred spirits alone do not change  changing years it   wet bleak cruel evening  july when anne came back  green gables one   fierce summer storms which sometimes sweep over  gulf  ravaging  sea as anne came   first raindrops dashed against  panes “was  paul who brought you home” asked marilla “why didn’t you make him stay all night it’s going    wild evening” “he’ll reach echo lodge before  rain gets very heavy i think anyway  wanted  go back tonight well i’ve had  splendid visit but i’m glad  see you dear folks again ‘east west hame’s best’ davy have you been growing again lately” “i’ve growed  whole inch since you left” said davy proudly “i’m  tall  milty boulter now ain’t i glad he’ll have  stop crowing about being bigger say anne did you know  gilbert blythe  dying” anne stood quite silent  motionless looking  davy her face had gone so white  marilla thought she  going  faint “davy hold your tongue” said mrs rachel angrily “anne don’t look like thatdon’t look like that we didn’t mean  tell you so suddenly” “isittrue” asked anne   voice   not hers “gilbert  very ill” said mrs lynde gravely “he took down  typhoid fever just after you left  echo lodge did you never hear  it” “no” said  unknown voice “it   very bad case   start the doctor said he’d been terribly run down they’ve  trained nurse  everything’s been done don’t look like that anne while there’s life there’s hope” “mr harrison  here this evening   said they had no hope  him” reiterated davy marilla looking old  worn  tired got up  marched davy grimly out   kitchen “oh don’t look so dear” said mrs rachel putting her kind old arms about  pallid girl “i haven’t given up hope indeed i haven’t he’s got  blythe constitution  his favor that’s what” anne gently put mrs lynde’s arms away  her walked blindly across  kitchen through  hall up  stairs  her old room at  window she knelt down staring out unseeingly it  very dark the rain  beating down over  shivering fields the haunted woods  full   groans  mighty trees wrung   tempest   air throbbed   thunderous crash  billows   distant shore and gilbert  dying there   book  revelation  every one’s life  there    bible anne read hers  bitter night  she kept her agonized vigil through  hours  storm  darkness she loved gilberthad always loved him she knew  now she knew  she could no more cast him out  her life without agony than she could have cut off her right hand  cast   her and  knowledge had come too latetoo late even   bitter solace  being  him   last if she had not been so blindso foolishshe would have had  right  go  him now but  would never know  she loved himhe would go away  this life thinking  she did not care oh  black years  emptiness stretching before her she could not live through themshe could not she cowered down  her window  wished   first time  her gay young life  she could die too if gilbert went away  her without one word or sign or message she could not live nothing   any value without him she belonged  him    her in her hour  supreme agony she had no doubt  that he did not love christine stuartnever had loved christine stuart oh what  fool she had been not  realize what  bond   had held her  gilbertto think   flattered fancy she had felt  roy gardner had been love and now she must pay  her folly    crime mrs lynde  marilla crept  her door before they went  bed shook their heads doubtfully  each other over  silence  went away the storm raged all night but when  dawn came   spent anne saw  fairy fringe  light   skirts  darkness soon  eastern hilltops had  fireshot ruby rim the clouds rolled themselves away into great soft white masses   horizon  sky gleamed blue  silvery a hush fell over  world anne rose  her knees  crept downstairs the freshness   rainwind blew against her white face  she went out into  yard  cooled her dry burning eyes a merry rollicking whistle  lilting up  lane a moment later pacifique buote came  sight anne’s physical strength suddenly failed her if she had not clutched   low willow bough she would have fallen pacifique  george fletcher’s hired man  george fletcher lived next door   blythes mrs fletcher  gilbert’s aunt pacifique would know ififpacifique would know what there    known pacifique strode sturdily  along  red lane whistling he did not see anne she made three futile attempts  call him he  almost past before she succeeded  making her quivering lips call “pacifique” pacifique turned   grin   cheerful good morning “pacifique” said anne faintly “did you come  george fletcher’s this morning” “sure” said pacifique amiably “i got de word las’ night dat my fader   seeck it  so stormy dat i couldn’t go den so i start vair early dis mornin’ i’m goin’ troo de woods  short cut” “did you hear how gilbert blythe  this morning” anne’s desperation drove her   question even  worst would  more endurable than this hideous suspense “he’s better” said pacifique “he got de turn las’ night de doctor say he’ll  all right now dis soon while had close shave dough dat boy  jus’ keel himself  college well i mus’ hurry de old man he’ll   hurry  see me” pacifique resumed his walk  his whistle anne gazed after him  eyes where joy  driving out  strained anguish   night he   very lank very ragged very homely youth but  her sight    beautiful  those who bring good tidings   mountains never  long  she lived would anne see pacifique’s brown round blackeyed face without  warm remembrance   moment when  had given  her  oil  joy  mourning long after pacifique’s gay whistle had faded into  phantom  music  then into silence far up under  maples  lover’s lane anne stood under  willows tasting  poignant sweetness  life when some great dread  been removed  it the morning   cup filled  mist  glamor in  corner near her   rich surprise  newblown crystaldewed roses the trills  trickles  song   birds   big tree above her seemed  perfect accord  her mood a sentence   very old very true very wonderful book came  her lips “weeping may endure   night but joy cometh   morning” xli love takes up  glass  time “i’ve come up  ask you  go  one  our oldtime rambles through september woods  ‘over hills where spices grow’ this afternoon” said gilbert coming suddenly around  porch corner “suppose we visit hester gray’s garden” anne sitting   stone step  her lap full   pale filmy green stuff looked up rather blankly “oh i wish i could” she said slowly “but i really can’t gilbert i’m going  alice penhallow’s wedding this evening you know i’ve got  do something  this dress    time it’s finished i’ll have  get ready i’m so sorry i’d love  go” “well can you go tomorrow afternoon then” asked gilbert apparently not much disappointed “yes i think so” “in  case i shall hie me home  once  do something i should otherwise have  do tomorrow so alice penhallow    married tonight three weddings  you  one summer annephil’s alice’s  jane’s i’ll never forgive jane  not inviting me  her wedding” “you really can’t blame her when you think   tremendous andrews connection who had   invited the house could hardly hold them all i  only bidden  grace  being jane’s old chumat least  jane’s part i think mrs harmon’s motive  inviting me   let me see jane’s surpassing gorgeousness” “is  true  she wore so many diamonds  you couldn’t tell where  diamonds left off  jane began” anne laughed “she certainly wore  good many what  all  diamonds  white satin  tulle  lace  roses  orange blossoms prim little jane  almost lost  sight but she  very happy  so  mr inglisand so  mrs harmon” “is   dress you’re going  wear tonight” asked gilbert looking down   fluffs  frills “yes isn’t  pretty and i shall wear starflowers  my hair the haunted wood  full  them this summer” gilbert had  sudden vision  anne arrayed   frilly green gown   virginal curves  arms  throat slipping out  it  white stars shining against  coils  her ruddy hair the vision made him catch his breath but  turned lightly away “well i’ll  up tomorrow hope you’ll have  nice time tonight” anne looked after him   strode away  sighed gilbert  friendlyvery friendlyfar too friendly he had come quite often  green gables after his recovery  something  their old comradeship had returned but anne no longer found  satisfying the rose  love made  blossom  friendship pale  scentless  contrast and anne had again begun  doubt if gilbert now felt anything  her but friendship in  common light  common day her radiant certainty   rapt morning had faded she  haunted   miserable fear  her mistake could never  rectified it  quite likely    christine whom gilbert loved after all perhaps   even engaged  her anne tried  put all unsettling hopes out  her heart  reconcile herself   future where work  ambition must take  place  love she could do good if not noble work   teacher   success her little sketches  beginning  meet   certain editorial sanctums augured well  her budding literary dreams butbutanne picked up her green dress  sighed again when gilbert came  next afternoon  found anne waiting  him fresh   dawn  fair   star after all  gaiety   preceding night she wore  green dressnot  one she had worn   wedding but  old one which gilbert had told her   redmond reception  liked especially it  just  shade  green  brought out  rich tints  her hair   starry gray  her eyes   irislike delicacy  her skin gilbert glancing  her sideways  they walked along  shadowy woodpath thought she had never looked so lovely anne glancing sideways  gilbert now  then thought how much older  looked since his illness it   if  had put boyhood behind him forever the day  beautiful   way  beautiful anne  almost sorry when they reached hester gray’s garden  sat down   old bench but   beautiful there tooas beautiful   had been   faraway day   golden picnic when diana  jane  priscilla  she had found it then  had been lovely  narcissus  violets now golden rod had kindled  fairy torches   corners  asters dotted  bluely the call   brook came up through  woods   valley  birches  all  old allurement  mellow air  full   purr   sea beyond  fields rimmed  fences bleached silvery gray   suns  many summers  long hills scarfed   shadows  autumnal clouds   blowing   west wind old dreams returned “i think” said anne softly “that ‘the land where dreams come true’    blue haze yonder over  little valley” “have you any unfulfilled dreams anne” asked gilbert something  his tonesomething she had not heard since  miserable evening   orchard  patty’s placemade anne’s heart beat wildly but she made answer lightly “of course everybody has it wouldn’t do  us  have all our dreams fulfilled we would   good  dead if we had nothing left  dream about what  delicious aroma  lowdescending sun  extracting   asters  ferns i wish we could see perfumes  well  smell them i’m sure they would  very beautiful” gilbert  not   thus sidetracked “i have  dream”  said slowly “i persist  dreaming it although   often seemed  me   could never come true i dream   home   hearthfire  it  cat  dog  footsteps  friendsand you” anne wanted  speak but she could find no words happiness  breaking over her like  wave it almost frightened her “i asked you  question over two years ago anne if i ask  again today  you give me  different answer” still anne could not speak but she lifted her eyes shining  all  loverapture  countless generations  looked into his   moment he wanted no other answer they lingered   old garden until twilight sweet  dusk  eden must have been crept over it there  so much  talk over  recallthings said  done  heard  thought  felt  misunderstood “i thought you loved christine stuart” anne told him  reproachfully  if she had not given him every reason  suppose  she loved roy gardner gilbert laughed boyishly “christine  engaged  somebody  her home town i knew   she knew i knew it when her brother graduated  told me his sister  coming  kingsport  next winter  take music  asked me if i would look after her  bit  she knew no one  would  very lonely so i did and then i liked christine  her own sake she  one   nicest girls i’ve ever known i knew college gossip credited us  being  love  each other i didn’t care nothing mattered much  me   time there after you told me you could never love me anne there  nobody elsethere never could  anybody else  me but you i’ve loved you ever since  day you broke your slate over my head  school” “i don’t see how you could keep  loving me when i  such  little fool” said anne “well i tried  stop” said gilbert frankly “not because i thought you what you call yourself but because i felt sure there  no chance  me after gardner came   scene but i couldn’tand i can’t tell you either what it’s meant  me these two years  believe you  going  marry him   told every week  some busybody  your engagement    point  being announced i believed  until one blessed day when i  sitting up after  fever i got  letter  phil gordonphil blake ratherin which she told me there  really nothing between you  roy  advised me  ‘try again’ well  doctor  amazed  my rapid recovery after that” anne laughedthen shivered “i can never forget  night i thought you  dying gilbert oh i knewi knew thenand i thought   too late” “but  wasn’t sweetheart oh anne this makes up  everything doesn’t it let’s resolve  keep this day sacred  perfect beauty all our lives   gift   given us” “it’s  birthday  our happiness” said anne softly “i’ve always loved this old garden  hester gray’s  now    dearer than ever” “but i’ll have  ask you  wait  long time anne” said gilbert sadly “it   three years before i’ll finish my medical course and even then there   no diamond sunbursts  marble halls” anne laughed “i don’t want sunbursts  marble halls i just want you you see i’m quite  shameless  phil about it sunbursts  marble halls may  all very well but there  more ‘scope  imagination’ without them and    waiting  doesn’t matter we’ll just  happy waiting  working  each otherand dreaming oh dreams   very sweet now” gilbert drew her close  him  kissed her then they walked home together   dusk crowned king  queen   bridal
