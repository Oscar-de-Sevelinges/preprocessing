in  same month  february dawsons landing gained  new citizen this  mr david wilson  young fellow  scotch parentage he had wandered  this remote region  his birthplace   interior   state  new york  seek his fortune he  twentyfive years old collegebred  had finished  postcollege course   eastern law school  couple  years before he   homely freckled sandyhaired young fellow   intelligent blue eye  had frankness  comradeship     covert twinkle   pleasant sort but   unfortunate remark  his  would no doubt have entered  once upon  successful career  dawsons landing but  made his fatal remark  first day  spent   village   gaged him he had just made  acquaintance   group  citizens when  invisible dog began  yelp  snarl  howl  make himself very comprehensively disagreeable whereupon young

expression  they could read they fell away  him   something uncanny  went into privacy  discuss him one said pears    fool pears said another is i reckon you better say said  wished  owned half   dog  idiot said  third what did  reckon would become   other half if  killed his half do you reckon  thought  would live why  must have thought it unless    downrightest fool   world because if  hadnt thought it  would have wanted  own  whole dog knowing  if  killed his half   other half died  would  responsible   half just  same  if  had killed  half instead  his own dont  look  way  you gents yes  does if  owned one half   general dog  would  so if  owned one end   dog  another person owned  other end  would  so just  same particularly   first case because if you kill one half   general dog there aint any man  can tell whose half  was but if  owned one end   dog maybe  could kill his end   and no  couldnt either  couldnt  not  responsible if  other end died which  would in my opinion

laughs  said i thought i wouldnt say anything but if variety  what you  after you have wasted  piece  glass the handprint  one twin   same   handprint   fellowtwin well its done now  i like  have them

this town  dont know it wilson winced under this nagging  not very courteous chaff   twins suffered  him   him they rightly judged now   best way  relieve him would   take  thing  earnest  treat   respect ignoring toms rather overdone raillery so luigi said we have seen something  palmistry  our wanderings  know very well what astonishing things  can do if  isnt  science  one   greatest  them too i dont know what  other name ought  be in  orient tom looked surprised  incredulous he said that juggling  science but really you aint serious  you yes entirely so four years ago we had our hands read out  us  if our palms had been covered  print well do you mean  say there  actually anything  it asked tom his incredulity beginning  weaken  little there  this much  it said angelo what  told us  our characters  minutely exactwe could not have bettered  ourselves next two or three memorable things  had happened  us  laid barethings which no one present but ourselves could have known about why its rank sorcery exclaimed tom who  now becoming very much interested and how did they make out  what  going  happen  you   future on  whole quite fairly said luigi two or three   most striking things foretold have happened since much  most striking one  all happened within  same year some   minor prophecies have come true some   minor  some   major ones have not been fulfilled yet   course may never be still i should  more surprised if they failed  arrive than if they didnt tom  entirely sobered  profoundly impressed he said apologetically dave i wasnt meaning  belittle  science i  only chaffingchattering i reckon id better say i wish you would look  their palms come wont you why certainly if you want me to but you know ive had no chance  become  expert  dont claim   one when  past event  somewhat prominently recorded   palm i can generally detect that but minor ones often escape menot always  course but oftenbut i havent much confidence  myself when  comes  reading  future i am talking  if palmistry   daily study  me but   not so i havent examined half  dozen hands   last half dozen years you see  people got  joking about it  i stopped  let  talk die down ill tell you what well do count luigi ill make  try  your past  if i have any success thereno   whole ill let  future alone thats really  affair   expert he took luigis hand tom said waitdont look yet dave count luigi heres paper  pencil set down  thing  you said   most striking one   foretold  you  happened less than  year afterward  give   me so i can see if dave finds   your hand luigi wrote  line privately  folded up  piece  paper  handed   tom saying ill tell you when  look  it if  finds it wilson began  study luigis palm tracing life lines heart lines head lines  so on  noting carefully their relations   cobweb  finer  more delicate marks  lines  enmeshed them  all sides  felt   fleshy cushion   base   thumb  noted  shape  felt   fleshy side   hand between  wrist   base   little finger  noted  shape also  painstakingly examined  fingers observing their form proportions  natural manner  disposing themselves when  repose all this process  watched   three spectators  absorbing interest their heads bent together over luigis palm  nobody disturbing  stillness   word wilson now entered upon  close survey   palm again  his revelations began he mapped out luigis character  disposition his tastes aversions proclivities ambitions  eccentricities   way which sometimes made luigi wince   others laugh but both twins declared   chart  artistically drawn   correct next wilson took up luigis history he proceeded cautiously   hesitation now moving his finger slowly along  great lines   palm  now  then halting    star or some such landmark  examining  neighborhood minutely he proclaimed one or two past events luigi confirmed his correctness   search went on presently wilson glanced up suddenly   surprised expression here   record   incident which you would perhaps not wish me to bring  out said luigi goodnaturedly i promise you  shant embarrass me but wilson still hesitated  did not seem quite  know what  do then  said i think   too delicate  matter totoi believe i would rather write  or whisper   you  let you decide  yourself whether you want  talked out or not that  answer said luigi write it wilson wrote something   slip  paper  handed   luigi who read   himself  said  tom unfold your slip  read it mr driscoll tom read it  prophesied  i would kill  man it came true before  year  out tom added great scott luigi handed wilsons paper  tom  said now read this one tom read you have killed some one but whether man woman or child i do not make out cæsars ghost commented tom  astonishment it beats anything   ever heard of why  mans own hand  his deadliest enemy just think  thata mans own hand keeps  record   deepest  fatalest secrets  his life   treacherously ready  expose him  any blackmagic stranger  comes along but what do you let  person look  your hand for   awful thing printed  it oh said luigi reposefully i dont mind it i killed  man  good reasons  i dont regret it what   reasons well  needed killing ill tell you why  did it since  wont say himself said angelo warmly he did   save my life thats what  did  for so    noble act  not  thing   hid   dark so  was so  was said wilson to do such  thing  save  brothers life   great  fine action now come said luigi it  very pleasant  hear you say these things but  unselfishness or heroism or magnanimity  circumstances wont stand scrutiny you overlook one detail suppose i hadnt saved angelos life what would have become  mine if i had let  man kill him wouldnt  have killed me too i saved my own life you see yes   your way  talking said angelo but i know youi dont believe you thought  yourself  all i keep  weapon yet  luigi killed  man with  ill show   you sometime that incident makes  interesting   had  history before  came into luigis hands which adds   interest it  given  luigi   great indian prince

how  thing  done when  gave   luigi  before  night  ended luigi had used  knife   gaikowar   man short  reason  it the sheath  magnificently ornamented  gems  great value you  find  sheath more worth looking  than  knife itself  course tom said  himself its lucky i came here i would have sold  knife   song i supposed  jewels  glass but go on dont stop said wilson our curiosity  up now  hear about

doubt luigi had  under his pillow we   bed together there   dim nightlight burning i  asleep but luigi  awake   thought  detected  vague form nearing  bed he slipped  knife out   sheath   ready  unembarrassed  hampering bedclothes   weather  hot  we hadnt any suddenly  native rose   bedside  bent over me  his right hand lifted   dirk   aimed  my throat but luigi grabbed his wrist pulled him

toward all  three witnesses  his exhibition  fact  felt so annoyed  them  having witnessed   noticed    almost forgot  feel annoyed  himself  placing  before them however something presently happened which made him almost comfortable  brought him nearly back   state  charity  friendliness this   little spat between  twins not much   spat but still  spat  before they got far   they    decided

silence followed which lasted some moments then wilson said theres one good thing anyway she cant either pawn or sell count luigis costly indian dagger my said tom is  gone yes well    haul but why

throw any light   matter nearly  week had drifted by  still  thing remained  vexed mystery on saturday constable blake  puddnhead wilson met   street  tom driscoll joined them  time  open their conversation  them he said  blakeyou  not looking well blake you seem   annoyed about something has anything gone wrong   detective business i believe you fairly  justifiably claim  have  pretty good reputation   line isnt  sowhich made blake feel good  look it but tom added for  country detectivewhich made blake feel  other way  not only look it but betray   his voice yes sir i have got  reputation  its  good  anybodys   profession too country or no country oh i beg pardon i didnt mean any offense what i started out  ask  only about  old woman  raided  townthe stoopshouldered old woman you know  you said you  going  catch  i knew you would too because you have  reputation  never boasting andwell youyouve caught  old woman d  old woman why sho you dont mean  say you havent caught her no i havent caught her if anybody could have caught her i could but nobody couldnt i dont care who  is i am sorry real sorryfor your sake because when  gets around   detective  expressed himself so confidently  then dont you worry thats alldont you worry     town  town neednt worry either shes my meatmake yourself easy about that im  her track ive got clues that thats good now if you could get  old veteran detective down  st louis  help you find out what  clues mean  where they lead to  then im plenty veteran enough myself  i dont need anybodys help ill have her inside   weinside   month that ill swear to tom said carelessly i suppose   answeryes   answer but i reckon she  pretty old  old people dont often outlive  cautious pace   professional detective when   got his clues together   out  his stillhunt blakes dull face flushed under this gibe but before  could set his retort  order tom had turned  wilson   saying  placid indifference  manner  voice who got  reward puddnhead wilson winced slightly  saw  his own turn  come what reward why  reward   thief   other one   knife wilson answeredand rather uncomfortably  judge  his hesitating fashion  delivering himself well thewell  fact nobody  claimed  yet tom seemed surprised why   so wilson showed  trifle  irritation when  replied yes its so and what  it oh nothing only i thought you had struck out  new idea  invented  scheme   going  revolutionize  timeworn  ineffectual methods  the he stopped  turned  blake who  happy now  another had taken his place   gridiron blake didnt you understand him  intimate   wouldnt  necessary  you  hunt  old woman down bgeorge  said hed have thief  swag both inside  three dayshe did  hokey  thats just about  week ago why i said   time  no thief  no thiefs pal  going  try  pawn or sell  thing where  knowed  pawnbroker could get both rewards  taking him into camp   swag it   blessedest idea  ever i struck youd change your mind said wilson  irritated bluntness if you knew  entire scheme instead  only part  it well said  constable pensively i had  idea   wouldnt work  up  now im right anyway very well then let  stand  that  give   further show it  worked  least  well  your own methods you perceive the constable hadnt anything handy  hit back with so  discharged  discontented sniff  said nothing after  night  wilson had partly revealed his scheme  his house tom had tried  several days  guess out  secret   rest  it but had failed then  occurred  him  give roxanas smarter head  chance  it he made up  supposititious case  laid  before her she thought  over  delivered her verdict upon it tom said  himself shes hit it sure he thought  would test  verdict now  watch wilsons face so  said reflectively wilson youre not  foola fact  recent discovery whatever your scheme was  had sense  it blakes opinion   contrary notwithstanding i dont ask you  reveal it but i  suppose  casea case which  answer   startingpoint   real thing i am going  come at  thats all i want you offered five hundred dollars   knife  five hundred   thief we  suppose  arguments sake   first reward  advertised   second offered  private letter  pawnbrokers and blake slapped his thigh  cried out by jackson hes got you puddnhead now why couldnt i or any fool have thought  that wilson said  himself anybody   reasonably good head would have thought  it i am not surprised  blake didnt detect it i am only surprised  tom did there  more  him than i supposed he said nothing aloud  tom went on very well the thief would not suspect  there   trap   would bring or send  knife  say  bought    song or found    road or something like that  try  collect  reward   arrestedwouldnt he yes said wilson i think so said tom there cant  any doubt  it have you ever seen  knife no has any friend  yours not  i know of well i begin  think i understand why your scheme failed what do you mean tom what  you driving at asked wilson   dawning sense  discomfort why  there isnt any such knife look here wilson said blake tom driscolls right   thousand dollarsif i had it wilsons blood warmed  little   wondered if  had been played upon  those strangers  certainly had something   look but what could they gain  it he threw out  suggestion tom replied gain oh nothing  you would value maybe but they  strangers making their way   new community is  nothing  them  appear  pets   oriental princeat no expense is  nothing  them   able  dazzle this poor little town  thousanddollar rewardsat no expense wilson there isnt any such knife or your scheme would have fetched   light or if there  any such knife theyve got  yet i believe myself  theyve seen such  knife  angelo pictured  out  his pencil too swiftly  handily  him  have been inventing it   course i cant swear  theyve never had it but this ill go bail forif they had  when they came  this town theyve got  yet blake said it looks mighty reasonable  way tom puts it  most certainly does tom responded turning  leave you find  old woman blake  if she cant furnish  knife go  search  twins tom sauntered away wilson felt  good deal depressed he hardly knew what  think he  loath  withdraw his faith   twins   resolved not  do    present indecisive evidence butwell  would think  then decide how  act blake what do you think  this matter well puddnhead im bound  say i put  up  way tom does they hadnt  knife or if they had it theyve got  yet the men parted wilson said  himself i believe they had it if  had been stolen  scheme would have restored it   certain and so i believe theyve got  yet tom had no purpose  his mind when  encountered those two men when  began his talk  hoped   able  gall them  little  get  trifle  malicious entertainment out  it but when  left  left  great spirits   perceived  just  pure luck  no troublesome labor  had accomplished several delightful things  had touched both men   raw spot  seen them squirm  had modified wilsons sweetness   twins  one small bitter taste   wouldnt  able  get out  his mouth right away and best  all  had taken  hated twins down  peg   community  blake would gossip around freely after  manner  detectives  within  week  town would  laughing  them   sleeve  offering  gaudy reward   bauble which they either never possessed or hadnt lost tom  very well satisfied  himself toms behavior  home had been perfect during  entire week his uncle  aunt had seen nothing like  before they could find no fault  him anywhere saturday evening  said   judge ive had something preying  my mind uncle   i am going away  might never see you again i cant bear  any longer

knowing what i knew about him indeed what  that count luigi   confessed assassin incredible its perfectly true wilson detected   his hand  palmistry  charged him  it  cornered him up so close   had  confess but both twins begged us  their knees  keep  secret  swore they would lead straight lives here    all so pitiful  we gave our word  honor never  expose them while they kept  promise you would have done  yourself uncle you  right my boy i would a mans secret  still his own property  sacred when   been surprised out  him like that you did well  i am proud  you then  added mournfully but i wish i could have been saved  shame  meeting  assassin   field  honor it couldnt  helped uncle if i had known you  going  challenge him i should have felt obliged  sacrifice my pledged word  order  stop it but wilson couldnt  expected  do otherwise than keep silent oh no wilson did right    no way  blame tom tom you have lifted  heavy load  my heart i  stung   very soul when i seemed  have discovered  i had  coward  my family you may imagine what  cost me  assume such  part uncle oh i know it poor boy i know it and i can understand how much   cost you  remain under  unjust stigma  this time but   all right now  no harm  done you have restored my comfort  mind    your own  both  us had suffered enough the old man sat awhile plunged  thought then  looked up   satisfied light  his eye  said that this assassin should have put  affront upon me  letting me meet him   field  honor  if    gentleman   matter which i  presently settlebut not now i  not shoot him until after election i see

thought   mysterious girl  once but this  not  sort  work   girl   engaged in no matter tom driscolls room must  examined after  coroners jury had viewed  body   surroundings wilson suggested  search upstairs   went along the jury forced  entrance  toms room but found nothing  course the coroners jury found   homicide  committed  luigi   angelo  accessory  it the town  bitter against  unfortunates

 gone too it  true   had really been revived   now discovered but tom could not have been aware  it or  would have spoken  it  his native talky unsecretive way finally tom   st louis when  murder  done  got  news out   morning journals   shown  his telegram  his aunt these speculations  unemphasized sensations rather than articulated thoughts  wilson would have laughed   idea  seriously connecting tom   murder wilson regarded  case   twins  desperatein fact about hopeless for  argued  if  confederate  not found  enlightened missouri jury would hang them sure if  confederate  found

uneasiness his being  nature sensitive  even  smallest alarms but   moment   poverty  weakness  wilsons case lay exposed   court   comfortable once more even jubilant he left  courtroom sarcastically sorry  wilson the clarksons met  unknown woman   back lane  said  himselfthat  his case ill give him  century  find her ina couple  them if  likes a woman who doesnt exist any longer   clothes  gave her her sex burnt up   ashes thrown awayoh certainly hell find her easy enough this reflection set him  admiring   hundredth time  shrewd ingenuities  which  had insured himself against detectionmore against even suspicion nearly always  cases like this there  some little detail or other overlooked some wee little track or trace left behind  detection follows but here theres not even  faintest

suddenly out  his face his hand quaked   gazed   polished surface before him   glassy stare   corpse great heavens whats  matter  you wilson are you going  faint tom sprang   glass  water  offered it but wilson shrank shuddering  him  said no notake  away his breast  rising  falling   moved his head about   dull  wandering way like  person who had been stunned presently  said i shall feel better when i get  bed i have been overwrought today yes  over worked  many days then ill leave you  let you  get  your rest goodnight old man but  tom went out  couldnt deny himself  small parting gibe dont

at last  put them down  said i cant make  out  allhang it  babys dont tally   others he walked  floor  half  hour puzzling over his enigma then  hunted out two other glass plates he sat down  puzzled over these things  good while but kept muttering its no use i cant understand it they dont tally right  yet ill swear  names  dates  right  so  course they ought  tally i never labeled one  these thing carelessly  my life there   most extraordinary mystery here he  tired out now  his brains  beginning  clog he said  would sleep himself fresh  then see what  could do  this riddle he slept

offer  my justification  this  i did not discover  existence until late last night  have been engaged  examining  classifying  ever since until half  hour ago i shall offer  presently but first i wish  say  few preliminary words may  please  court  claim given  front place  claim most persistently urged  claim most strenuously  i may even say aggressively  defiantly insisted upon   prosecution  thisthat  person whose hand left  bloodstained fingerprints upon  handle   indian knife   person who committed  murder wilson paused during several moments  give impressiveness  what   about  say  then added tranquilly we grant  claim it   electrical surprise no one  prepared  such  admission a buzz  astonishment rose  all sides  people  heard  intimate   overworked lawyer had lost his mind even  veteran judge accustomed     legal ambushes  masked batteries  criminal procedure  not sure  his ears  not deceiving him  asked counsel what    had said howards impassive face betrayed no sign

palms  fingerballs went down now all slouching forms straightened all heads came up all eyes  fastened upon wilsons face he waited yet one two three moments  let his pause complete  perfect  spell upon  house then when through  profound hush  could hear  ticking   clock   wall  put out his hand  took  indian knife   blade  held  aloft where all could see  sinister spots upon  ivory handle then

right he resumed his speech for more than twenty years i have amused my compulsory leisure  collecting these curious physical signatures  this town at my house i have hundreds upon hundreds  them each  every one  labelled  name  date not labelled  next day or even  next hour but   very minute   impression  taken when i go upon  witness stand i  repeat under oath  things which i am now saying i have
