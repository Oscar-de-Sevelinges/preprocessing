nightwind   flowers stood gazing  very wonder   little elves who lay among  fernleaves swung   vineboughs sailed   lake  lily cups or danced   mossy ground   music   harebells who rung out their merriest peal  honor   night under  shade   wild rose sat  queen  her little maids  honor beside  silvery mushroom where  feast  spread “now my friends” said she “to while away  time till  bright moon goes down let us each tell  tale or relate what we have done or learned this day i  begin  you sunny lock” added she turning   lovely little elf who lay among  fragrant leaves   primrose with  gay smile “sunny lock” began her story “as i  painting  bright petals   blue bell  told me this tale” the frostking or the power of love three little fairies sat   fields eating their breakfast each among  leaves  her favorite flower daisy primrose  violet  happy  elves need be the morning wind gently rocked them   fro   sun shone warmly down upon  dewy grass where butterflies spread their gay wings  bees  their deep voices sung among  flowers while  little birds hopped merrily about  peep  them on  silvery mushroom  spread  breakfast little cakes  flowerdust lay   broad green leaf beside  crimson strawberry which  sugar   violet  cream   yellow milkweed made  fairy meal  their drink   dew   flowers’ bright leaves “ah me” sighed primrose throwing herself languidly back “how warm  sun grows give me another piece  strawberry  then i must hasten away   shadow   ferns but while i eat tell me dear violet why  you all so sad i have scarce seen  happy face since my return  rose land dear friend what means it” “i  tell you” replied little violet  tears gathering  her soft eyes “our good queen  ever striving  keep  dear flowers   power   cruel frostking many ways she tried but all have failed she  sent messengers  his court  costly gifts but all have returned sick  want  sunlight weary  sad we have watched over them heedless  sun or shower but still his dark spirits do their work  we  left  weep over our blighted blossoms thus have we striven   vain  this night our queen holds council   last time therefore  we sad dear primrose  she  toiled  cared  us  we can do nothing  help or advise

getting i have my locks  curl  my robe  prepare   evening therefore i must  gone or i shall  brown   withered leaf  this warm light” so gathering  tiny mushroom   parasol she flew away daisy soon followed  violet  left alone then she spread  table afresh    came fearlessly  busy ant  bee gay butterfly  bird even  poor blind mole  humble worm  not forgotten   gentle words she gave  all while each learned something  their kind little teacher   love  made her own heart bright shone alike  all the ant  bee learned generosity  butterfly  bird contentment  mole  worm confidence   love  others  each went  their home better   little time they had been  violet evening came    troops  elves  counsel their good queen who seated  her mossy throne looked anxiously upon  throng below whose glittering wings  rustling robes gleamed like manycolored flowers at length she rose  amid  deep silence spoke thus— “dear children let us not tire   good work hard though    wearisome think   many little hearts   their sorrow look  us  help what would  green earth  without  lovely flowers  what  lonely home  us their beauty fills our hearts  brightness  their love  tender thoughts ought we then  leave them  die uncared   alone they give  us their all ought we not  toil unceasingly  they may bloom  peace within their quiet homes we have tried  gain  love   stern frostking but  vain his heart  hard  his own icy land no love can melt no kindness bring  back  sunlight   joy how then may we keep our frail blossoms  his cruel spirits who  give us counsel who   our messenger   last time speak my subjects” then  great murmuring arose  many spoke some  costlier gifts some  war   fearful counselled patience  submission long  eagerly they spoke  their soft voices rose high then sweet music sounded   air   loud tones  hushed   wondering silence  fairies waited what should come through  crowd there came  little form  wreath  pure white violets lay among  bright locks  fell so softly round  gentle face where  deep blush glowed as kneeling   throne little violet said— “dear queen we have bent   frostking’s power we have borne gifts unto his pride but have we gone trustingly  him  spoken fearlessly  his evil deeds have we shed  soft light  unwearied love around his cold heart   patient tenderness shown him how bright  beautiful love can make even  darkest lot “our messengers have gone fearfully   cold looks  courtly words offered him rich gifts things  cared not for   equal pride   sent them back “then let me  weakest  your band go  him trusting   love i know lies hidden   coldest heart “i  bear only  garland  our fairest flowers these  i wind about him  their bright faces looking lovingly  his  bring sweet thoughts  his dark mind  their soft breath steal  like gentle words then when  sees them fading  his breast   not sigh  there  no warmth there  keep them fresh  lovely this  i do dear queen  never leave his dreary home till  sunlight falls  flowers fair  those  bloom  our own dear land” silently  queen had listened but now rising  placing her hand  little violet’s head she said turning   throng below— “we  our pride  power have erred while this  weakest  lowliest  our subjects    innocence  her own pure heart counselled us more wisely than  noblest  our train all who  aid our brave little messenger lift your wands  we may know who  place their trust   power  love” every fairy wand glistened   air   silvery voices they cried “love  little violet” then down   throne hand  hand came  queen  violet  till  moon sank did  fairies toil  weave  wreath   fairest flowers tenderly they gathered them   nightdew fresh upon their leaves   they wove chanted sweet spells  whispered fairy blessings   bright messengers whom they sent forth  die   dreary land  their gentle kindred might bloom unharmed at length   done   fair flowers lay glowing   soft starlight while beside them stood  fairies singing   music   windharps— we  sending you dear flowers forth alone  die where your gentle sisters may not weep o’er  cold graves where you lie but you go  bring them fadeless life in  bright homes where they dwell and you softly smile  ’t  so as we sadly sing farewell o plead  gentle words  us and whisper tenderly of generous love   cold heart and   answer ye and though you fade   dreary home yet loving hearts  tell of  joy  peace  you have given flowers dear flowers farewell” the morning sun looked softly down upon  broad green earth which like  mighty altar  sending up clouds  perfume   breast while flowers danced gayly   summer wind  birds sang their morning hymn among  cool green leaves then high above  shining wings soared  little form the sunlight rested softly   silken hair   winds fanned lovingly  bright face  brought  sweetest odors  cheer her on thus went violet through  clear air   earth looked smiling up  her as   bright wreath folded  her arms she flew among  soft white clouds on   she went over hill  valley broad rivers  rustling woods till  warm sunlight passed away  winds grew cold   air thick  falling snow then far below she saw  frostking’s home pillars  hard gray ice supported  high arched roof hung  crystal icicles dreary gardens lay around filled  withered flowers  bare drooping trees while heavy clouds hung low   dark sky   cold wind murmured sadly through  wintry air with  beating heart violet folded her fading wreath more closely  her breast   weary wings flew onward   dreary palace here before  closed doors stood many forms  dark faces  harsh discordant voices who sternly asked  shivering little fairy why she came  them gently she answered telling them her errand beseeching them  let her pass ere  cold wind blighted her frail blossoms then they flung wide  doors  she passed in walls  ice carved  strange figures  around her glittering icicles hung   high roof  soft white snow covered  hard floors on  throne hung  clouds sat  frostking  crown  crystals bound his white locks   dark mantle wrought  delicate frostwork  folded over his cold breast his stern face could not stay little violet   through  long hall she went heedless   snow  gathered  her feet   bleak wind  blew around her while  king  wondering eyes looked   golden light  played upon  dark walls  she passed the flowers  if they knew their part unfolded their bright leaves  poured forth their sweetest perfume as kneeling   throne  brave little fairy said— “o king  blight  sorrow send me not away till i have brought back  light  joy   make your dark home bright  beautiful again let me call back   desolate gardens  fair forms   gone  their soft voices blessing you  bring  your breast  never failing joy cast  your icy crown  sceptre  let  sunlight  love fall softly  your heart “then   earth bloom again  all  beauty  your dim eyes  rest only  fair forms while music shall sound through these dreary halls   love  grateful hearts  yours have pity   gentle flowerspirits  do not doom them   early death when they might bloom  fadeless beauty making us wiser  their gentle teachings   earth brighter  their lovely forms these fair flowers   prayers  all fairy land i lay before you o send me not away till they  answered” and  tears falling thick  fast upon their tender leaves violet laid  wreath  his feet while  golden light grew ever brighter   fell upon  little form so humbly kneeling there the king’s stern face grew milder   gazed   gentle fairy   flowers seemed  look beseechingly upon him while their fragrant voices sounded softly  his ear telling  their dying sisters    joy  gives  bring happiness   weak  sorrowing but  drew  dark mantle closer over his breast  answered coldly— “i cannot grant your prayer little fairy   my   flowers should die go back  your queen  tell her  i cannot yield my power  please these foolish flowers” then violet hung  wreath above  throne   weary foot went forth again out into  cold dark gardens  still  golden shadows followed her  wherever they fell flowers bloomed  green leaves rustled then came  frostspirits  beneath their cold wings  flowers died while  spirits bore violet   low dark cell saying  they left her  their king  angry  she had dared  stay when  had bid her go so all alone she sat  sad thoughts  her happy home came back  her  she wept bitterly but soon came visions   gentle flowers dying  their forest homes  their voices ringing  her ear imploring her  save them then she wept no longer but patiently awaited what might come soon  golden light gleamed faintly through  cell  she heard little voices calling  help  high up among  heavy cobwebs hung poor little flies struggling  free themselves while their cruel enemies sat  their nets watching their pain with her wand  fairy broke  bands  held them tenderly bound up their broken wings  healed their wounds while they lay   warm light  feebly hummed their thanks  their kind deliverer then she went   ugly brown spiders   gentle words told them how  fairy land their kindred spun all  elfin cloth   return  fairies gave them food  then how happily they lived among  green leaves spinning garments  their neighbors “and you too” said she “shall spin  me  i  give you better food than helpless insects you shall live  peace  spin your delicate threads into  mantle   stern king  i  weave golden threads amid  gray  when folded over his cold heart gentle thoughts may enter   make  their home” and while she gayly sung  little weavers spun their silken threads  flies  glittering wings flew lovingly above her head  over all  golden light shone softly down when  frostspirits told their king  greatly wondered  often stole  look   sunny little room where friends  enemies worked peacefully together still  light grew brighter  floated out into  cold air where  hung like bright clouds above  dreary gardens whence all  spirits’ power could not drive it  green leaves budded   naked trees  flowers bloomed but  spirits heaped snow upon them  they bowed their heads  died at length  mantle  finished  amid  gray threads shone golden ones making  bright  she sent    king entreating him  wear it   would bring peace  love  dwell within his breast but  scornfully threw  aside  bade his spirits take her   colder cell deep   earth  there  harsh words they left her still she sang gayly on   falling drops kept time so musically   king  his cold icehalls wondered   low sweet sounds  came stealing up  him thus violet dwelt  each day  golden light grew stronger   among  crevices   rocky walls came troops  little velvetcoated moles praying  they might listen   sweet music  lie   warm light “we lead” said they “a dreary life   cold earth  flowerroots  dead  no soft dews descend  us  drink no little seed or leaf can we find ah good fairy let us  your servants give us but  few crumbs  your daily bread  we  do all  our power  serve you” and violet said yes so day after day they labored  make  pathway through  frozen earth  she might reach  roots   withered flowers  soon wherever through  dark galleries she went  soft light fell upon  roots  flowers  they  new life spread forth   warm ground  forced fresh sap   blossoms above brightly they bloomed  danced   soft light   frostspirits tried  vain  harm them  when they came beneath  bright clouds their power  do evil left them from his dark castle  king looked out   happy flowers who nodded gayly  him   sweet colors strove  tell him   good little spirit who toiled so faithfully below  they might live and when  turned   brightness without  his stately palace  seemed so cold  dreary   folded violet’s mantle round him  sat beneath  faded wreath upon his icecarved throne wondering   strange warmth  came  it till  length  bade his spirits bring  little fairy  her dismal prison soon they came hastening back  prayed him  come  see how lovely  dark cell had grown the rough floor  spread  deep green moss  over wall  roof grew flowery vines filling  air  their sweet breath while above played  clear soft light casting rosy shadows   glittering drops  lay among  fragrant leaves  beneath  vines stood violet casting crumbs   downy little moles who ran fearlessly about  listened  she sang  them when  old king saw how much fairer she had made  dreary cell than his palace rooms gentle thoughts within whispered him  grant her prayer  let  little fairy go back  her friends  home but  frostspirits breathed upon  flowers  bid him see how frail they were  useless   king then  stern cold thoughts came back again   harshly bid her follow him with  sad farewell  her little friends she followed him  before  throne awaited his command when  king saw how pale  sad  gentle face had grown how thin her robe  weak her wings  yet how lovingly  golden shadows fell around her  brightened  they lay upon  wand which guided  patient love had made his once desolate home so bright  could not  cruel   one who had done so much  him   kindly tone  said— “little fairy i offer you two things  you may choose between them if i  vow never more  harm  flowers you may love  you go back  your own people  leave me  my spirits  work our   all  other flowers  bloom the earth  broad  we can find them  any land then why should you care what happens  their kindred if your own  safe will you do this” “ah” answered violet sadly “do you not know  beneath  flowers’ bright leaves there beats  little heart  loves  sorrows like our own and can i heedless  their beauty doom them  pain  grief  i might save my own dear blossoms   cruel foes  which i leave them ah no sooner would i dwell  ever  your darkest cell than lose  love  those warm trusting hearts” “then listen” said  king “to  task i give you you shall raise up  me  palace fairer than this  if you can work  miracle i  grant your prayer or lose my kingly crown and now go forth  begin your task my spirits shall not harm you  i  wait till   done before i blight another flower” then out into  gardens went violet   heavy heart  she had toiled so long her strength  nearly gone but  flowers whispered their gratitude  folded their leaves  if they blessed her  when she saw  garden filled  loving friends who strove  cheer  thank her  her care courage  strength returned  raising up thick clouds  mist  hid her   wondering flowers alone  trustingly she began her work as time went by  frostking feared  task had been too hard   fairy sounds  heard behind  walls  mist bright shadows seen  pass within but  little voice  never heard meanwhile  golden light had faded   garden  flowers bowed their heads  all  dark  cold  when  gentle fairy came and   stern king his home seemed more desolate  sad   missed  warm light  happy flowers and more than all  gay voice  bright face  little violet so  wandered through his dreary palace wondering how  had been content  live before without sunlight  love and little violet  mourned  dead  fairyland  many tears  shed   gentle fairy  beloved  all   queen down   humblest flower sadly they watched over every bird  blossom which she had loved  strove   like her  kindly words  deeds they wore cypress wreaths  spoke  her  one whom they should never see again thus they dwelt  deepest sorrow till one day there came  them  unknown messenger wrapped   dark mantle who looked  wondering eyes   bright palace  flowercrowned elves who kindly welcomed him  brought fresh dew  rosy fruit  refresh  weary stranger then  told them   came   frostking who begged  queen  all her subjects  come  see  palace little violet had built   veil  mist would soon  withdrawn   she could not make  fairer home than  icecastle  king wished her kindred near  comfort   bear her home and while  elves wept  told them how patiently she had toiled how her fadeless love had made  dark cell bright  beautiful these  many other things  told them  little violet had won  love  many   frostspirits  even when they killed  flowers she had toiled so hard  bring  life  beauty she spoke gentle words  them  sought  teach them how beautiful  love long stayed  messenger  deeper grew his wonder   fairy could have left so fair  home  toil   dreary palace  his cruel master  suffer cold  weariness  give life  joy   weak  sorrowing when  elves had promised they would come  bade farewell  happy fairyland  flew sadly home at last  time arrived  out  his barren garden under  canopy  dark clouds sat  frostking before  misty wall behind which  heard low sweet sounds   rustling trees  warbling birds soon through  air came manycolored troops  elves first  queen known   silver lilies  her snowy robe   bright crown  her hair beside whom flew  band  elves  crimson  gold making sweet music  their flowertrumpets while all around  smiling faces  bright eyes fluttered her loving subjects on they came like  flock  brilliant butterflies their shining wings  manycolored garments sparkling   dim air  soon  leafless trees  gay  living flowers  their sweet voices filled  gardens  music like his subjects  king looked   lovely elves  no longer wondered  little violet wept  longed  her home darker  more desolate seemed his stately home  when  fairies asked  flowers  felt ashamed   had none  give them at length  warm wind swept through  gardens   mistclouds passed away while  silent wonder looked  frostking   elves upon  scene before them far  eye could reach  tall green trees whose drooping boughs made graceful arches through which  golden light shone softly making bright shadows   deep green moss below where  fairest flowers waved   cool wind  sang  their low sweet voices how beautiful  love flowering vines folded their soft leaves around  trees making green pillars  their rough trunks fountains threw their bright waters   roof  flocks  silverwinged birds flew singing among  flowers or brooded lovingly above their nests doves  gentle eyes cooed among  green leaves snowwhite clouds floated   sunny sky   golden light brighter than before shone softly down soon through  long aisles came violet flowers  green leaves rustling  she passed on she went   frostking’s throne bearing two crowns one  sparkling icicles  other  pure white lilies  kneeling before him said— “my task  done and thanks   spirits  earth  air i have made  fair  home  elfin hands can form you must now decide will you  king  flowerland  own my gentle kindred  your loving friends will you possess unfading peace  joy   grateful love  all  green earth’s fragrant children then take this crown  flowers but if you can find no pleasure here go back  your own cold home  dwell  solitude  darkness where no ray  sunlight or  joy can enter “send forth your spirits  carry sorrow  desolation over  happy earth  win  yourself  fear  hatred  those who would so gladly love  reverence you then take this glittering crown hard  cold  your own heart  be if you  shut out all   bright  beautiful both  before you choose” the old king looked   little fairy  saw how lovingly  bright shadows gathered round her  if  shield her  every harm  timid birds nestled  her bosom   flowers grew fairer  she looked upon them while her gentle friends  tears  their bright eyes folded their hands beseechingly  smiled  her kind thought came thronging  his mind   turned  look   two palaces violet’s so fair  beautiful   rustling trees calm sunny skies  happy birds  flowers all created  her patient love  care his own so cold  dark  dreary his empty gardens where no flowers could bloom no green trees dwell or gay birds sing all desolate  dim—and while  gazed his own spirits casting off their dark mantles knelt before him  besought him not  send them forth  blight  things  gentle fairies loved so much “we have served you long  faithfully” said they “give us now our freedom  we may learn   beloved   sweet flowers we have harmed so long grant  little fairy’s prayer  let her go back  her own dear home she  taught us  love  mightier than fear choose  flower crown  we    truest subjects you have ever had” then amid  burst  wild sweet music  frostking placed  flower crown  his head  knelt  little violet while far  near over  broad green earth sounded  voices  flowers singing their thanks   gentle fairy   summer wind  laden  perfumes which they sent  tokens  their gratitude  wherever she went old trees bent down  fold their slender branches round her flowers laid their soft faces against her own  whispered blessings even  humble moss bent over  little feet  kissed them  they passed the old king surrounded   happy fairies sat  violet’s lovely home  watched his icy castle melt away beneath  bright sunlight while his spirits cold  gloomy no longer danced   elves  waited  their king  loving eagerness brighter grew  golden light gayer sang  birds   harmonious voices  grateful flowers sounding over  earth carried new joy  all their gentle kindred brighter shone  golden shadows on  cool wind softly came the low sweet tones  happy flowers singing little violet’s name ’mong  green trees   whispered and  bright waves bore   to  lonely forest flowers where  glad news had not gone thus  frostking lost his kingdom and his power  harm  blight violet conquered  his cold heart warmed  music love  light and his fair home once so dreary gay  lovely elves  flowers brought  joy  never faded through  long bright summer hours thus  violet’s magic power all dark shadows passed away and o’er  home  happy flowers the golden light  ever lay thus  fairy mission ended and all flowerland  taught the “power  love”  gentle deeds that little violet wrought as sunny lock ceased another little elf came forward  this   tale “silver wing” told eva’s visit to fairyland down among  grass  fragrant clover lay little eva   brookside watching  bright waves  they went singing  under  drooping flowers  grew   banks as she  wondering where  waters went she heard  faint low sound   faroff music she thought    wind but not  leaf  stirring  soon through  rippling water came  strange little boat it   lily   valley whose tall stem formed  mast while  broad leaves  rose   roots  drooped again till they reached  water  filled  gay little elves who danced   music   silver lilybells above  rang  merry peal  filled  air  their fragrant breath on came  fairy boat till  reached  mossgrown rock  here  stopped while  fairies rested beneath  violetleaves  sang   dancing waves eva looked  wonder  their gay faces  bright garments    joy  her heart sang too  threw crimson fruit   little folks  feast upon they looked kindly   child and after whispering long among themselves two little brighteyed elves flew over  shining water and lighting   cloverblossoms said gently “little maiden many thanks  your kindness  our queen bids us ask if you  go  us  fairyland  learn what we can teach you” “gladly would i go  you dear fairies” said eva “but i cannot sail  your little boat see i can hold you  my hand  could not live among you without harming your tiny kingdom i am so large” then  elves laughed gayly  they folded their arms about her saying “you   good child dear eva  fear doing harm  those weaker than yourself you cannot hurt us now look   water  see what we have done” eva looked into  brook  saw  tiny child standing between  elves “now i can go  you” said she “but see i can no longer step   bank  yonder stone   brook seems now like  great river  you have not given me wings like yours” but  fairies took each  hand  flew lightly over  stream the queen  her subjects came  meet her  all seemed glad  say some kindly word  welcome   little stranger they placed  flowercrown upon her head laid their soft faces against her own  soon  seemed  if  gentle elves had always been her friends “now must we go home” said  queen “and you shall go  us little one” then there   great bustle  they flew about  shining wings some laying cushions  violet leaves   boat others folding  queen’s veil  mantle more closely round her lest  falling dews should chill her the cool waves’ gentle plashing against  boat   sweet chime   lilybells lulled little eva  sleep  when she woke    fairyland a faint rosy light    setting sun shone   white pillars   queen’s palace  they passed in   sleeping flowers leaned gracefully  their stems dreaming beneath their soft green curtains all  cool  still   elves glided silently about lest they should break their slumbers they led eva   bed  pure white leaves above which drooped  fragrant petals   crimson rose “you can look   bright colors till  light fades  then  rose  sing you  sleep” said  elves  they folded  soft leaves about her gently kissed her  stole away long she lay watching  bright shadows  listening   song   rose while through  long night dreams  lovely things floated like bright clouds through her mind while  rose bent lovingly above her  sang   clear moonlight with  sun rose  fairies and  eva hastened away   fountain whose cool waters  soon filled  little forms   air ringing  happy voices   elves floated   blue waves among  fair white lilies or sat   green moss smoothing their bright locks  wearing fresh garlands  dewy flowers at length  queen came forth  her subjects gathered round her  while  flowers bowed their heads   trees hushed their rustling  fairies sang their morning hymn   father  birds  blossoms who had made  earth so fair  home  them then they flew away   gardens  soon high up among  treetops or under  broad leaves sat  elves  little groups taking their breakfast  fruit  pure fresh dew while  brightwinged birds came fearlessly among them pecking  same ripe berries  dipping their little beaks   same flowercups   fairies folded their arms lovingly about them smoothed their soft bosoms  gayly sang  them “now little eva” said they “you  see  fairies  not idle wilful spirits  mortals believe come we  show you what we do” they led her   lovely room through whose walls  deep green leaves  light stole softly in here lay many wounded insects  harmless little creatures whom cruel hands had hurt  pale drooping flowers grew beside urns  healing herbs  whose fresh leaves came  faint sweet perfume eva wondered but silently followed her guide little roseleaf who  tender words passed among  delicate blossoms pouring dew  their feeble roots cheering them  her loving words  happy smile then she went   insects first   little fly who lay   flowerleaf cradle “do you suffer much dear gauzywing” asked  fairy “i  bind up your poor little leg  zephyr shall rock you  sleep” so she folded  cool leaves tenderly about  poor fly bathed his wings  brought him refreshing drink while  hummed his thanks  forgot his pain  zephyr softly sung  fanned him  her waving wings they passed on  eva saw beside each bed  fairy who  gentle hands  loving words soothed  suffering insects at length they stopped beside  bee who lay among sweet honeysuckle flowers   cool still place where  summer wind blew in   green leaves rustled pleasantly yet  seemed  find no rest  murmured   pain   doomed  bear “why must i lie here while my kindred  out   pleasant fields enjoying  sunlight   fresh air  cruel hands have doomed me  this dark place  bitter pain when i have done no wrong uncared   forgotten i must stay here among these poor things who think only  themselves come here roseleaf  bind up my wounds  i am far more useful than idle bird or fly” then said  fairy while she bathed  broken wing— “loveblossom you should not murmur we may find happiness  seeking   patient even while we suffer you  not forgotten or uncared for but others need our care more than you   those who take cheerfully  pain  sorrow sent do we most gladly give our help you need not  idle even though lying here  darkness  sorrow you can  taking  your heart all sad  discontented feelings  if love  patience blossom there you   better   lonely hours spent here look   bed beside you this little dove  suffered far greater pain than you  all our care can never ease it yet through  long days  hath lain here not  unkind word or  repining sigh hath  uttered ah loveblossom  gentle bird can teach  lesson you   wiser  better for” then  faint voice whispered “little roseleaf come quickly or i cannot thank you  i ought  all your loving care  me” so they passed   bed beside  discontented bee  here upon  softest down lay  dove whose gentle eyes looked gratefully upon  fairy  she knelt beside  little couch smoothed  soft white bosom folded her arms about   wept sorrowing tears while  bird still whispered  gratitude  love “dear fairy  fairest flowers have cheered me  their sweet breath fresh dew  fragrant leaves have been ever ready  me gentle hands  tend kindly hearts  love   this i can only thank you  say farewell” then  quivering wings  still   patient little dove  dead but  bee murmured no longer   dew   flowers fell like tears around  quiet bed sadly roseleaf led eva away saying “lilybosom shall have  grave tonight beneath our fairest blossoms  you shall see  gentleness  love  prized far above gold or beauty here  fairyland come now   flower palace  see  fairy court” beneath green arches bright  birds  flowers beside singing waves went eva into  lofty hall the roof  pure white lilies rested  pillars  green clustering vines while manycolored blossoms threw their bright shadows   walls  they danced below   deep green moss  their low sweet voices sounded softly through  sunlit palace while  rustling leaves kept time beside  throne stood eva  watched  lovely forms around her  they stood each little band   own color  glistening wings  flower wands suddenly  music grew louder  sweeter   fairies knelt  bowed their heads   through  crowd  loving subjects came  queen while  air  filled  gay voices singing  welcome her she placed  child beside her saying “little eva you shall see now how  flowers  your great earth bloom so brightly a band  loving little gardeners go daily forth  fairyland  tend  watch them  no harm may befall  gentle spirits  dwell beneath their leaves this  never known  like all good   unseen  mortal eyes  unto only pure hearts like yours do we make known our secret the humblest flower  grows  visited  our messengers  often blooms  fragrant beauty unknown unloved  all save fairy friends who seek  fill  spirits  all sweet  gentle virtues  they may not  useless   earth   noblest mortals stoop  learn  flowers now eglantine what have you  tell us  your rosy namesakes   earth” from  group  elves whose rosewreathed wands showed  flower they loved came one bearing  tiny urn and answering  queen she said— “over hill  valley they  blooming fresh  fair  summer sun  dew can make them no drooping stem or withered leaf tells  any evil thought within their fragrant bosoms  thus   fairest  their race have they gathered this sweet dew   token  their gratitude  one whose tenderness  care

throne while  murmur  approval went through  hall  each elfin wand waved   little fairy who had toiled so well  faithfully  could bring so fair  gift  their good queen then came forth  elf bearing  withered leaf while her manycolored robe   purple tulips  her hair told her name  charge “dear queen” she sadly said “i would gladly bring  pleasant tidings  my sister but alas my flowers  proud  wilful  when i went  gather my little gift  colored leaves  royal garments they bade me bring this withered blossom  tell you they would serve no longer one who  not make them queen over all  other flowers they would yield neither dew nor honey but proudly closed their leaves  bid me go” “your task  been too hard  you” said  queen kindly  she placed  drooping flower   urn eglantine had given “you  see how this dew   sweet pure heart  give new life  loveliness even  this poor faded one so can you dear rainbow  loving words  gentle teachings bring back lost purity  peace  those whom pride

air speak lovingly  them  let no unkind word or deed  theirs anger you let them see  your patient love  care how much fairer they might be  when next you come you   laden  gifts  humble loving flowers” thus they told what they had done  received  their queen some gentle chiding or loving word  praise “you   weary  this” said little roseleaf  eva “come now  see where we  taught  read  tales written  flowerleaves   sweet language   birds  all  can make  fairy heart wiser  better” then into  cheerful place they went where  many groups  flowers among whose leaves sat  child elves  learned  their flowerbooks all  fairy hands had written there some studied how  watch  tender buds when  spread them   sunlight  when  shelter them  rain how  guard  ripening seeds  when  lay them   warm earth or send them   summer wind  far off hills  valleys where other fairy hands would tend  cherish them till  sisterhood  happy flowers sprang up  beautify  gladden  lonely spot where they had fallen others learned  heal  wounded insects whose frail limbs  breeze could shatter  who   not  fairy hands would die ere half their happy summer life had gone some learned how  pleasant dreams  cheer  comfort mortal hearts  whispered words  love  save  evil deeds those who had gone astray  fill young hearts  gentle thoughts  pure affections  no sin might mar  beauty   human flower while others like mortal children learned  fairy alphabet thus  elves made loving friends  care  love  no evil thing could harm them  those they helped  cherish  protect ever watched  shield  save them eva nodded   gay little ones  they peeped  among  leaves   stranger  then she listened   fairy lessons several tiny elves stood   broad leaf while  teacher sat among  petals   flower  bent beside them  asked questions  none but fairies would care  know “twinkle if there lay nine seeds within  flowercup   wind bore five away how many would  blossom have” “four” replied  little one “rosebud if  cowslip opens three leaves  one day  four  next how many rosy leaves  there  when  whole flower  bloomed” “seven” sang  gay little elf “harebell if  silkworm spin one yard  fairy cloth   hour how many   spin   day” “twelve” said  fairy child “primrose where lies violet island” “in  lake  ripples” “lilla you may bound rose land” “on  north  ferndale south  sunny wave river east   hill  morning clouds  west   evening star” “now little ones” said  teacher “you may go  your painting  our visitor may see how we repair  flowers  earthly hands have injured” then eva saw how  large white leaves  fairies learned  imitate  lovely colors   tiny brushes  brighten  blush   anemone’s cheek  deepen  blue   violet’s eye  add new light   golden cowslip “you have stayed long enough” said  elves  length “we have many things  show you come now  see what  our dearest work” so eva said farewell   child elves  hastened  little roseleaf   gates here she saw many bands  fairies folded  dark mantles  mortals might not know them who   child among them flew away over hill  valley some went   cottages amid  hills some   seaside  watch above  humble fisher folks but little roseleaf  many others went into  noisy city eva wondered within herself what good  tiny elves could do  this great place but she soon learned   fairy band went among  poor  friendless bringing pleasant dreams   sick  old sweet tender thoughts  love  gentleness   young strength   weak  patient cheerfulness   poor  lonely then  child wondered no longer but deeper grew her love   tenderhearted elves who left their own happy home  cheer

them  go back they still led her on saying “our work  not yet done shall we leave so many sad hearts when we may cheer them so many dark homes  we may brighten we must stay yet longer little eva  you may learn yet more” then they went into  dark  lonely room  here they found  pale sadeyed child who wept bitter tears over  faded flower “ah” sighed  little one “it  my only friend  i cherished   all my lone heart’s love ’t  all  made my sad life happy    gone” tenderly  child fastened  drooping stem  placed  where  one faint ray  sunlight stole into  dreary room “do you see” said  elves “through this simple flower  we keep  child pure  stainless amid  sin  sorrow around her the love  this shall lead her  through temptation  through grief  she shall   spirit  joy  consolation   sinful   sorrowing” and  busy love toiled  elves amid  withered leaves  new strength  given   flower while  day  day  friendless child watered  growing buds deeper grew her love   unseen friends who had given

silent sorrow  heart within had grown dim  cold no sunlight could enter   darkened eyes  none  near  whisper gentle words  cheer  comfort thus  dwelt forgotten  alone seeking  give no joy  others possessing none himself life  dark  sad till  untiring elves came  his dreary home bringing sunlight  love they whispered sweet words  comfort—how if  darkened eyes could find no light without within

while  strove  tell them all  good  gentleness  love had done  him still  elves watched near  brighter grew  heart  kindly thoughts  tender feelings entered in  made  their home  when  old man fell asleep above his grave little feet trod lightly  loving hands laid fragrant flowers then went  elves into  dreary prisonhouses where sad hearts pined  lonely sorrow   joy  freedom they had lost to these came  loving band  tender words telling   peace they yet might win  patient striving  repentant tears thus waking  their bosoms all  holy feelings  sweet affections  had slept so long they told

filled  patient hope  earnest longing  win back their lost innocence  joy thus  all who needed help or comfort went  faithful fairies  when  length they turned towards fairyland many   grateful happy hearts they left behind then through  summer sky above  blossoming earth they journeyed home happier   joy they had given wiser   good they had done all fairyland  dressed  flowers   soft wind went singing by laden  their fragrant breath sweet music sounded through  air  troops  elves  their gayest robes hastened   palace where  feast  spread soon  bright hall  filled  smiling faces  fair forms  little eva  she stood beside  queen thought she had never seen  sight so lovely the manycolored shadows   fairest flowers played   pure white walls  fountains sparkled   sunlight making music   cool waves rose  fell while   fro  waving wings  joyous voices went  smiling elves bearing fruit  honey or fragrant garlands  each other’s hair long they feasted gayly they sang  eva dancing merrily among them longed    elf  she might dwell forever  so fair  home at length  music ceased   queen said  she laid her hand  little eva’s shining hair— “dear child tomorrow we must bear you home for much  we long  keep you   wrong  bring such sorrow  your loving earthly friends therefore we  guide you   brookside  there say farewell till you come again  visit us nay do not weep dear roseleaf you shall watch over little eva’s flowers  when she looks  them she  think  you come now  lead her   fairy garden  show her what we think our fairest sight weep no more but strive  make her last hours  us happy  you can” with gentle caresses  most tender words  loving elves gathered about  child and  roseleaf  her side they led her through  palace  along green winding paths till eva saw what seemed  wall  flowers rising before her while  air  filled   most fragrant odors   low sweet music   singing blossoms “where have you brought me  what mean these lovely sounds” asked eva “look here  you shall see” said roseleaf  she bent aside  vines “but listen silently or you cannot hear” then eva looking through  drooping vines beheld  garden filled   loveliest flowers fair   all  blossoms she had seen  fairyland none  so beautiful  these the rose glowed   deeper crimson  lily’s soft leaves  more purely white  crocus  humble cowslip shone like sunlight   violet  blue   sky  smiled above it “how beautiful they are” whispered eva “but dear roseleaf why do you keep them here  why call you this your fairest sight” “look again  i  tell you” answered  fairy eva looked  saw  every flower  tiny form come forth  welcome  elves who all save roseleaf had flown above  wall   now scattering dew upon  flowers’ bright leaves  talking gayly   spirits who gathered around them  seemed full  joy  they had come the child saw  each one wore  colors   flower    home delicate  graceful   little forms bright  silken hair  fell about each lovely face  eva heard  low sweet murmur  their silvery voices   rustle  their wings she gazed  silent wonder forgetting she knew not who they were till  fairy said— “these   spirits   flowers  this  fairy home where those whose hearts  pure  loving   earth come  bloom  fadeless beauty here when their earthly life  past the humblest flower  blooms   home  us  outward beauty   worthless thing if all  not fair  sweet within do you see yonder lovely spirit singing  my sister moonlight  clover blossom  her home  she dwelt unknown unloved yet patient  content bearing cheerfully  sorrows sent her we watched  saw how fair  sweet  humble flower grew  then gladly bore her here  blossom   lily   rose the flowers’ lives  often short  cruel hands destroy them therefore   our greatest joy  bring them hither where no careless foot or wintry wind can harm them where they bloom  quiet beauty repaying our care  their love  sweetest perfumes” “i  never break another flower” cried eva “but let me go  them dear fairy i would gladly know  lovely spirits  ask forgiveness   sorrow i have caused may i not go in” “nay dear eva you   mortal child  cannot enter here but i  tell them   kind little maiden who  learned  love them  they  remember you when you  gone come now  you have seen enough  we must  away” on  rosy morning cloud surrounded   loving elves went eva through  sunny sky the fresh wind bore them gently on  soon they stood again beside  brook whose waves danced brightly  if  welcome them “now ere we say farewell” said  queen  they gathered nearer   child “tell me dear eva what among all our fairy gifts  make you happiest   shall  yours” “you good little fairies” said eva folding them  her arms  she  no longer  tiny child she had been  fairyland “you dear good little elves what can i ask  you who have done so much  make me happy  taught me so many good  gentle lessons  memory  which  never pass away i can only ask  you  power    pure  gentle  yourselves  tender  loving   weak  sorrowing  untiring  kindly deeds  all grant me this gift  you shall see  little eva  not forgotten what you have taught her” “the power shall  yours” said  elves  laid their soft hands  her head “we  watch over you  dreams  when you would have tidings  us ask  flowers  your garden  they  tell you all you would know farewell remember fairyland  all your loving friends” they clung about her tenderly  little roseleaf placed  flower crown  her head whispering softly “when you would come  us again stand   brookside  wave this   air  we  gladly take you  our home again farewell dear eva think  your little roseleaf when among  flowers” long eva watched their shining wings  listened   music  their voices  they flew singing home  when  length  last little form had vanished among  clouds she saw  all around her where  elves had been  fairest flowers had sprung up   lonely brookside   blooming garden thus she stood among  waving blossoms   fairy garland  her hair  happy feelings  her heart better  wiser  her visit  fairyland “now startwinkle what have you  teach” asked  queen “nothing but  little song i heard  harebells singing” replied  fairy and taking her harp sang   low sweet voice— the flower’s lesson there grew  fragrant rosetree where  brook flows with two little tender buds  one full rose when  sun went down  his bed   west the little buds leaned   rosemother’s breast while  bright eyed stars their long watch kept and  flowers   valley  their green cradles slept then silently  odors they communed  each other the two little buds   bosom  their mother “o sister” said  little one  she gazed   sky “i wish   dew elves  they wander lightly by would bring me  star  they never grow dim and  father does not need them  burn round him the shining drops  dew  elves bring each day and place  my bosom so soon pass away but  star would glitter brightly through  long summer hours and i should  fairer than all my sister flowers that  better far than  dewdrops  fall on  high   low  come alike  all i would  fair  stately   bright star  shine and give  queenly air  this crimson robe  mine” and proudly she cried “these fireflies shall  my jewels since  stars can never come  me” just then  tiny dewdrop  hung o’er  dell on  breast   bud like  soft star fell but impatiently she flung  away  her leaf and  fell  her mother like  tear  grief while she folded  her breast  wilful pride a glittering firefly  hung  her side “heed” said  mother rose “daughter mine why shouldst thou seek  beauty not thine the father hath made thee what thou now art and what  most loveth   sweet pure heart then why dost thou take  such discontent the loving gift which   thee hath sent for  cool fresh dew  render thee far more lovely  sweet than  brightest star they  made  heaven  can never come  shine like  firefly thou hast   foolish breast  thine o my foolish little bud do listen  thy mother care only  true beauty  seek  no other there   grief  trouble   wilful little heart unfold thy leaves my daughter  let  fly depart” but  proud little bud would have her own will and folded  firefly more closely still till  struggling insect tore open  vest of purple  green  covered her breast when  sun came up she saw  grief the blooming  her sister bud leaf  leaf while she once  fair  bright   rest hung her weary head down  her wounded breast bright grew  sunshine   soft summer air was filled   music  flowers singing there but faint grew  little bud  thirst  pain and longed   cool dew but now ’t   vain then bitterly she wept  her folly  pride as drooping she stood  her fair sister’s side then  rose mother leaned  weary little head on her bosom  rest  tenderly she said “thou hast learned my little bud that whatever may betide thou canst win thyself no joy  passion or  pride the loving father sends  sunshine   shower that thou mayst become  perfect little flower— the sweet dews  feed thee  soft wind  cheer and  earth   pleasant home while thou art dwelling here then shouldst thou not  grateful  all this kindly care and strive  keep thyself most innocent  fair then seek my little blossom  win humility be fair without  pure within  thou wilt happy be so when  quiet autumn  thy fragrant life shall come thou mayst pass away  bloom   flower spirits’ home” then   mother’s breast where  still lay hid into  fading bud  dewdrop gently slid stronger grew  little form  happy tears fell as  dew did  silent work   bud grew well while  gentle rose leaned  motherly pride o’er  fair little ones  bloomed  her side night came again   fireflies flew but  bud let them pass  drank   dew while  soft stars shone   still summer heaven on  happy little flower  had learned  lesson given the musicloving elves clapped their hands  startwinkle ceased   queen placed  flower crown   gentle smile upon  fairy’s head saying— “the little bud’s lesson shall teach us how sad  thing  pride   humility alone can bring true happiness  flower  fairy you shall come next zephyr” and  little fairy who lay rocking   fro upon  fluttering vineleaf thus began her story— “as i lay resting   bosom   cowslip  bent above  brook  little wind tired  play told me this tale  lilybell and thistledown once upon  time two little fairies went out into  world  seek their fortune thistledown   gay  gallant  little elf  ever spread  wing his purple mantle  doublet  green  embroidered   brightest threads   plume  his cap came always   wing   gayest butterfly but   not loved  fairyland for like  flower whose name  colors  wore though fair  look upon many   little thorns  cruelty  selfishness  lay concealed  his gay mantle many  gentle flower  harmless bird died  his hand   cared  himself alone  whatever gave him pleasure must  his though happy hearts  rendered sad  peaceful homes destroyed such  thistledown but far different  his little friend lilybell kind compassionate  loving wherever her gentle face  seen joy  gratitude  found no suffering flower or insect  did not love  bless  kindly fairy  thus all elfland looked upon her   friend nor did this make her vain  heedless  others she humbly dwelt among them seeking  do all  good she might  many  houseless bird  hungry insect  thistledown had harmed did she feed  shelter   return no evil could befall her  so many friends  all about her seeking  repay her tenderness  love  their watchful care she would not now have left fairyland but  help  counsel her wild companion thistledown who discontented  his quiet home would seek his fortune   great world  she feared  would suffer  his own faults  others would not always   gentle  forgiving  his kindred so  kind little fairy left her home  friends  go  him  thus side  side they flew beneath  bright summer sky on  on over hill  valley they went chasing  gay butterflies or listening   bees  they flew  flower  flower like busy little housewives singing  they worked till  last they reached  pleasant garden filled  flowers  green old trees “see” cried thistledown “what  lovely home  here let us rest among  cool leaves  hear  flowers sing  i am sadly tired  hungry” so into  quiet garden they went   winds gayly welcomed them while  flowers nodded  their stems offering their bright leaves   elves  rest upon  fresh sweet honey  refresh them “now dear thistle do not harm these friendly blossoms” said lilybell “see how kindly they spread their leaves  offer us their dew it would  very wrong  you  repay their care  cruelty  pain you   tender  my sake dear thistle” then she went among  flowers  they bent lovingly before her  laid their soft leaves against her little face  she might see how glad they   welcome one so good  gentle  kindly offered their dew  honey   weary little fairy who sat among their fragrant petals  looked smilingly   happy blossoms who  their soft low voices sang her  sleep while lilybell lay dreaming among  roseleaves thistledown went wandering through  garden first  robbed  bees  their honey  rudely shook  little flowers   might get  dew they had gathered  bathe their buds in then  chased  bright winged flies  wounded them   sharp thorn  carried   sword  broke  spider’s shining webs lamed  birds  soon wherever  passed lay wounded insects  drooping flowers while  winds carried  tidings over  garden  bird  blossom looked upon him   evil spirit  fled away or closed their leaves lest  should harm them thus  went leaving sorrow  pain behind him till  came   roses where lilybell lay sleeping there weary  his cruel sport  stayed  rest beneath  graceful rosetree where grew one blooming flower   tiny bud “why  you so slow  blooming little one you  too old   rocked  your green cradle longer  should  out among your sister flowers” said thistle   lay idly   shadow   tree “my little bud  not yet strong enough  venture forth” replied  rose  she bent fondly over it “the sunlight   rain would blight her tender form  she  blossom now but soon she   fit  bear them till then she  content  rest beside her mother   wait” “you silly flower” said thistledown “see how quickly i  make you bloom your waiting  all useless” and speaking thus  pulled rudely apart  folded leaves  laid them open   sun  air while  rose mother implored  cruel fairy  leave her little bud untouched “it  my first my only one” said she “and i have watched over   such care hoping  would soon bloom beside me  now you have destroyed it how could you harm  little helpless one  never did aught  injure you” and while her tears fell like summer rain she drooped  grief above  little bud  sadly watched  fading   sunlight but thistledown heedless   sorrow  had given spread his wings  flew away soon  sky grew dark  heavy drops began  fall then thistle hastened   lily  her cup  deep   white leaves fell like curtains over  fragrant bed    dainty little elf  could not sleep among  clovers  bright buttercups but when  asked  flower  unfold her leaves  take him in she turned her pale soft face away  answered sadly “i must shield my little drooping sisters whom you have harmed  cannot let you in” then thistledown  very angry  turned  find shelter among  stately roses but they showed their sharp thorns and while their rosy faces glowed  anger told him  begone or they would repay him   wrong  had done their gentle kindred he would have stayed  harm them but  rain fell fast   hurried away saying “the tulips  take me in  i have praised their beauty  they  vain  foolish flowers” but when  came all wet  cold praying  shelter among their thick leaves they only laughed  said scornfully “we know you   not let you in  you  false  cruel   only bring us sorrow you need not come  us  another mantle when  rain  spoilt your fine one  do not stay here or we  do you harm” then they waved their broad leaves stormily  scattered  heavy drops  his dripping garments “now must i go   humble daisies  blue violets” said thistle “they   glad  let  so fine  fairy  i shall die  this cold wind  rain” so away  flew  fast  his heavy wings would bear him   daisies but they nodded their heads wisely  closed their leaves yet closer saying sharply— “go away  yourself  do not imagine we  open our leaves  you  spoil our seeds  letting   rain it serves you rightly  gain our love  confidence  repay   such cruelty you  find no shelter here  one whose careless hand wounded our little friend violet  broke  truest heart  ever beat   flower’s breast we  very angry  you wicked fairy go away  hide yourself” “ah” cried  shivering elf “where can i find shelter i  go   violets they  forgive  take me in” but  daisies had spoken truly  gentle little flower  dead  her blueeyed sisters  weeping bitterly over her faded leaves “now i have no friends” sighed poor thistledown “and must die  cold ah if i had but minded lilybell i might now  dreaming beneath some flower’s leaves” “others can forgive  love beside lilybell  violet” said  faint sweet voice “i have no little bud  shelter now  you can enter here” it   rose mother  spoke  thistle saw how pale  bright leaves had grown  how  slender stem  bowed grieved ashamed  wondering   flower’s forgiving words  laid his weary head   bosom  had filled  sorrow   fragrant leaves  folded carefully about him but  could find no rest the rose strove  comfort him but when she fancied   sleeping thoughts  her lost bud stole in   little heart beat so sadly where  lay  no sleep came while  bitter tears  had caused  flow fell more coldly  him than  rain without then  heard  other flowers whispering among themselves  his cruelty   sorrow  had brought  their happy home  many wondered how  rose who had suffered most could yet forgive  shelter him “never could i forgive one who had robbed me  my children i could bow my head  die but could give no happiness  one who had taken all my own” said hyacinth bending fondly over  little ones  blossomed  her side “dear violet  not  only one who  leave us” sobbed little mignonette “the rose mother  fade like her little bud  we shall lose our gentlest teacher her last lesson  forgiveness let us show our love  her   gentle stranger lilybell  allowing no unkind word or thought  him who  brought us all this grief” the angry words  hushed  through  long night nothing  heard but  dropping   rain   low sighs   rose soon  sunlight came again    lilybell seeking  thistledown but   ashamed  stole away when  flowers told their sorrow  kindhearted lilybell she wept bitterly   pain her friend had given   loving words strove  comfort those whom  had grieved  gentle care she healed  wounded birds  watched above  flowers  had harmed bringing each day dew  sunlight  refresh  strengthen till all  well again  though sorrowing  their dead friends still they forgave thistle   sake  her who had done so much  them thus erelong buds fairer than  she had lost lay   rose mother’s breast   all she had suffered she  well repaid   love  lilybell  her sister flowers and when bird bee  blossom  strong  fair again  gentle fairy said farewell  flew away  seek her friend leaving behind many grateful hearts who owed their joy  life  her meanwhile over hill  dale went thistledown    time  kind  gentle  every living thing he missed sadly  little friend who had left her happy home  watch over him but   too proud  own his fault  so went on hoping she would find him one day  fell asleep  when  woke  sun had set   dew began  fall  flowercups  closed   had nowhere  go till  friendly little bee belated  his heavy load  honey bid  weary fairy come  him “help me  bear my honey home  you can stay  us tonight”  kindly said so thistle gladly went  him  soon they came   pleasant garden where among  fairest flowers stood  hive covered  vines  overhung  blossoming trees glowworms stood   door  light them home   they passed in  fairy thought how charming  must   dwell  such  lovely place the floor  wax  pure  white  marble while  walls  formed  golden honeycomb   air  fragrant   breath  flowers “you cannot see our queen tonight” said  little bee “but i  show you   bed where you can rest” and  led  tired fairy   little cell where   bed  flowerleaves  folded his wings  fell asleep as  first ray  sunlight stole in   awakened  sweet music it   morning song   bees “awake awake   earliest gleam of golden sunlight shines on  rippling waves  brightly flow beneath  flowering vines awake awake   low sweet chant of  wildbirds’ morning hymn comes floating    fragrant air through  forest cool  dim then spread each wing and work  sing through  long bright sunny hours o’er  pleasant earth we journey forth for  day among  flowers “awake awake   summer wind hath bidden  blossoms unclose hath opened  violet’s soft blue eye and wakened  sleeping rose and lightly they wave  their slender stems fragrant  fresh  fair waiting  us  we singing come to gather our honeydew there then spread each wing and work  sing through  long bright sunny hours o’er  pleasant earth we journey forth for  day among  flowers” soon his friend came  bid him rise   queen desired  speak  him so  his purple mantle thrown gracefully over his shoulder  his little cap held respectfully  his hand  followed nimblewing   great hall where  queen  being served  her little pages some bore her fresh dew  honey some fanned her  fragrant flowerleaves while others scattered  sweetest perfumes   air “little fairy” said  queen “you  welcome  my palace  we  gladly have you stay  us if you  obey our laws we do not spend  pleasant summer days  idleness  pleasure but each one labors   happiness  good  all if our home  beautiful we have made  so  industry  here  one large loving family we dwell no sorrow care or discord can enter in while all obey  voice  her who seeks    wise  gentle queen  them if you  stay  us we  teach you many things order patience industry who can teach so well  they who   emblems  these virtues “our laws  few  simple you must each day gather your share  honey see  your cell  sweet  fresh  you yourself must be rise   sun   him  sleep you must harm no flower  doing your work nor take more than your just share  honey  they so kindly give us food   most cruel  treat them  aught save gentleness  gratitude now  you stay  us  learn what even mortals seek  know  labor brings true happiness” and thistle said  would stay  dwell  them    tired  wandering alone  thought  might live here till lilybell should come or till   weary   kindhearted bees then they took away his gay garments  dressed him like themselves   black velvet cloak  golden bands across his breast “now come  us” they said so forth into  green fields they went  made their breakfast among  dewy flowers  then till  sun set they flew  bud  blossom singing  they went  thistle   while  happier than when breaking flowers  harming gentle birds but  soon grew tired  working all day   sun  longed   free again he could find no pleasure   industrious bees  sighed   away  his idle friends  butterflies so while  others worked  slept or played  then  haste  get his share  tore  flowers  took all they had saved  their own food nor  this all  told such pleasant tales   life  led before  came  live  them  many grew unhappy  discontented  they who had before wished no greater joy than  love  praise  their kind queen now disobeyed  blamed her  all she had done  them long she bore  their unkind words  deeds  when  length she found    ungrateful fairy who had wrought this trouble  her quiet kingdom she strove  sweet forgiving words  show him all  wrong  had done but  would not listen  still went  destroying  happiness  those who had done so much  him then when she saw  no kindness could touch his heart she said— “thistledown we took you in  friendless stranger fed  clothed you  made our home  pleasant  you  we could   return  all our care you have brought discontent  trouble  my subjects grief  care  me i cannot let my peaceful kingdom  disturbed  you therefore go  seek another home you may find other friends but none  love you more than we had you been worthy  it so farewell” and  doors   once happy home  had disturbed  closed behind him then   very angry  determined  bring some great sorrow   good queen so  sought out  idle wilful bees whom  had first made discontented bidding them follow him  win  honey  queen had stored up   winter “let us feast  make merry   pleasant summertime” said thistle “winter  far off why should we waste these lovely days toiling  lay up  food we might enjoy now come we  take what we have made  think no more  what  queen  said” so while  industrious bees  out among  flowers  led  drones   hive  took possession   honey destroying  laying waste  home   kind bees then fearing   their grief  anger they might harm him thistle flew away  seek new friends after many wanderings  came  length   great forest  here beside  still lake  stayed  rest delicate woodflowers grew near him   deep green moss  drooping heads  if they listened   soft wind singing among  pines brighteyed birds peeped  him  their nests  manycolored insects danced above  cool still lake “this   pleasant place” said thistle “it shall  my home   while come hither blue dragonfly i would gladly make  friend  you  i am all alone” the dragonfly folded his shining wings beside  elf listened   tale  told promised  befriend  lonely one  strove  make  forest  happy home  him so here dwelt thistle  many kind friends gathered round him   spoke gently  them  they knew nothing   cruel deeds  had done    while   happy  content but  length  grew weary   gentle birds  wildflowers  sought new pleasure  destroying  beauty   tired of  soon  friends who had so kindly welcomed him looked upon him   evil spirit  shrunk away   approached at length his friend  dragonfly besought him  leave  quiet home  had disturbed then thistle  very angry  while  dragonfly  sleeping among  flowers  hung over  lake  led  ugly spider   spot  bade him weave his nets about  sleeping insect  bind him fast the cruel spider gladly obeyed  ungrateful fairy  soon  poor fly could move neither leg nor wing then thistle flew away through  wood leaving sorrow  trouble behind him he had not journeyed far before  grew weary  lay down  rest long  slept  when  awoke  tried  rise his hands  wings  bound while beside him stood two strange little figures  dark faces  garments  rustled like withered leaves who cried  him   struggled  get free— “lie still you naughty fairy you    brownies’ power  shall  well punished  your cruelty ere we let you go” so poor thistle lay sorrowfully wondering what would come  it  wishing lilybell would come  help  comfort him but  had left her  she could not help him now soon  troop  brownies came rustling through  air  gathered round him while one who wore  acorncup  his head   their king said   stood beside  trembling fairy— “you have done many cruel things  caused much sorrow  happy hearts now you   my power  i shall keep you prisoner till you have repented you cannot dwell   earth without harming  fair things given you  enjoy so you shall live alone  solitude  darkness till you have learned  find happiness  gentle deeds  forget yourself  giving joy  others when you have learned this i  set you free” then  brownies bore him   high dark rock and entering  little door led him   small cell dimly lighted   crevice through which came  single gleam  sunlight  there through long long days poor thistle sat alone  gazed  wistful eyes   little opening longing   out   green earth no one came  him but  silent brownies who brought his daily food   bitter tears  wept  lilybell mourning his cruelty  selfishness seeking  do some kindly deed  might atone  his wrongdoing a little vine  grew outside his prison rock came creeping up  looked  through  crevice  if  cheer  lonely fairy who welcomed  most gladly  daily sprinkled  soft leaves  his small share  water   little vine might live even if  darkened more  more his dim cell the watchful brownies saw this kind deed  brought him fresh flowers  many things which thistle gratefully received though  never knew   his kindness   vine  gained  him these pleasures thus did poor thistle strive   more gentle  unselfish  grew daily happier  better now while thistledown   captive   lonely cell lilybell  seeking him far  wide  sadly traced him   sorrowing hearts  had left behind she healed  drooping flowers cheered  queen bee’s grief brought back her discontented subjects restored  home  peace  order  left them blessing her thus she journeyed on till she reached  forest where thistledown had lost his freedom she unbound  starving dragonfly  tended  wounded birds but though all learned  love her none could tell where  brownies had borne her friend till  little wind came whispering by  told her   sweet voice had been heard singing fairy songs deep   mossgrown rock then lilybell went seeking through  forest listening   voice long she looked  listened  vain when one day  she  wandering through  lonely dell she heard  faint low sound  music  soon  distant voice mournfully singing— “bright shines  summer sun soft   summer air gayly  woodbirds sing flowers  blooming fair “but deep   dark cold rock sadly i dwell longing  thee dear friend lilybell lilybell” “thistle dear thistle where  you” joyfully cried lilybell  she flew  rock  rock but  voice  still  she would have looked  vain had she not seen  little vine whose green leaves fluttering   fro seemed beckoning her  come   she stood among  flowers she sang— “through sunlight  summer air i have sought  thee long guided  birds  flowers and now  thy song “thistledown thistledown o’er hill  dell hither  comfort thee comes lilybell” then   vineleaves two little arms  stretched out  her  thistledown  found so lilybell made her home   shadow   vine  brought such joy  thistle  his lonely cell seemed pleasanter  him than all  world beside   grew daily more like his gentle friend but  did not last long  one day she did not come he watched  waited long   little face  used  peep smiling  through  vineleaves he called  beckoned through  narrow opening but no lilybell answered   wept sadly   thought  all she had done  him   now  could not go  seek  help her   had lost his freedom  his own cruel  wicked deeds at last  besought  silent brownie earnestly  tell him whither she had gone “o let me go  her” prayed thistle “if she   sorrow i  comfort her  show my gratitude  all she  done  me dear brownie set me free  when she  found i  come   your prisoner again i  bear  suffer any danger  her sake” “lilybell  safe” replied  brownie “come you shall learn  trial  awaits you” then  led  wondering fairy  his prison   group  tall drooping ferns beneath whose shade  large white lily had been placed forming  little tent within which   couch  thick green moss lay lilybell   deep sleep  sunlight stole softly in  all  cool  still “you cannot wake her” said  brownie  thistle folded his arms tenderly about her “it   magic slumber  she  not wake till you shall bring hither gifts   earth air  water spirits ’t   long  weary task  you have made no friends  help you   have  seek  them alone this   trial we shall give you  if your love  lilybell  strong enough  keep you  all cruelty  selfishness  make you kind  loving  you should be she  awake  welcome you  love you still more fondly than before” then thistle   last look   little friend  loved so well set forth alone  his long task the home   earth spirits   first  find  no one would tell him where  look so far  wide  wandered through gloomy forests  among lonely hills  none  cheer him when sad  weary none  guide him  his way on  went thinking  lilybell   her sake bearing all   his quiet prison many gentle feelings  kindly thoughts had sprung up  his heart   now strove   friends  all  win  himself  love  confidence  those whom once  sought  harm  cruelly destroy but few believed him  they remembered his false promises  evil deeds  would not trust him now so poor thistle found few  love or care  him long  wandered  carefully  sought but could not find  earth spirits’ home and when  length  reached  pleasant garden where   lilybell first parted  said within himself— “here i  stay awhile  try  win  kindly deeds  flowers’ forgiveness   pain  sorrow i brought them long ago  they may learn  love  trust me so even if i never find  spirits i shall  worthier  lilybell’s affection if i strive  atone   wrong i have done” then  went among  flowers but they closed their leaves  shrank away trembling  fear while  birds fled  hide among  leaves   passed this grieved poor thistle   longed  tell them how changed  had become but they would not listen so  tried  show  quiet deeds  kindness   meant no harm  them  soon  kindhearted birds pitied  lonely fairy  when  came near sang cheering songs  dropped ripe berries  his path   no longer broke their eggs or hurt their little ones and when  flowers saw this  found  once cruel elf now watering  tending little buds feeding hungry insects  helping  busy ants  bear their heavy loads they shared  pity   birds  longed  trust him but they dared not yet he came one day while wandering through  garden   little rose  had once harmed so sadly many buds now bloomed beside her  her soft face glowed  motherly pride  she bent fondly over them but when thistle came  saw  sorrow how she bade them close their green curtains  conceal themselves beneath  leaves  there  danger near and drooping still more closely over them she seemed  wait  trembling fear  cruel fairy’s coming but no rude hand tore her little ones away no unkind words  spoken but  soft shower  dew fell lightly  them  thistle bending tenderly above them said— “dear flower forgive  sorrow i once brought you  trust me now  lilybell’s sake her gentleness  changed my cruelty  kindness  i would gladly repay all   harm i have done but none  love  trust me now” then  little rose looked up  while  dewdrops shone like happy tears upon her leaves she said— “i will love  trust you thistle  you  indeed much changed make your home among us  my sister flowers  soon learn  love you  you deserve not  sweet lilybell’s sake but  your own  i become your friend  you  kind  gentle now  worthy  our love look up my little ones there  no danger near look up  welcome thistle  our home” then  little buds raised their rosy faces danced again upon their stems  nodded kindly  thistle who smiled  them through happy tears  kissed  sweet forgiving rose who loved  trusted him when most forlorn  friendless but  other flowers wondered among themselves  hyacinth said— “if roseleaf  his friend surely we may be yet still i fear  may soon grow weary  this gentleness   again  wicked fairy  once was  we shall suffer  our kindness  him now” “ah do not doubt him” cried warmhearted little mignonette “surely some good spirit  changed  wicked thistle into this good little elf see how tenderly  lifts aside  leaves  overshadow pale harebell  listen now how softly  sings   rocks little eglantine  sleep he  done many friendly things though none save roseleaf  been kind  him    very sad last night when i awoke  draw my curtains closer  sat weeping   moonlight so bitterly i longed  speak  kindly word  him dear sisters let us trust him” and they all said little mignonette  right and spreading wide their leaves they bade him come  drink their dew  lie among  fragrant petals striving  cheer his sorrow thistle told them all and after much whispering together they said— “yes we  help you  find  earth spirits  you  striving   good   love  lilybell we  do much  you” so they called  little brighteyed mole  said “downyback we have given you  pleasant home among our roots  you   grateful little friend so  you guide dear thistle   earth spirits’ home” downyback said “yes”  thistle thanking  kindly flowers followed his little guide through long dark galleries deeper  deeper into  ground while  glowworm flew before  light  way on they went  after  while reached  path lit up  bright jewels hung upon  walls here downyback  glimmer  glowworm left him saying— “we can lead you no farther you must now go  alone   music   spirits  guide you  their home” then they went quickly up  winding path  thistle guided   sweet music went  alone he soon reached  lovely spot whose golden halls  bright  jewels which sparkled brightly  threw manycolored shadows   shining garments   little spirits who danced below   melody  soft silvery bells long thistle stood watching  brilliant forms  flashed  sparkled round him but  missed  flowers   sunlight  rejoiced    not  earth spirit at last they spied him out and gladly welcoming him bade him join  their dance but thistledown  too sad  that  when  told them all his story they no longer urged but sought  comfort him  one whom they called little sparkle for her crown  robe shone   brightest diamonds said “you  have  work  us ere you can win  gift  show  brownies do you see those golden bells  make such music  we wave them   fro we worked long  hard ere they  won  you can win one  those if you  do  task we give you” and thistle said “no task   too hard  me  do  dear lilybell’s sake” then they led him   strange dark place lit up  torches where troops  spirits flew busily   fro among damp rocks  through dark galleries  led far down into  earth “what do they here” asked thistle “i  tell” replied little sparkle “for i once worked here myself some  them watch above  flowerroots  keep them fresh  strong others gather  clear drops  trickle   damp rocks  form  little spring which growing ever larger rises   light above  gushes forth  some green field or lonely forest where  wildbirds come  drink  woodflowers spread their thirsty leaves above  clear cool waves  they go dancing away carrying joy  freshness wherever they go others shape  bright jewels into lovely forms  make  goodluck pennies which we give  mortals whom we love and here you must toil till  golden flower  won” then thistle went among  spirits  joined  their tasks  tended  flowerroots gathered  waterdrops  formed  goodluck pennies long  hard  worked   often sad  weary often tempted  unkind  selfish thoughts but  thought  lilybell  strove   kind  loving  she had been  soon  spirits learned  love  patient fairy who had left his home  toil among them   sake  his gentle friend at length came little sparkle  him saying “you have done enough come now  dance  feast  us   golden flower  won” but thistle could not stay  half his task  not yet done   longed  sunlight  lilybell so taking  kind farewell  hastened through  torchlit path up   light again and spreading his wings flew over hill  dale till  reached  forest where lilybell lay sleeping it  early morning   rosy light shone brightly through  lilyleaves upon her  thistle entered  laid his first gift   brownie king’s feet “you have done well” said he “we hear good tidings  you  bird  flower  you  truly seeking  repair  evil you have done take now one look  your little friend  then go forth  seek   air spirits your second gift” then thistle said farewell again  lilybell  flew far  wide among  clouds seeking  air spirits but though  wandered till his weary wings could bear him no longer    vain so faint  sad  lay down  rest   broad vineleaf  fluttered gently   wind    lay  saw beneath him  home   kind bees whom  had so disturbed  lilybell had helped  comforted “i  seek  win their pardon  show them  i am no longer  cruel fairy who so harmed them” thought thistle “and when they become again my friends i  ask their help  find  air spirits  if i deserve it they  gladly aid me  my way” so  flew down into  field below  hastened busily  flower  flower till  had filled  tiny bluebell  sweet fresh honey then  stole softly   hive and placing  near  door concealed himself  watch soon his friend nimblewing came flying home  when  spied  little cup  hummed  joy  called his companions around him “surely some good elf  placed  here  us” said they “let us bear   our queen   so fresh  fragrant     fit gift  her”  they joyfully took  in little dreaming who had placed  there so each day thistle filled  flowercup  laid    door  each day  bees wondered more  more  many strange things happened the fieldflowers told   good spirit who watched above them   birds sang   same kind little elf bringing soft moss  their nests  food  their hungry young ones while all around  hive had grown fairer since  fairy came but  bees never saw him   feared  had not yet done enough  win their forgiveness  friendship so  lived alone among  vines daily bringing them honey  doing some kindly action at length   lay sleeping   flowerbell  little bee came wandering by  knew him   wicked thistle so  called his friends and  they flew murmuring around him  awoke “what shall we do  you naughty elf” said they “you   our power  we  sting you if you  not still” “let us close  flowerleaves around him  leave him here  starve” cried one who had not yet forgotten all  sorrow thistle had caused them long ago “no no   very cruel dear buzz” said little hum “let us take him  our queen  she  tell us how  show our anger   wicked deeds  did see how bitterly  weeps  kind  him   not harm us more” “you good little hum” cried  kindhearted robin who had hopped near  listen   bees “dear friends do you not know  this   good fairy who  dwelt so quietly among us watching over bird  blossom giving joy  all  helps it  he who brings  honeycup each day  you  then goes silently away  you may never know who works so faithfully  you be kind  him  if   done wrong   repented  it  you may see” “can this  naughty thistle” said nimblewing “yes   i” said thistle “but no longer cruel  unkind i have tried  win your love  patient industry ah trust me now  you shall see i am not naughty thistle any more” then  wondering bees led him  their queen  when  had told his tale  begged their forgiveness   gladly given  all strove  show him    loved  trusted then  asked if they could tell him where  air spirits dwelt   must not forget dear lilybell   his great joy  queen said “yes”  bade little hum guide thistle  cloudland little hum joyfully obeyed  thistle followed him   flew higher  higher among  soft clouds till   distance they saw  radiant light “there  their home  i must leave you now dear thistle” said  little bee and bidding him farewell  flew singing back while thistle following  light soon found himself   air spirits’ home the sky  gold  purple like  autumn sunset  long walls  brilliant clouds lay round him a rosy light shone through  silver mist  gleaming columns   rainbow roof soft fragrant winds went whispering by  airy little forms  flitting   fro long thistle wondered   beauty round him  then  went among  shining spirits told his tale  asked  gift but they answered like  earth spirits “you must serve us first  then we  gladly give you  robe  sunlight like our own” and then they told him how they wafted flowerseeds over  earth  beautify  brighten lonely spots how they watched above  blossoms  day  scattered dews  night brought sunlight into darkened places  soft winds  refresh  cheer “these   things we do” said they “and you must aid us   time” and thistle gladly went   lovely spirits  day  joined  sunlight   breeze  their silent work  night  starlight  her sister spirits  flew over  moonlit earth dropping cool dew upon  folded flowers  bringing happy dreams  sleeping mortals many  kind deed  done many  gentle word  spoken  each day lighter grew his heart  stronger his power  giving joy  others at length starlight bade him work no more  gladly gave him  gift  had won then his second task  done   flew gayly back   green earth  slumbering lilybell the silvery moonlight shone upon her   came  give his second gift   brownie spoke more kindly than before “one more trial thistle  she  awake go bravely forth  win your last  hardest gift” then   light heart thistle journeyed away   brooks  rivers seeking  water spirits but  looked  vain till wandering through  forest where  brownies took him captive  stopped beside  quiet lake as  stood here  heard  sound  pain and looking   tall grass  his side  saw  dragonfly whose kindness  once repayed  pain  sorrow  who now lay suffering  alone thistle bent tenderly beside him saying “dear flutter do not fear me i  gladly ease your pain if you  let me i am your friend  long  show you how i grieve  all  wrong i did you when you  so kind  me forgive  let me help  comfort you” then  bound up  broken wing  spoke so tenderly  flutter doubted him no longer   his friend again day  day did thistle watch beside him making little beds  cool fresh moss  him  rest upon fanning him when  slept  singing sweet songs  cheer him when awake and often when poor flutter longed   dancing once again over  blue waves  fairy bore him  his arms   lake    broad leaf   green flag   sail they floated   still water while  dragonfly’s companions flew about them playing merry games at length  broken wing  well  thistle said  must again seek  water spirits “i can tell you where  find them” said flutter “you must follow yonder little brook    lead you   sea where  spirits dwell i would gladly do more  you dear thistle but i cannot  they live deep beneath  waves you  find some kind friend  aid you  your way  so farewell” thistle followed  little brook   flowed through field  valley growing ever larger till  reached  sea here  wind blew freshly   great waves rolled  broke  thistle’s feet   stood upon  shore watching  billows dancing  sparkling   sun “how shall i find  spirits  this great sea  none  help or guide me yet   my last task   lilybell’s sake i must not fear or falter now” said thistle so  flew hither  thither over  sea looking through  waves soon  saw far below  branches   coral tree “they must  here” thought he and folding his wings  plunged into  deep cold sea but  saw only fearful monsters  dark shapes  gathered round him and trembling  fear  struggled up again the great waves tossed him   fro  cast him bruised  faint upon  shore here  lay weeping bitterly till  voice beside him said “poor little elf what  befallen you these rough waves  not fit playmates  so delicate  thing  you tell me your sorrow  i  comfort you” and thistle looking up saw  white seabird  his side who tried  friendly words  cheer him so  told all his wanderings  how  sought  sea spirits “surely if bee  blossom do their part  help you birds should aid you too” said  seabird “i  call my friend  nautilus    bear you safely   coral palace where  spirits dwell” so spreading his great wings  flew away  soon thistle saw  little boat come dancing over  waves  wait beside  shore  him in  sprang nautilus raised his little sail   wind   light boat glided swiftly over  blue sea at last thistle cried “i see lovely arches far below let me go    spirits’ home” “nay close your eyes  trust  me i  bear you safely down” said nautilus so thistle closed his eyes  listened   murmur   sea  they sank slowly through  waves the soft sound lulled him  sleep  when  awoke  boat  gone   stood among  water spirits  their strange  lovely home lofty arches  snowwhite coral bent above him   walls  brightly tinted shells  wreathed  lovely seaflowers   sunlight shining   waves cast silvery shadows   ground where sparkling stones glowed   sand a cool fresh wind swept through  waving garlands  bright seamoss   distant murmur  dashing waves came softly   air soon troops  graceful spirits flitted by  when they found  wondering elf they gathered round him bringing pearlshells heaped  precious stones  all  rare strange gifts  lie beneath  sea but thistle wished  none  these  when his tale  told  kindly spirits pitied him  little pearl sighed  she told him   long  weary task  must perform ere  could win  crown  snowwhite pearls like those they wore but thistle had gained strength  courage  his wanderings  did not falter now when they led him   place among  coralworkers  told him  must labor here till  spreading branches reached  light  air through  waves  danced above with  patient hope   might yet  worthy  lilybell  fairy left  lovely spirits  their pleasant home  toil among  coralbuilders where all  strange  dim long long  worked but still  waves rolled far above them  his task  not yet done  many bitter tears poor thistle shed  sadly  pined  air  sunlight  voice  birds  breath  flowers often folded   magic garments which  spirits gave him   might pass unharmed among  fearful creatures dwelling there  rose   surface   sea and gliding through  waves gazed longingly upon  hills now looking blue  dim so far away or watched  flocks  summer birds journeying   warmer land  they brought sad memories  green old forests  sunny fields   lonely little fairy floating   great wild sea day after day went by  slowly thistle’s task drew towards  end busily toiled  coralworkers but more busily toiled he insect  spirit daily wondered more  more   industry  patience   silent little elf who had  friendly word  all though  never joined them  their sport higher  higher grew  coralboughs  lighter grew  fairy’s heart while thoughts  dear lilybell cheered him on  day  day  steadily toiled  when  length  sun shone  his work    done  stayed but  take  garland  had won   thank  good spirits  their love  care then up through  cold blue waves  swiftly glided and shaking  bright drops  his wings soared singing up   sunny sky on through  fragrant air went thistle looking  glad face upon  fair fresh earth below where flowers looked smiling up  green trees bowed their graceful heads  if  welcome him soon  forest where lilybell lay sleeping rose before him    passed along  cool dim woodpaths never had they seemed so fair but when  came where his little friend had slept   no longer  dark silent spot where  last saw her garlands hung  every tree   fairest flowers filled  air  their sweet breath bird’s gay voices echoed far  wide   little brook went singing by beneath  arching ferns  bent above it green leaves rustled   summer wind   air  full  music but  fairest sight  lilybell  she lay   couch  velvet moss  fairy hands had spread the golden flower lay beside her   glittering robe  folded round her little form the warmest sunlight fell upon her   softest breezes lifted her shining hair happy tears fell fast  thistle folded his arms around her crying “o lilybell dear lilybell awake i have been true  you  now my task  done” then   smile lilybell awoke  looked  wondering eyes upon  beauty  had risen round her “dear thistle what mean these fair things  why  we  this lovely place” “listen lilybell” said  brownie king   appeared beside her and then  told all  thistle had done  show his love  her how  had wandered far  wide  seek  fairy gifts  toiled long  hard  win them how  had been loving true  tender when most lonely  forsaken “bird bee  blossom have forgiven him  none  more loved  trusted now  all than  once cruel thistle” said  king   bent down   happy elf who bowed low before him “you have learned  beauty   gentle kindly heart dear thistle  you  now worthy  become  friend  her  whom you have done so much place  crown upon her head  she  queen  all  forest fairies now” and   crown shone   head  lilybell bent down  thistle’s breast  forest seemed alive  little forms who sprang  flower  leaf  gathered round her bringing gifts  their new queen “if i am queen then you  king dear thistle” said  fairy “take  crown  i  have  wreath  flowers you have toiled  suffered  my sake  you alone should rule over these little elves whose love you have won” “keep your crown lilybell  yonder come  spirits  their gifts  thistle” said  brownie and   pointed  his wand out  among  mossy roots   old tree came trooping  earth spirits their flowerbells ringing softly  they came  their jewelled garments glittering   sun on  where thistledown stood beneath  shadow   flowers  lilybell beside him went  spirits  then forth sprang little sparkle waving  golden flower whose silvery music filled  air “dear thistle” said  shining spirit “what you toiled so faithfully  win  another let us offer now   token  our love  you” as she ceased down through  air came floating bands  lovely air spirits bringing  shining robe  they too told their love   gentle fairy who had dwelt  them then softly   breeze came distant music growing ever nearer till over  rippling waves came  singing water spirits  their boats  manycolored shells   they placed their glittering crown  thistle’s head loud rang  flowers  joyously sang  birds while all  forest fairies cried  silvery voices “lilybell  thistledown long live our king  queen” “have you  tale  us too dear violeteye” said  queen  zephyr ceased the little elf thus named looked  among  flowerleaves where she sat    smile replied “as i  weaving garlands   field i heard  primrose tell this tale  her friend goldenrod” little bud in  great forest high up among  green boughs lived bird brownbreast  his brighteyed little mate they  now very happy their home  done  four blue eggs lay   soft nest   little wife sat still  patient  them while  husband sang  told her charming tales  brought her sweet berries  little worms things went smoothly on till one day she found   nest  little white egg   golden band about it “my friend” cried she “come  see where can this fine egg have come from my four  here  this also what think you  it” the husband shook his head gravely  said “be not alarmed my love   doubtless some good fairy who  given us this  we shall find some gift within do not let us touch it but do you sit carefully upon it  we shall see  time what  been sent us” so they said nothing about it  soon their home had four little chirping children  then  white egg opened and behold  little maiden lay singing within then how amazed  they  how they welcomed her  she lay warm beneath  mother’s wing  how  young birds did love her great joy    forest  proud   parents  their family  still more   little one who had come  them while all  neighbors flocked in  see dame brownbreast’s little child and  tiny maiden talked  them  sang so merrily  they could have listened  ever soon she   joy   whole forest dancing  tree  tree making every nest her home  none  ever so welcome  little bud  so they lived right merrily   green old forest the father now had much  do  supply his family  food  choice morsels did  bring little bud the wild fruits  her food  fresh dew   flowercups her drink while  green leaves served her  little robes  thus she found garments   flowers   field   happy home  mother brownbreast  all   wood   stately trees   little mosses   turf  friends   merry child and each day she taught  young birds sweet songs   their gay music rang through  old forest  stern dark pines ceased their solemn waving  they might hear  soft sounds stealing through  dim woodpaths  mortal children came  listen saying softly “hear  flowers sing  touch them not   fairies  here” then came  band  sad little elves  bud praying  they might hear  sweet music  when she took them   hand  spoke gently  them they wept  said sadly when she asked them whence they came— “we dwelt once  fairyland  o how happy  we then but alas we  not worthy  so fair  home   sent forth into  cold world look  our robes they  like  withered leaves our wings  dim our crowns  gone  we lead sad lonely lives  this dark forest let us stay  you your gay music sounds like fairy songs  you have such  friendly way  you  speak so gently  us it  good   near one so lovely  so kind  you can tell us how we may again become fair  innocent say we may stay  you kind little maiden” and bud said “yes”  they stayed but her kind little heart  grieved  they wept so sadly  all she could say could not make them happy till  last she said— “do not weep  i  go  queen dewdrop  beseech her  let you come back i  tell her  you  repentant   do anything  gain her love again  you  sad  long   forgiven this  i say  more  trust she  grant my prayer” “she  not say no  you dear bud” said  poor little fairies “she  love you  we do  if we can but come again  our lost home we cannot give you thanks enough go bud  if there  power  fairy gifts you shall   happy  our hearts’ best love can make you” the tidings  bud’s departure flew through  forest  all her friends came  say farewell    morning sun she would go  each brought some little gift   land  fairies  far away  she must journey long “nay you shall not go  your feet my child” said mother brownbreast “your friend goldenwing shall carry you call him hither  i may seat you rightly  if you should fall off my heart would break” then up came goldenwing  bud  safely seated   cushion  violetleaves    really charming  see her merry little face peeping  under  broad brim  her cowslip hat  her butterfly steed stood waving his bright wings   sunlight then came  bee  his yellow honeybags which  begged she would take   little brown spider  lived under  great leaves brought  veil  her hat  besought her  wear it lest  sun should shine too brightly while  ant came bringing  tiny strawberry lest she should miss her favorite fruit the mother gave her good advice   papa stood  his head  one side  his round eyes twinkling  delight  think  his little bud  going  fairyland then they all sang gayly together till she passed out  sight over  hills  they saw her no more and now bud left  old forest far behind her goldenwing bore her swiftly along  she looked down   green mountains   peasant’s cottages  stood among overshadowing trees   earth looked bright   broad blue rivers winding through soft meadows  singing birds  flowers who kept their bright eyes ever   sky and she sang gayly  they floated   clear air while her friend kept time  his waving wings  ever  they went along all grew fairer  thus they came  fairyland as bud passed through  gates she no longer wondered   exiled fairies wept  sorrowed   lovely home they had lost bright clouds floated   sunny sky casting  rainbow light   fairy palaces below where  elves  dancing while  low sweet voices   singing flowers sounded softly through  fragrant air  mingled   music   rippling waves  they flowed  beneath  blossoming vines  drooped above them all  bright  beautiful but kind little bud would not linger   forms   weeping fairies  before her  though  blossoms nodded gayly  their stems  welcome her   soft winds kissed her cheek she would not stay but    flower palace she went into  pleasant hall whose walls  formed  crimson roses amid whose leaves sat little elves making sweet music  their harps when they saw bud they gathered round her  led her through  flowerwreathed arches   group   most beautiful fairies who  gathered about  stately lily  whose fragrant cup sat one whose purple robe  glittering crown told she  their queen bud knelt before her and while tears streamed down her little face she told her errand  pleaded earnestly   exiled fairies might  forgiven  not  left  pine far  their friends  kindred and  she prayed many wept  her  when she ceased  waited  her answer many knelt beside her praying forgiveness   unhappy elves with tearful eyes queen dewdrop replied— “little maiden your prayer  softened my heart they shall not  left sorrowing  alone nor shall you go back without  kindly word  cheer  comfort them we  pardon their fault  when they can bring hither  perfect fairy crown robe  wand they shall  again received  children  their loving queen the task  hard  none but  best  purest can form  fairy garments yet  patience they may yet restore their robes  their former brightness farewell good little maiden come  them  but  you they would have dwelt  ever without  walls  fairyland” “good speed  you  farewell” cried they all as  loving messages  their poor friends they bore her   gates day after day toiled little bud cheering  fairies who angry  disappointed would not listen  her gentle words but turned away  sat alone weeping they grieved her kind heart  many cruel words but patiently she bore  them  when they told her they could never perform so hard  task  must dwell  ever   dark forest she answered gently   snowwhite lily must  planted  watered  repentant tears before  robe  innocence could  won   sun  love must shine  their hearts before  light could return  their dim crowns  deeds  kindness must  performed ere  power would come again  their now useless wands then they planted  lilies but they soon drooped  died  no light came  their crowns they did no gentle deeds but cared only  themselves  when they found their labor   vain they tried no longer but sat weeping bud  ceaseless toil  patient care tended  lilies which bloomed brightly  crowns grew bright   her hands  wands had power over birds  blossoms  she  striving  give happiness  others forgetful  herself and  idle fairies  thankful words took  garments  her  then  bud went forth  fairyland  stood  beating hearts before  gates where crowds  fairy friends came forth  welcome them but when queen dewdrop touched them  her wand  they passed in  light faded  their crowns their robes became like withered leaves  their wands  powerless amid  tears  all  fairies  queen led them   gates  said— “farewell it  not  my power  aid you innocence  love  not within your hearts    not  this untiring little maiden who  toiled while you have wept you never would have entered your lost home go  strive again  till all  once more fair  pure i cannot call you mine” “farewell” sang  weeping fairies   gates closed  their outcast friends who humbled  brokenhearted gathered around bud  she  cheering words guided them back   forest time passed on   fairies had done nothing  gain their lovely home again they wept no longer but watched little bud  she daily tended  flowers restoring their strength  beauty or  gentle words flew  nest  nest teaching  little birds  live happily together  wherever she went blessings fell  loving hearts  filled  gratitude then one  one  elves secretly did some little work  kindness  found  quiet joy come back  repay them flowers looked lovingly up  they passed birds sang  cheer them when sad thoughts made them weep and soon little bud found out their gentle deeds  her friendly words gave them new strength so day after day they followed her  like  band  guardian spirits they flew far  wide carrying  them joy  peace and not only birds  flowers blessed them but human beings also   tender hands they guided little children  danger  kept their young hearts free  evil thoughts they whispered soothing words   sick  brought sweet odors  fair flowers  their lonely rooms they sent lovely visions   old  blind  make their hearts young  bright  happy thoughts but most tenderly did they watch over  poor  sorrowing  many  poor mother blessed  unseen hands  laid food before her hungry little ones  folded warm garments round their naked limbs many  poor man wondered   fair flowers  sprang up  his little gardenplot cheering him  their bright forms  making his dreary home fair  their loveliness  looked  his once barren field where now waved  golden corn turning  broad leaves   warm sun  promising  store  golden ears  give him food while  careworn face grew bright   troubled heart filled  gratitude towards  invisible spirits who had brought him such joy thus time passed on  though  exiled fairies longed often  their home still knowing they did not deserve it they toiled on hoping one day  see  friends they had lost while  joy  their own hearts made their life full  happiness one day came little bud  them saying— “listen dear friends i have  hard task  offer you it   great sacrifice  you light loving fairies  dwell through  long winter   dark cold earth watching over  flower roots  keep them free   little grubs  worms  seek  harm them but   sunny spring when they bloom again their love  gratitude  give you happy homes among their bright leaves “it   wearisome task  i can give you no reward  all your tender care but  blessings   gentle flowers you  have saved  death gladly would i aid you but my winged friends  preparing  their journey  warmer lands  i must help them teach their little ones  fly  see them safely  their way then through  winter must i seek  dwellings   poor  suffering comfort  sick  lonely  give hope  courage  those who  their poverty  led astray these things must i do but when  flowers bloom again i    you  welcome back our friends  over  sea” then  tears  fairies answered “ah good little bud you have taken  hardest task yourself  who  repay you  all your deeds  tenderness  mercy   great world should evil befall you our hearts would break we  labor trustingly   earth  thoughts  you shall cheer us on  without you we had been worthless beings  never known  joy  kindly actions bring yes dear bud we  gladly toil among  roots   fair flowers may wear their gayest robes  welcome you” then deep   earth  fairies dwelt  no frost or snow could harm  blossoms they tended every little seed  laid   soft earth watered  watched tender roots  folded  withered leaves  no chilling drops might reach them  safely dreamed  flowers till summer winds should call them forth while lighter grew each fairy heart  every gentle deed  tenderly performed at length  snow  gone  they heard little voices calling them  come up but patiently they worked till seed  root  green  strong then  eager feet they hastened   earth above where over hill  valley bright flowers  budding trees smiled   warm sunlight blossoms bent lovingly before them  rang their colored bells till  fragrant air  full  music while  stately trees waved their great arms above them  scattered soft leaves  their feet then came  merry birds making  wood alive  their gay voices calling  one another  they flew among  vines building their little homes long waited  elves   last she came  father brownbreast happy days passed  summer flowers   their fullest beauty when bud bade  fairies come  her mounted  brightwinged butterflies they flew over forest  meadow till  joyful eyes they saw  flowercrowned walls  fairyland before  gates they stood  soon troops  loving elves came forth  meet them and  through  sunny gardens they went into  lily hall where among  golden stamens   graceful flower sat  queen while   broad green leaves around  stood  brighteyed little maids  honor then amid  deep silence little bud leading  fairies   throne said— “dear queen i here bring back your subjects wiser  their sorrow better  their hard trial  now might any queen  proud  them  bow  learn  them  giving joy  peace  others brings  fourfold  us bearing  double happiness   blessings  those we help through  dreary months when they might have dwelt among fair southern flowers beneath  smiling sky they toiled   dark  silent earth filling  hearts   gentle flower spirits  grateful love seeking no reward but  knowledge  their own good deeds   joy they always bring this they have done unmurmuringly  alone  now far  wide flower blessings fall upon them   summer winds bear  glad tidings unto those who droop  sorrow  new joy  strength  brings  they look longingly   friends whose gentle care hath brought such happiness  their fair kindred “are they not worthy  your love dear queen have they not won their lovely home say they  pardoned  you have gained  love  hearts pure   snowwhite robes now folded over them” as bud ceased she touched  wondering fairies  her wand   dark faded garments fell away  beneath  robes  lilyleaves glittered pure  spotless   sunlight then while happy tears fell queen dewdrop placed  bright crowns   bowed heads   kneeling fairies  laid before them  wands their own good deeds had rendered powerful they turned  thank little bud  all her patient love but she  gone  high above   clear air they saw  little form journeying back   quiet forest she needed no reward but  joy she had given the fairy hearts  pure again  her work  done yet all fairyland had learned  lesson  gentle little bud “now little sunbeam what have you  tell us” said  queen looking down   brighteyed elf who sat half hidden   deep moss  her feet “i too like startwinkle have nothing but  song  offer” replied  fairy  then while  nightingale’s sweet voice mingled  her own she sang— cloverblossom in  quiet pleasant meadow beneath  summer sky where green old trees their branches waved and winds went singing by where  little brook went rippling so musically low and passing clouds cast shadows on  waving grass below where low sweet notes  brooding birds stole out   fragrant air and golden sunlight shone undimmed on all most fresh  fair— there bloomed  lovely sisterhood of happy little flowers together  this pleasant home through quiet summer hours no rude hand came  gather them no chilling winds  blight warm sunbeams smiled  them  day and soft dews fell  night so here along  brookside beneath  green old trees the flowers dwelt among their friends the sunbeams   breeze one morning   flowers awoke fragrant  fresh  fair a little worm came creeping by and begged  shelter there “ah pity  love me” sighed  worm “i am lonely poor  weak a little spot   restingplace dear flowers  all i seek i am not fair  have dwelt unloved by butterfly bird  bee they little knew   this dark form lay  beauty they yet may see then let me lie   deep green moss and weave my little tomb and sleep my long unbroken sleep till spring’s first flowers come then  i come   fairer dress and your gentle care repay by  grateful love   humble worm kind flowers o let me stay” but  wild rose showed her little thorns while her soft face glowed  pride the violet hid beneath  drooping ferns and  daisy turned aside little houstonia scornfully laughed as she danced  her slender stem while  cowslip bent   rippling waves and whispered  tale  them a blueeyed grass looked down   worm as  silently turned away and cried “thou wilt harm our delicate leaves and therefore thou canst not stay” then  sweet soft voice called out  far “come hither poor worm  me the sun lies warm  this quiet spot and i’ll share my home  thee” the wondering flowers looked up  see who had offered  worm  home ’t   cloverblossom whose fluttering leaves seemed beckoning him  come it dwelt   sunny little nook where cool winds rustled by and murmuring bees  butterflies came on  flower’s breast  lie down through  leaves  sunlight stole and seemed  linger there as if  loved  brighten  home of one so sweet  fair its rosy face smiled kindly down as  friendless worm drew near and  low voice softly whispering said “poor thing thou art welcome here close  my side   soft green moss thou wilt find  quiet bed where thou canst softly sleep till spring with my leaves above thee spread i pity  love thee friendless worm though thou art not graceful or fair for many  dark unlovely form hath  kind heart dwelling there no more o’er  green  pleasant earth lonely  poor shalt thou roam for  loving friend hast thou found  me and rest  my little home” then deep   quiet mossy bed sheltered  sun  shower the grateful worm spun  winter tomb in  shadow   flower and clover guarded well  rest till autumn’s leaves  sere till all her sister flowers  gone and her winter sleep drew near then her withered leaves  softly spread o’er  sleeping worm below ere  faithful little flower lay beneath  winter snow spring came again   flowers rose from their quiet winter graves and gayly danced  their slender stems and sang   rippling waves softly  warm winds kissed their cheeks brightly  sunbeams fell as one  one they came again in their summer homes  dwell and little clover bloomed once more rosy  sweet  fair and patiently watched   mossy bed for  worm still slumbered there then her sister flowers scornfully cried as they waved   summer air “the ugly worm  friendless  poor little clover why shouldst thou care then watch no more nor dwell alone away  thy sister flowers come dance  feast  spend  us these pleasant summer hours we pity thee foolish little flower to trust what  false worm said he  not come   fairer dress for  lies   green moss dead” but little clover still watched on alone  her sunny home she did not doubt  poor worm’s truth and trusted  would come at last  small cell opened wide and  glittering butterfly from out  moss  golden wings soared up   sunny sky then  wondering flowers cried aloud “clover thy watch  vain he only sought  shelter here and never  come again” and  unkind flowers danced  joy when they saw him thus depart for  love   beautiful butterfly is dear   flower’s heart they feared  would stay  clover’s home and her tender care repay so they danced  joy when  last  rose and silently flew away then little clover bowed her head while her soft tears fell like dew for her gentle heart  grieved  find that her sisters’ words  true and  insect she had watched so long when helpless poor  lone thankless  all her faithful care on his golden wings had flown but  she drooped  silent grief she heard little daisy cry “o sisters look i see him now afar   sunny sky he  floating back  cloudland now borne   fragrant air spread wide your leaves   may choose the flower  deems most fair” then  wild rose glowed   deeper blush as she proudly waved  her stem the cowslip bent   clear blue waves and made her mirror  them little houstonia merrily danced and spread her white leaves wide while daisy whispered her joy  hope as she stood  her gay friends’ side violet peeped   tall green ferns and lifted her soft blue eye to watch  glittering form  shone afar   summer sky they thought no more   ugly worm who once had wakened their scorn but looked  longed   butterfly now as  soft wind bore him on nearer  nearer  bright form came and fairer  blossoms grew each welcomed him  her sweetest tones each offered her honey  dew but  vain did they beckon  smile  call and wider their leaves unclose the glittering form still floated on by violet daisy  rose lightly  flew   pleasant home of  flower most truly fair on clover’s breast  softly lit and folded his bright wings there “dear flower”  butterfly whispered low “long hast thou waited  me now i am come  my grateful love shall brighten thy home  thee thou hast loved  cared  me when alone hast watched o’er me long  well and now  i strive  show  thanks the poor worm could not tell sunbeam  breeze shall come  thee and  coolest dews  fall whate’er  flower can wish  thine for thou art worthy all and  home thou shared   friendless worm the butterfly’s home shall be and thou shalt find dear faithful flower a loving friend  me” then through  long bright summer hours through sunshine  through shower together  their happy home dwelt butterfly  flower “ah   very lovely” cried  elves gathering round little sunbeam  she ceased  place  garland  her hair  praise her song “now” said  queen “call hither moonlight  summerwind  they have seen many pleasant things  their long wanderings   gladly tell us them” “most joyfully  we do our best dear queen” said  elves  they folded their wings beside her “now summerwind” said moonlight “till your turn comes do you sit here  fan me while i tell this tale  little annie’s dream or the fairy flower in  large  pleasant garden sat little annie all alone  she seemed very sad  drops   not dew fell fast upon  flowers beside her who looked wonderingly up  bent still nearer  if they longed  cheer  comfort her the warm wind lifted up her shining hair  softly kissed her cheek while  sunbeams looking most kindly  her face made little rainbows  her tears  lingered lovingly about her but annie paid no heed  sun or wind or flower still  bright tears fell  she forgot all but her sorrow “little annie tell me why you weep” said  low voice  her ear and looking up  child beheld  little figure standing   vineleaf  her side  lovely face smiled  her  amid bright locks  hair  shining wings  folded   white  glittering robe  fluttered   wind “who  you lovely little thing” cried annie smiling through her tears “i am  fairy little child  am come  help  comfort you now tell me why you weep  let me  your friend” replied  spirit  she smiled more kindly still  annie’s wondering face “and  you really then  little elf such  i read   my fairy books do you ride  butterflies sleep  flowercups  live among  clouds” “yes all these things i do  many stranger still  all your fairy books can never tell but now dear annie” said  fairy bending nearer “tell me why i found no sunshine  your face why  these great drops shining   flowers  why do you sit alone when bird  bee  calling you  play” “ah you  not love me any more if i should tell you all” said annie while  tears began  fall again “i am not happy  i am not good how shall i learn    patient gentle child good little fairy  you teach me how” “gladly  i aid you annie  if you truly wish    happy child you first must learn  conquer many passions  you cherish now  make your heart  home  gentle feelings  happy thoughts  task  hard but i  give this fairy flower  help  counsel you bend hither  i may place   your breast no hand can take  hence till i unsay  spell  holds  there” as thus she spoke  elf took  her bosom  graceful flower whose snowwhite leaves shone   strange soft light “this   fairy flower” said  elf “invisible  every eye save yours now listen while i tell  power annie when your heart  filled  loving thoughts when some kindly deed  been done some duty well performed then   flower there  arise  sweetest softest fragrance  reward  gladden you but when  unkind word   your lips when  selfish angry feeling rises  your heart or  unkind cruel deed    done then  you hear  soft low chime   flowerbell listen   warning let  word remain unspoken  deed undone    quiet joy  your own heart   magic perfume  your bosom flower you  find  sweet reward” “o kind  generous fairy how can i ever thank you  this lovely gift” cried annie “i   true  listen  my little bell whenever  may ring but shall i never see you more ah if you would only stay  me i should indeed  good” “i cannot stay now little annie” said  elf “but when another spring comes round i shall  here again  see how well  fairy gift  done  work and now farewell dear child  faithful  yourself   magic flower  never fade” then  gentle fairy folded her little arms around annie’s neck laid  soft kiss  her cheek and spreading wide her shining wings flew singing up among  white clouds floating   sky and little annie sat among her flowers  watched  wondering joy  fairy blossom shining  her breast the pleasant days  spring  summer passed away   little annie’s garden autumn flowers  blooming everywhere  each day’s sun  dew growing still more beautiful  bright but  fairy flower  should have been  loveliest  all hung pale  drooping  little annie’s bosom  fragrance seemed quite gone   clear low music   warning chime rang often  her ear when first  fairy placed  there she had been pleased  her new gift    while obeyed  fairy bell  often tried  win some fragrance   flower  kind  pleasant words  actions then   fairy said she found  sweet reward   strange soft perfume   magic blossom   shone upon her breast but selfish thoughts would come  tempt her she would yield  unkind words fell  her lips  then  flower drooped pale  scentless  fairy bell rang mournfully annie would forget her better resolutions   again  selfish wilful little child at last she tried no longer but grew angry   faithful flower  would have torn   her breast but  fairy spell still held  fast  all her angry words but made  ring  louder sadder peal then she paid no heed   silvery music sounding  her ear  each day grew still more unhappy discontented  unkind so when  autumn days came round she  no better   gentle fairy’s gift  longed  spring   might  returned  now  constant echo   mournful music made her very sad one sunny morning when  fresh cool winds  blowing  not  cloud    sky little annie walked among her flowers looking carefully into each hoping thus  find  fairy who alone could take  magic blossom  her breast but she lifted up their drooping leaves peeped into their dewy cups  vain no little elf lay hidden there  she turned sadly  them all saying “i  go out into  fields  woods  seek her there i  not listen  this tiresome music more nor wear this withered flower longer” so out into  fields she went where  long grass rustled  she passed  timid birds looked  her  their nests where lovely wildflowers nodded   wind  opened wide their fragrant leaves  welcome   murmuring bees while butterflies like winged flowers danced  glittered   sun little annie looked searched  asked them all if any one could tell her   fairy whom she sought but  birds looked wonderingly  her  their soft bright eyes  still sang on  flowers nodded wisely  their stems but did not speak while butterfly  bee buzzed  fluttered away one far too busy  other too idle  stay  tell her what she asked then she went through broad fields  yellow grain  waved around her like  golden forest here crickets chirped grasshoppers leaped  busy ants worked but they could not tell her what she longed  know “now  i go among  hills” said annie “she may  there” so up  down  green hillsides went her little feet long she searched  vainly she called but still no fairy came then   riverside she went  asked  gay dragonflies   cool white lilies if  fairy had been there but  blue waves rippled   white sand  her feet  no voice answered her then into  forest little annie went   she passed along  dim cool paths  woodflowers smiled up  her face gay squirrels peeped  her  they swung amid  vines  doves cooed softly  she wandered by but none could answer her so weary  her long  useless search she sat amid  ferns  feasted   rosy strawberries  grew beside her watching meanwhile  crimson evening clouds  glowed around  setting sun the nightwind rustled through  boughs rocking  flowers  sleep  wild birds sang their evening hymns  all within  wood grew calm  still paler  paler grew  purple light lower  lower drooped little annie’s head  tall ferns bent  shield her   dew  whispering pines sang  soft lullaby  when  autumn moon rose up her silver light shone   child where pillowed  green moss she lay asleep amid  woodflowers   dim old forest and all night long beside her stood  fairy she had sought   elfin spell  charm sent   sleeping child this dream little annie dreamed she sat  her own garden  she had often sat before  angry feelings  her heart  unkind words upon her lips the magic flower  ringing  soft warning but she paid no heed  anything save her own troubled thoughts thus she sat when suddenly  low voice whispered  her ear— “little annie look  see  evil things  you  cherishing i  clothe  fitting shapes  thoughts  feelings  now dwell within your heart  you shall see how great their power becomes unless you banish them  ever” then annie saw  fear  wonder   angry words she uttered changed  dark unlovely forms each showing plainly  what fault or passion  had sprung some   shapes had scowling faces  bright fiery eyes these   spirits  anger others  sullen anxious looks seemed gathering up all they could reach  annie saw   more they gained  less they seemed  have  these she knew  shapes  selfishness spirits  pride  there who folded their shadowy garments round them  turned scornfully away  all  rest these  many others little annie saw which had come  her own heart  taken form before her eyes when first she saw them they  small  weak but  she looked they seemed  grow  gather strength  each gained  strange power over her she could not drive them  her sight  they grew ever stronger darker  more unlovely  her eyes they seemed  cast black shadows over all around  dim  sunshine blight  flowers  drive away all bright  lovely things while rising slowly round her annie saw  high dark wall  seemed  shut out everything she loved she dared not move or speak but   strange fear  her heart sat watching  dim shapes  hovered round her higher  higher rose  shadowy wall slowly  flowers near her died lingeringly  sunlight faded but  last they both  gone  left her all alone behind  gloomy wall then  spirits gathered round her whispering strange things  her ear bidding her obey   her own  she had yielded up her heart   their home  she  now their slave then she could hear no more but sinking down among  withered flowers wept sad  bitter tears  her lost liberty  joy then through  gloom there shone  faint soft light   her breast she saw her fairy flower upon whose snowwhite leaves her tears lay shining clearer  brighter grew  radiant light till  evil spirits turned away   dark shadow   wall  left  child alone the light  perfume   flower seemed  bring new strength  annie  she rose up saying  she bent  kiss  blossom  her breast “dear flower help  guide me now  i  listen  your voice  cheerfully obey my faithful fairy bell” then  her dream she felt how hard  spirits tried  tempt  trouble her  how but  her flower they would have led her back  made all dark  dreary  before long  hard she struggled  tears often fell but after each new trial brighter shone her magic flower  sweeter grew  breath while  spirits lost still more their power  tempt her meanwhile green flowering vines crept up  high dark wall  hid  roughness  her sight  over these she watched most tenderly  soon wherever green leaves  flowers bloomed  wall beneath grew weak  fell apart thus little annie worked  hoped till one  one  evil spirits fled away   their place came shining forms  gentle eyes  smiling lips who gathered round her  such loving words  brought such strength  joy  annie’s heart  nothing evil dared  enter in while slowly sank  gloomy wall and over wreaths  fragrant flowers she passed out into  pleasant world again  fairy gift no longer pale  drooping but now shining like  star upon her breast then  low voice spoke again  annie’s sleeping ear saying “the dark unlovely passions you have looked upon   your heart watch well while they  few  weak lest they should darken your whole life  shut out love  happiness  ever remember well  lesson   dream dear child  let  shining spirits make your heart their home” and   voice sounding  her ear little annie woke  find    dream but like other dreams  did not pass away   she sat alone bathed   rosy morning light  watched  forest waken into life she thought   strange forms she had seen and looking down upon  flower  her breast she silently resolved  strive  she had striven  her dream  bring back light  beauty   faded leaves  being what  fairy hoped  render her  patient gentle little child and   thought came  her mind  flower raised  drooping head and looking up into  earnest little face bent over it seemed   fragrant breath  answer annie’s silent thought  strengthen her  what might come meanwhile  forest  astir birds sang their gay goodmorrows  tree  tree while leaf  flower turned  greet  sun who rose up smiling   world  so beneath  forest boughs  through  dewy fields went little annie home better  wiser  her dream autumn flowers  dead  gone yellow leaves lay rustling   ground bleak winds went whistling through  naked trees  cold white winter snow fell softly down yet now when all without looked dark  dreary  little annie’s breast  fairy flower bloomed more beautiful than ever the memory  her forest dream had never passed away  through trial  temptation she had been true  kept her resolution still unbroken seldom now did  warning bell sound  her ear  seldom did  flower’s fragrance cease  float about her or  fairy light  brighten all whereon  fell so through  long cold winter little annie dwelt like  sunbeam  her home each day growing richer   love  others  happier  herself often  she tempted but remembering her dream she listened only   music   fairy bell   unkind thought or feeling fled away  smiling spirits  gentleness  love nestled  her heart  all  bright again so better  happier grew  child fairer  sweeter grew  flower till spring came smiling over  earth  woke  flowers set free  streams  welcomed back  birds then daily did  happy child sit among her flowers longing   gentle elf  come again  she might tell her gratitude  all  magic gift had done at length one day  she sat singing   sunny nook where all her fairest flowers bloomed weary  gazing   faroff sky   little form she hoped would come she bent  look  joyful love upon her bosom flower   she looked  folded leaves spread wide apart and rising slowly   deep white cup appeared  smiling face   lovely elf whose coming she had waited  so long “dear annie look  me no longer i am here  your own breast  you have learned  love my gift    done  work most faithfully  well”  fairy said  she looked into  happy child’s bright face  laid her little arms most tenderly about her neck “and now have i brought another gift  fairyland   fit reward  you dear child” she said when annie had told all her gratitude  love then touching  child  her shining wand  fairy bid her look  listen silently and suddenly  world seemed changed  annie   air  filled  strange sweet sounds  all around her floated lovely forms in every flower sat little smiling elves singing gayly  they rocked amid  leaves on every breeze bright airy spirits came floating by some fanned her cheek  their cool breath  waved her long hair   fro while others rang  flowerbells  made  pleasant rustling among  leaves in  fountain where  water danced  sparkled   sun astride  every drop she saw merry little spirits who plashed  floated   clear cool waves  sang  gayly   flowers  whom they scattered glittering dew the tall trees  their branches rustled   wind sang  low dreamy song while  waving grass  filled  little voices she had never heard before butterflies whispered lovely tales  her ear  birds sang cheerful songs   sweet language she had never understood before earth  air seemed filled  beauty   music she had never dreamed  until now “o tell me what  means dear fairy   another   lovelier dream or   earth  truth so beautiful  this” she cried looking  wondering joy upon  elf who lay upon  flower  her breast “yes   true dear child” replied  fairy “and few   mortals  whom we give this lovely gift what  you  now so full  music   light  others  but  pleasant summer world they never know  language  butterfly or bird or flower  they  blind  all  i have given you  power  see these fair things  your friends  playmates now  they  teach you many pleasant lessons  give you many happy hours while  garden where you once sat weeping sad  bitter tears  now brightened  your own happiness filled  loving friends  your own kindly thoughts  feelings  thus rendered  pleasant summer home   gentle happy child whose bosom flower  never fade and now dear annie i must go but every springtime   earliest flowers  i come again  visit you  bring some fairy gift guard well  magic flower  i may find all fair  bright when next i come” then   kind farewell  gentle fairy floated upward through  sunny air smiling down upon  child until she vanished   soft white clouds  little annie stood alone  her enchanted garden where all  brightened   radiant light  fragrant   perfume  her fairy flower when moonlight ceased summerwind laid down her roseleaf fan and leaning back  her acorn cup told this tale  ripple the waterspirit down   deep blue sea lived ripple  happy little waterspirit all day long she danced beneath  coral arches made garlands  bright ocean flowers or floated   great waves  sparkled   sunlight but  pastime  she loved best  lying   manycolored shells upon  shore listening   low murmuring music  waves had taught them long ago  here  hours  little spirit lay watching  sea  sky while singing gayly  herself but when tempests rose she hastened down below  stormy billows  where all  calm  still   her sister spirits waited till  should  fair again listening sadly meanwhile   cries  those whom  wild waves wrecked  cast into  angry sea  who soon came floating down pale  cold   spirits’ pleasant home then they wept pitying tears above  lifeless forms  laid them  quiet graves where flowers bloomed  jewels sparkled   sand this  ripple’s only grief  she often thought  those who sorrowed   friends they loved who now slept far down   dim  silent coral caves  gladly would she have saved  lives  those who lay around her but  great ocean  far mightier than all  tenderhearted spirits dwelling   bosom thus she could only weep  them  lay them down  sleep where no cruel waves could harm them more one day when  fearful storm raged far  wide   spirits saw great billows rolling like heavy clouds above their heads  heard  wild winds sounding far away down through  foaming waves  little child came floating  their home  eyes  closed  if  sleep  long hair fell like seaweed round  pale cold face   little hands still clasped  shells they had been gathering   beach when  great waves swept  into  troubled sea with tender tears  spirits laid  little form  rest upon  bed  flowers and singing mournful songs  if  make  sleep more calm  deep watched long  lovingly above it till  storm had died away  all  still again while ripple sang above  little child through  distant roar  winds  waves she heard  wild sorrowing voice  seemed  call  help long she listened thinking   but  echo  their own plaintive song but high above  music still sounded  sad wailing cry then stealing silently away she glided up through foam  spray till through  parting clouds  sunlight shone upon her   tranquil sky and guided   mournful sound she floated on till close before her   beach she saw  woman stretching forth her arms    sad imploring voice praying  restless sea  give her back  little child  had so cruelly borne away but  waves dashed foaming up among  bare rocks  her feet mingling their cold spray  her tears  gave no answer  her prayer when ripple saw  mother’s grief she longed  comfort her so bending tenderly beside her where she knelt upon  shore  little spirit told her how her child lay softly sleeping far down   lovely place where sorrowing tears  shed  gentle hands laid garlands over him but all  vain she whispered kindly words  weeping mother only cried— “dear spirit can you use no charm or spell  make  waves bring back my child  full  life  strength  when they swept him  my side o give me back my little child or let me lie beside him   bosom   cruel sea” “most gladly  i help you if i can though i have little power  use then grieve no more  i  search both earth  sea  find some friend who can bring back all you have lost watch daily   shore  if i do not come again then you  know my search  been  vain farewell poor mother you shall see your little child again if fairy power can win him back” and  these cheering words ripple sprang into  sea while smiling through her tears  woman watched  gentle spirit till her bright crown vanished   waves when ripple reached her home she hastened   palace   queen  told her   little child  sorrowing mother   promise she had made “good little ripple” said  queen when she had told her all “your promise never can  kept there  no power below  sea  work this charm  you can never reach  firespirits’ home  win  them  flame  warm  little body into life i pity  poor mother  would most gladly help her but alas i am  spirit like yourself  cannot serve you  i long  do” “ah dear queen if you had seen her sorrow you too would seek  keep  promise i have made i cannot let her watch  me  vain till i have done my best then tell me where  firespirits dwell  i  ask  them  flame  shall give life   little child  such great happiness   sad lonely mother tell me  path  let me go” “it  far far away high up above  sun where no spirit ever dared  venture yet” replied  queen “i cannot show  path    through  air dear ripple do not go  you can never reach  distant place some harm most surely  befall  then how shall we live without our dearest gentlest spirit stay here  us  your own pleasant home  think no more  this  i can never let you go” but ripple would not break  promise she had made  besought so earnestly   such pleading words   queen  last  sorrow gave consent  ripple joyfully prepared  go she  her sister spirits built up  tomb  delicate brightcolored shells wherein  child might lie till she should come  wake him into life then praying them  watch most faithfully above it she said farewell  floated bravely forth  her long unknown journey far away “i  search  broad earth till i find  path up   sun or some kind friend who  carry me for alas i have no wings  cannot glide through  blue air  through  sea” said ripple  herself  she went dancing over  waves which bore her swiftly onward towards  distant shore long she journeyed through  pathless ocean  no friends  cheer her save  white seabirds who went sweeping by  only stayed  dip their wide wings  her side  then flew silently away sometimes great ships sailed by  then  longing eyes did  little spirit gaze up   faces  looked down upon  sea  often they  kind  pleasant ones  she gladly would have called  them  asked them   friends but they would never understand  strange sweet language  she spoke or even see  lovely face  smiled  them above  waves her blue transparent garments  but water  their eyes   pearl chains  her hair but foam  sparkling spray so hoping   sea would  most gentle  them silently she floated  her way  left them far behind at length green hills  seen   waves gladly bore  little spirit on till rippling gently over soft white sand they left her   pleasant shore “ah what  lovely place  is” said ripple  she passed through sunny valleys where flowers began  bloom  young leaves rustled   trees “why  you all so gay dear birds” she asked  their cheerful voices sounded far  near “is there  festival over  earth  all  so beautiful  bright” “do you not know  spring  coming the warm winds whispered  days ago  we  learning  sweetest songs  welcome her when she shall come” sang  lark soaring away   music gushed  his little throat “and shall i see her violet  she journeys over  earth” asked ripple again “yes you  meet her soon   sunlight told me she  near tell her we long  see her again   waiting  welcome her back” said  blue flower dancing  joy  her stem  she nodded  smiled   spirit “i  ask spring where  firespirits dwell she travels over  earth each year  surely can show me  way” thought ripple  she went journeying on soon she saw spring come smiling over  earth sunbeams  breezes floated before  then  her white garments covered  flowers  wreaths  her hair  dewdrops  seeds falling fast  her hands  beautiful season came singing by “dear spring  you listen  help  poor little spirit who seeks far  wide   firespirits’ home” cried ripple  then told why she  there  begged her  tell what she sought “the firespirits’ home  far far away  i cannot guide you there but summer  coming behind me” said spring “and she may know better than i but i  give you  breeze  help you  your way   never tire nor fail but bear you easily over land  sea farewell little spirit i would gladly do more but voices  calling me far  wide  i cannot stay” “many thanks kind spring” cried ripple  she floated away   breeze “give  kindly word   mother who waits   shore  tell her i have not forgotten my vow but hope soon  see her again” then spring flew   her sunshine  flowers  ripple went swiftly over hill  vale till she came   land where summer  dwelling here  sun shone warmly down   early fruit  winds blew freshly over fields  fragrant hay  rustled   pleasant sound among  green leaves   forests heavy dews fell softly down  night  long bright days brought strength  beauty   blossoming earth “now i must seek  summer” said ripple  she sailed slowly through  sunny sky “i am here what would you  me little spirit” said  musical voice  her ear and floating  her side she saw  graceful form  green robes fluttering   air whose pleasant face looked kindly  her  beneath  crown  golden sunbeams  cast  warm bright glow  all beneath then ripple told her tale  asked where she should go but summer answered— “i can tell no more than my young sister spring where you may find  spirits  you seek but i too like her  give  gift  aid you take this sunbeam  my crown   cheer  brighten  most gloomy path through which you pass farewell i shall carry tidings  you   watcher   sea if  my journey round  world i find her there” and summer giving her  sunbeam passed away over  distant hills leaving all green  bright behind her so ripple journeyed  again till  earth below her shone  yellow harvests waving   sun   air  filled  cheerful voices   reapers sang among  fields or   pleasant vineyards where purple fruit hung gleaming through  leaves while  sky above  cloudless   changing foresttrees shone like  manycolored garland over hill  plain  here along  ripening cornfields  bright wreaths  crimson leaves  golden wheatears  her hair   her purple mantle stately autumn passed   happy smile  her calm face  she went scattering generous gifts  her full arms but when  wandering spirit came  her  asked  what she sought this season like  others could not tell her where  go so giving her  yellow leaf autumn said  she passed on— “ask winter little ripple when you come  his cold home  knows  firespirits well  when  comes they fly   earth  warm  comfort those dwelling there  perhaps  can tell you where they are so take this gift  mine  when you meet his chilly winds fold  about you  sit warm beneath  shelter till you come  sunlight again i  carry comfort   patient woman  my sisters have already done  tell her you  faithful still” then  went  nevertiring breeze over forest hill  field till  sky grew dark  bleak winds whistled by then ripple folded   soft warm leaf looked sadly down   earth  seemed  lie so desolate  still beneath  shroud  snow  thought how bitter cold  leaves  flowers must be   little waterspirit did not know  winter spread  soft white covering above their beds  they might safely sleep below till spring should waken them again so she went sorrowfully on till winter riding   strong northwind came rushing by   sparkling icecrown  his streaming hair while  beneath his crimson cloak where glittering frostwork shone like silver threads  scattered snowflakes far  wide “what do you seek  me fair little spirit  you come so bravely here amid my ice  snow do not fear me i am warm  heart though rude  cold without” said winter looking kindly  her while  bright smile shone like sunlight  his pleasant face   glowed  glistened   frosty air when ripple told him why she had come  pointed upward where  sunlight dimly shone through  heavy clouds saying— “far off there beside  sun   firespirits’ home   only path  up through cloud  mist it   long strange path   lonely little spirit   going  fairies  wild wilful things   their play may harm  trouble you come back  me  do not go this dangerous journey   sky i’ll gladly bear you home again if you  come” but ripple said “i cannot turn back now when i am nearly there the spirits surely  not harm me when i tell them why i am come  if i win  flame i shall   happiest spirit   sea  my promise   kept   poor mother happy once again so farewell winter speak  her gently  tell her  hope still  i shall surely come” “adieu little ripple may good angels watch above you journey bravely on  take this snowflake   never melt  my gift” winter cried   northwind bore him on leaving  cloud  falling snow behind “now dear breeze” said ripple “fly straight upward through  air until we reach  place we have so long been seeking sunbeam shall go before  light  way yellowleaf shall shelter me  heat  rain while snowflake shall lie here beside me till  comes  use so farewell   pleasant earth until we come again and now away up   sun” when ripple first began her airy journey all  dark  dreary heavy clouds lay piled like hills around her   cold mist filled  air but  sunbeam like  star lit up  way  leaf lay warmly round her   tireless wind went swiftly on higher  higher they floated up still darker  darker grew  air closer  damp mist gathered while  black clouds rolled  tossed like great waves   fro “ah” sighed  weary little spirit “shall i never see  light again or feel  warm winds  my cheek it   dreary way indeed  but   seasons’ gifts i should have perished long ago but  heavy clouds must pass away  last  all  fair again so hasten on good breeze  bring me quickly  my journey’s end” soon  cold vapors vanished  her path  sunshine shone upon her pleasantly so she went gayly on till she came up among  stars where many new strange sights    seen with wondering eyes she looked upon  bright worlds  once seemed dim  distant when she gazed upon them   sea but now they moved around her some shining   softly radiant light some circled  bright manycolored rings while others burned   red angry glare ripple would have gladly stayed  watch them longer  she fancied low sweet voices called her  lovely faces seemed  look upon her  she passed but higher up still nearer   sun she saw  faroff light  glittered like  brilliant crimson star  seemed  cast  rosy glow along  sky “the firespirits surely must  there  i must stay no longer here” said ripple so steadily she floated on till straight before her lay  broad bright path  led up   golden arch beyond which she could see shapes flitting   fro as she drew near brighter glowed  sky hotter  hotter grew  air till ripple’s leafcloak shrivelled up  could no longer shield her   heat then she unfolded  white snowflake and gladly wrapping  soft cool mantle round her entered through  shining arch through  red mist  floated all around her she could see high walls  changing light where orange blue  violet flames went flickering   fro making graceful figures  they danced  glowed  underneath these rainbow arches little spirits glided far  near wearing crowns  fire beneath which flashed their wild bright eyes   they spoke sparks dropped quickly  their lips  ripple saw  wonder through their garments  transparent light   each fairy’s breast there burned  steady flame  never wavered or went out as thus she stood  spirits gathered round her  their hot breath would have scorched her but she drew  snowcloak closer round her saying— “take me  your queen  i may tell her why i am here  ask  what i seek” so through long halls  manycolored fire they led her   spirit fairer than  rest whose crown  flames waved   fro like golden plumes while underneath her violet robe  light within her breast glowed bright  strong “this  our queen”  spirits said bending low before her  she turned her gleaming eyes upon  stranger they had brought then ripple told how she had wandered round  world  search  them how  seasons had most kindly helped her on  giving sunbeam breeze leaf  flake  how through many dangers she had come  last  ask  them  magic flame  could give life   little child again when she had told her tale  spirits whispered earnestly among themselves while sparks fell thick  fast  every word  length  firequeen said aloud— “we cannot give  flame you ask  each  us must take  part    our own breasts  this we  not do   brighter our bosomfire burns  lovelier we are so do not ask us  this thing but any other gift we  most gladly give  we feel kindly towards you   serve you if we may” but ripple asked no other boon and weeping sadly begged them not  send her back without  gift she had come so far  gain “o dear warmhearted spirits give me each  little light  your own breasts  surely they  glow  brighter  this kindly deed  i  thankfully repay  if i can” as thus she spoke  queen who had spied out  chain  jewels ripple wore upon her neck replied— “if you  give me those bright sparkling stones i  bestow  you  part  my own flame  we have no such lovely things  wear about our necks  i desire much  have them will you give  me  what i offer little spirit” joyfully ripple gave her  chain but  soon   touched her hand  jewels melted like snow  fell  bright drops   ground  this  queen’s eyes flashed   spirits gathered angrily about poor ripple who looked sadly   broken chain  thought  vain what she could give  win  thing she longed so earnestly for “i have many fairer gems than these  my home below  sea  i  bring all i can gather far  wide if you  grant my prayer  give me what i seek” she said turning gently   fiery spirits who  hovering fiercely round her “you must bring us each  jewel   never vanish  our hands  these have done” they said “and we  each give  our fire  when  child  brought  life you must bring hither all  jewels you can gather   depths   sea  we may try them here among  flames but if they melt away like these then we shall keep you prisoner till you give us back  light we lend if you consent  this then take our gift  journey home again but fail not  return or we shall seek you out” and ripple said she would consent though she knew not if  jewels could  found still thinking   promise she had made she forgot all else  told  spirits what they asked most surely should  done so each one gave  little   fire  their breasts  placed  flame   crystal vase through which  shone  glittered like  star then bidding her remember all she had promised them they led her   golden arch  said farewell so down along  shining path through mist  cloud she travelled back till far below she saw  broad blue sea she left so long ago gladly she plunged into  clear cool waves  floated back  her pleasant home where  spirits gathered joyfully about her listening  tears  smiles  she told all her many wanderings  showed  crystal vase  she had brought “now come” said they “and finish  good work you have so bravely carried on” so   quiet tomb they went where like  marble image cold  still  little child  lying then ripple placed  flame upon his breast  watched  gleam  sparkle there while light came slowly back into  once dim eyes  rosy glow shone over  pale face  breath stole through  parted lips still brighter  warmer burned  magic fire until  child awoke  his long sleep  looked  smiling wonder   faces bending over him then ripple sang  joy and  her sister spirits robed  child  graceful garments woven  bright seaweed while  his shining hair they wreathed long garlands  their fairest flowers   his little arms hung chains  brilliant shells “now come  us dear child” said ripple “we  bear you safely up into  sunlight   pleasant air  this  not your home  yonder   shore there waits  loving friend  you” so up they went through foam  spray till   beach where  fresh winds played among her falling hair   waves broke sparkling  her feet  lonely mother still stood gazing wistfully across  sea suddenly upon  great blue billow  came rolling in she saw  waterspirits smiling  her  high aloft  their white gleaming arms her child stretched forth his hands  welcome her while  little voice she so longed  hear again cried gayly— “see dear mother i am come  look what lovely things  gentle spirits gave  i might seem more beautiful  you” then gently  great wave broke  rolled back   sea leaving ripple   shore   child clasped  his mother’s arms “o faithful little spirit i would gladly give some precious gift  show my gratitude  this kind deed but i have nothing save this chain  little pearls they   tears i shed   sea  changed them thus  i might offer them  you”  happy mother said when her first joy  passed  ripple turned  go “yes i  gladly wear your gift  look upon   my fairest ornament”  waterspirit said    pearls upon her breast she left  shore where  child  playing gayly   fro   mother’s glad smile shone upon her till she sank beneath  waves and now another task    done her promise   firespirits must  kept so far  wide she searched among  caverns   sea  gathered all  brightest jewels shining there  then upon her faithful breeze once more went journeying through  sky the spirits gladly welcomed her  led her   queen before whom she poured out  sparkling gems she had gathered  such toil  care but when  spirits tried  form them into crowns they trickled  their hands like colored drops  dew  ripple saw  fear  sorrow how they melted one  one away till none  all  many she had brought remained then  firespirits looked upon her angrily  when she begged them   merciful  let her try once more saying— “do not keep me prisoner here i cannot breathe  flames  give you life  but  this snowmantle i too should melt away  vanish like  jewels  your hands o dear spirits give me some other task but let me go  this warm place where all  strange  fearful   spirit   sea” they would not listen  drew nearer saying while bright sparks showered  their lips “we  not let you go  you have promised   ours if  gems you brought proved worthless so fling away this cold white cloak  bathe  us   fire fountains  help us bring back  our bosom flames  light we gave you   child” then ripple sank down   burning floor  felt  her life  nearly done  she well knew  hot air   firepalace would  death  her the spirits gathered round  began  lift her mantle off but underneath they saw  pearl chain shining   clear soft light  only glowed more brightly when they laid their hands upon it “o give us this” cried they “it  far lovelier than all  rest  does not melt away like them  see how brilliantly  glitters  our hands if we may but have this all   well  you  once more free” and ripple safe again beneath her snow flake gladly gave  chain  them  told them how  pearls they now placed proudly  their breasts  formed  tears which but  them might still  flowing then  spirits smiled most kindly  her  would have put their arms about her  have kissed her cheek but she drew back telling them  every touch  theirs  like  wound  her “then if we may not tell our pleasure so we  show    different way  give you  pleasant journey home come out  us”  spirits said “and see  bright path we have made  you” so they led her   lofty gate  here  sky  earth  lovely rainbow arched  radiant colors   sun “this  indeed  pleasant road” said ripple “thank you friendly spirits  your care  now farewell i would gladly stay yet longer but we cannot dwell together  i am longing sadly  my own cool home now sunbeam breeze leaf  flake fly back   seasons whence you came  tell them that thanks  their kind gifts ripple’s work  last  done” then down along  shining pathway spread before her  happy little spirit glided   sea “thanks dear summerwind” said  queen “we  remember  lessons you have each taught us  when next we meet  fern dale you shall tell us more and now dear trip call them   lake   moon  sinking fast  we must hasten home” the elves gathered about their queen  while  rustling leaves  still   flowers’ sweet voices mingled  their own they sang this fairy song the moonlight fades  flower  tree and  stars dim one  one the tale  told  song  sung and  fairy feast  done the nightwind rocks  sleeping flowers and sings  them soft  low the early birds erelong  wake ’t  time   elves  go o’er  sleeping earth we silently pass unseen  mortal eye and send sweet dreams  we lightly float through  quiet moonlit sky— for  stars’ soft eyes alone may see and  flowers alone may know the feasts we hold  tales we tell so ’t  time   elves  go from bird  blossom  bee we learn  lessons they teach and seek  kindly deeds  win a loving friend  each and though unseen  earth we dwell sweet voices whisper low and gentle hearts most joyously greet the elves where’er they go when next we meet   fairy dell may  silver moon’s soft light shine then  faces gay  now and elfin hearts  light now spread each wing   eastern sky with sunlight soon  glow the morning star shall light us home farewell   elves must go as  music ceased   soft rustling sound  elves spread their shining wings  flew silently over  sleeping earth  flowers closed their bright eyes  little winds  still   feast  over   fairy lessons
