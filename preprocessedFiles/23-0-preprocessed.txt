auditory completely taken  surprise—the applause which followed   beginning   end  his felicitous remarks i think i never hated slavery so intensely    moment certainly my perception   enormous outrage which  inflicted  it   godlike nature   victims  rendered far more clear than ever there stood one  physical proportion  stature commanding  exact—in intellect richly endowed—in natural

that if mr douglass could  persuaded  consecrate his time  talents   promotion   antislavery enterprise  powerful impetus would  given  it   stunning blow   same time inflicted  northern prejudice

least   white slave can sink  low   scale  humanity   black one mr douglass  very properly chosen  write his own narrative  his own style  according   best  his ability rather than  employ some one

judgment highly creditable  his head  heart he who can peruse  without  tearful eye  heaving breast  afflicted spirit—without being filled   unutterable abhorrence  slavery  all  abettors  animated

authentic record containing it by far  larger part   slaves know  little  their ages  horses know  theirs     wish  most masters within my knowledge  keep their slaves thus ignorant i do not remember  have ever met  slave who could tell  his birthday they seldom come nearer   than plantingtime harvesttime cherrytime springtime or falltime a want  information concerning my own   source  unhappiness  me even during childhood the white children could tell their ages i could not tell why i ought   deprived   same privilege i  not allowed  make any inquiries  my master concerning it he deemed all such inquiries   part   slave improper  impertinent  evidence   restless spirit the nearest estimate i can give makes me now between twentyseven  twentyeight years  age i come  this  hearing my master say some time during  i  about seventeen years old my mother  named harriet bailey she   daughter  isaac  betsey bailey both colored  quite dark my mother    darker complexion than either my grandmother or grandfather my father   white man he  admitted   such  all i ever heard speak  my parentage the opinion  also whispered  my master  my father but   correctness  this opinion i know nothing  means  knowing  withheld  me my mother  i  separated when i  but  infant—before i knew her  my mother it   common custom   part  maryland  which i ran away  part children  their mothers   very early age frequently before  child  reached  twelfth month  mother  taken  it  hired out  some farm  considerable distance off   child  placed under  care   old woman too old  field labor for what this separation  done i do not know unless    hinder  development   child’s affection toward  mother   blunt  destroy  natural affection   mother   child this   inevitable result i never saw my mother  know her  such more than four or five times  my life  each  these times  very short  duration   night she  hired   mr stewart who lived about twelve miles  my home she made her journeys  see

contrary—a permission which they seldom get  one  gives  him  gives   proud name  being  kind master i do not recollect  ever seeing my mother   light  day she   me   night she would lie down  me  get me  sleep but long before i waked she  gone very little communication ever took place between us death soon ended what little we could have while she lived    her hardships  suffering she died when i  about seven years old  one  my master’s farms near lee’s mill i  not allowed   present during her illness  her death or burial she  gone long before i knew any thing about it never having enjoyed  any considerable extent her soothing presence her tender  watchful care i received  tidings  her death  much  same emotions i should have probably felt   death   stranger called thus suddenly away she left me without  slightest intimation  who my father was the whisper  my master  my father may or may not  true and true or false    but little consequence  my purpose whilst  fact remains  all  glaring odiousness  slaveholders have ordained   law established   children  slave women shall  all cases follow  condition  their mothers  this  done too obviously  administer  their own lusts  make  gratification  their wicked desires profitable  well  pleasurable   this cunning arrangement  slaveholder  cases not  few sustains  his slaves  double relation  master  father i know  such cases    worthy  remark  such slaves invariably suffer greater hardships  have more  contend with than others they are   first place  constant offence  their mistress she  ever disposed  find fault  them they can seldom do any thing  please her she  never better pleased than when she sees them under  lash especially when she suspects her husband  showing  his mulatto children favors which  withholds  his

disobeyed his orders  going out but had been found  company  lloyd’s ned which circumstance i found  what  said while whipping her   chief offence had  been  man  pure morals himself  might have been

colonel lloyd wore  appearance   country village all  mechanical operations  all  farms  performed here the shoemaking  mending  blacksmithing cartwrighting coopering weaving  graingrinding  all performed   slaves   home plantation the whole place wore  businesslike aspect very unlike  neighboring farms the number  houses too conspired  give  advantage over  neighboring farms it  called   slaves  great house farm few privileges  esteemed higher   slaves   outfarms than   being selected  do errands   great house farm it  associated  their minds  greatness a representative could not  prouder  his election   seat   american congress than  slave  one   outfarms would   his election  do errands   great house farm they regarded   evidence  great confidence reposed  them  their

this honor conferred upon him  most frequently the competitors  this office sought  diligently  please their overseers   officeseekers   political parties seek  please  deceive  people the same traits  character might  seen  colonel lloyd’s slaves   seen   slaves   political parties the slaves selected  go   great house farm   monthly allowance  themselves  their fellowslaves  peculiarly enthusiastic while  their way they would make  dense old woods  miles around reverberate  their wild songs revealing  once  highest joy   deepest sadness they would compose  sing  they went along consulting neither time nor tune the thought  came up came out—if not   word   sound—and  frequently   one    other they would sometimes sing  most pathetic sentiment   most rapturous tone   most rapturous sentiment   most pathetic tone into all  their songs they would manage  weave something   great house farm especially would they do this when leaving home they would then sing most exultingly  following words— “i am going away   great house farm o yea o yea o” this they would sing   chorus  words which  many would seem unmeaning jargon but which nevertheless  full  meaning  themselves i have sometimes thought   mere hearing  those songs would do more  impress some minds   horrible character  slavery than  reading  whole volumes  philosophy   subject could do i did not when  slave understand  deep meaning  those rude  apparently incoherent songs i  myself within  circle so  i neither saw nor heard  those without might see  hear they told  tale  woe which  then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension they  tones loud long  deep they breathed  prayer  complaint  souls boiling over   bitterest anguish every tone   testimony against slavery   prayer  god  deliverance  chains the hearing  those wild notes always depressed my spirit  filled me  ineffable sadness i have frequently found myself  tears while hearing them the mere recurrence  those songs even now afflicts me  while i am writing these lines  expression  feeling  already found  way down my cheek to those songs i trace my first glimmering conception   dehumanizing character  slavery i can never get rid   conception those songs still follow me  deepen my hatred  slavery  quicken my sympathies  my brethren  bonds if any one wishes   impressed   soulkilling effects  slavery let him go  colonel lloyd’s plantation and  allowanceday place himself   deep pine woods  there let him  silence analyze  sounds  shall pass through  chambers  his soul—and if   not thus impressed   only  because “there  no flesh  his obdurate heart” i have often been utterly astonished since i came   north  find persons who could speak   singing among slaves  evidence  their contentment  happiness it  impossible  conceive   greater mistake slaves sing most when they  most unhappy the songs   slave represent  sorrows  his heart    relieved  them only   aching heart  relieved   tears at least such  my experience i have often sung  drown my sorrow but seldom  express my happiness crying  joy  singing  joy  alike uncommon  me while   jaws  slavery the singing   man cast away upon  desolate island might   appropriately considered  evidence  contentment  happiness   singing   slave  songs   one    other  prompted   same emotion chapter iii colonel lloyd kept  large  finely cultivated garden which afforded almost constant employment  four men besides  chief gardener mr m’durmond this garden  probably  greatest attraction   place during  summer months people came  far  near—from baltimore easton  annapolis—to see it it abounded  fruits  almost every description   hardy apple   north   delicate orange   south this garden  not  least source  trouble   plantation its excellent fruit  quite  temptation   hungry swarms  boys  well   older slaves belonging   colonel few  whom had  virtue or  vice  resist it scarcely  day passed during  summer but  some slave had  take  lash  stealing fruit the colonel had  resort  all kinds  stratagems  keep his slaves out   garden the last  most successful one    tarring his fence all around after which if  slave  caught  any tar upon his person   deemed sufficient proof   had either been into  garden or had tried  get in in either case   severely whipped   chief gardener this plan worked well  slaves became  fearful  tar    lash they seemed  realize  impossibility  touching tar without being defiled the colonel also kept  splendid riding equipage his stable  carriagehouse presented  appearance  some  our large city livery establishments his horses    finest form  noblest blood his carriagehouse contained three splendid coaches three or four gigs besides dearborns  barouches   most fashionable style this establishment  under  care  two slaves—old barney  young barney—father  son to attend  this establishment  their sole work but    no means  easy employment   nothing  colonel lloyd more particular than   management  his horses the slightest inattention  these  unpardonable   visited upon those under whose care they  placed   severest punishment no excuse could shield them if  colonel only suspected any want  attention  his horses—a supposition which  frequently indulged  one which  course made  office  old  young barney  very trying one they never knew when they  safe  punishment they  frequently whipped when least deserving  escaped whipping when most deserving it every thing depended upon  looks   horses   state  colonel lloyd’s own mind when his horses  brought  him  use if  horse did not move fast enough or hold his head high enough   owing  some fault  his keepers it  painful  stand near  stabledoor  hear  various complaints against  keepers when  horse  taken out  use “this horse  not had proper attention he  not been sufficiently rubbed  curried or   not been properly fed his food  too wet or too dry  got  too soon or too late   too hot or too cold  had too much hay  not enough  grain or  had too much grain  not enough  hay instead  old barney’s attending   horse  had very improperly left   his son” to all these complaints no matter how unjust  slave must answer never  word colonel lloyd could not brook any contradiction   slave when  spoke  slave must stand listen  tremble  such  literally  case i have seen colonel lloyd make old barney  man between fifty  sixty years  age uncover his bald head kneel down upon  cold damp ground  receive upon his naked  toilworn shoulders more than thirty lashes   time colonel lloyd had three sons—edward murray  daniel—and three sonsinlaw mr winder mr nicholson  mr lowndes all  these lived   great house farm  enjoyed  luxury  whipping  servants when they pleased  old barney down  william wilkes  coachdriver i have seen winder make one   houseservants stand off  him  suitable distance   touched   end  his whip   every stroke raise great ridges upon his back to describe  wealth  colonel lloyd would  almost equal  describing  riches  job he kept  ten  fifteen houseservants he  said  own  thousand slaves  i think this estimate quite within  truth colonel lloyd owned so many   did not know them when  saw them nor did all  slaves   outfarms know him it  reported  him that while riding along  road one day  met  colored man  addressed him   usual manner  speaking  colored people   public highways   south “well boy whom do you belong to” “to colonel lloyd” replied  slave “well does  colonel treat you well” “no sir”   ready reply “what does  work you too hard” “yes sir” “well don’t  give you enough  eat” “yes sir  gives me enough such   is” the colonel after ascertaining where  slave belonged rode on  man also went  about his business not dreaming   had been conversing  his master he thought said  heard nothing more   matter until two or three weeks afterwards the poor man  then informed  his overseer that  having found fault  his master   now   sold   georgia trader he  immediately chained  handcuffed  thus without  moment’s warning   snatched away  forever sundered  his family  friends   hand more unrelenting than death this   penalty  telling  truth  telling  simple truth  answer   series  plain questions it  partly  consequence  such facts  slaves when inquired    their condition   character  their masters almost universally say they  contented   their masters  kind the slaveholders have been known  send  spies among their slaves  ascertain their views  feelings  regard  their condition the frequency  this  had  effect  establish among  slaves  maxim   still tongue makes  wise head they suppress  truth rather than take  consequences  telling it   so doing prove themselves  part   human family if they have any thing  say  their masters   generally  their masters’ favor especially when speaking   untried man i have been frequently asked when  slave if i had  kind master  do not remember ever  have given  negative answer nor did i  pursuing this course consider myself  uttering what  absolutely false  i always measured  kindness  my master   standard  kindness set up among slaveholders around us moreover slaves  like other people  imbibe prejudices quite common  others they think their own better than   others many under  influence  this prejudice think their own masters  better than  masters  other slaves  this too  some cases when  very reverse  true indeed   not uncommon  slaves even  fall out  quarrel among themselves about  relative goodness  their masters each contending   superior goodness  his own over    others at  very same time they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately it  so  our plantation when colonel lloyd’s slaves met  slaves  jacob jepson they seldom parted without  quarrel about their masters colonel lloyd’s slaves contending     richest  mr jepson’s slaves     smartest  most   man colonel lloyd’s slaves would boast his ability  buy  sell jacob jepson mr jepson’s slaves would boast his ability  whip colonel lloyd these quarrels would almost always end   fight between  parties  those  whipped  supposed  have gained  point  issue they seemed  think   greatness  their masters  transferable  themselves it  considered  being bad enough    slave but    poor man’s slave  deemed  disgrace indeed chapter iv mr hopkins remained but  short time   office  overseer why his career  so short i do not know but suppose  lacked  necessary severity  suit colonel lloyd mr hopkins  succeeded  mr austin gore  man possessing   eminent degree all those traits  character indispensable  what  called  firstrate overseer mr gore had served colonel lloyd   capacity  overseer upon one   outfarms  had shown himself worthy   high station  overseer upon  home or great house farm mr gore  proud ambitious  persevering he  artful cruel  obdurate he  just  man  such  place    just  place  such  man it afforded scope   full exercise  all his powers   seemed   perfectly  home  it he  one  those who could torture  slightest look word or gesture   part   slave into impudence  would treat  accordingly there must  no answering back  him no explanation  allowed  slave showing himself  have been wrongfully accused mr gore acted fully up   maxim laid down  slaveholders—“it  better   dozen slaves should suffer under  lash than   overseer should  convicted   presence   slaves  having been  fault” no matter how innocent  slave might be—it availed him nothing when accused  mr gore  any misdemeanor to  accused    convicted    convicted    punished  one always following  other  immutable certainty to escape punishment   escape accusation  few slaves had  fortune  do either under  overseership  mr gore he  just proud enough  demand  most debasing homage   slave  quite servile enough  crouch himself   feet   master he  ambitious enough   contented  nothing short   highest rank  overseers  persevering enough  reach  height  his ambition he  cruel enough  inflict  severest punishment artful enough  descend   lowest trickery  obdurate enough   insensible   voice   reproving conscience he was  all  overseers  most dreaded   slaves his presence  painful his eye flashed confusion  seldom  his sharp shrill voice heard without producing horror  trembling  their ranks mr gore   grave man and though  young man  indulged  no jokes said no funny words seldom smiled his words   perfect keeping  his looks  his looks   perfect keeping  his words overseers  sometimes indulge   witty word even   slaves not so  mr gore he spoke but  command  commanded but   obeyed  dealt sparingly  his words  bountifully  his whip never using  former where  latter would answer  well when  whipped  seemed  do so   sense  duty  feared no consequences he did nothing reluctantly no matter how disagreeable always  his post never inconsistent he never promised but  fulfil he was   word  man   most inflexible firmness  stonelike coolness his savage barbarity  equalled only   consummate coolness  which  committed  grossest  most savage deeds upon  slaves under his charge mr gore once undertook  whip one  colonel lloyd’s slaves   name  demby he had given demby but few stripes when  get rid   scourging  ran  plunged himself into  creek  stood there   depth  his shoulders refusing  come out mr gore told him   would give him three calls  that if  did not come out   third call  would shoot him the first call  given demby made no response but stood his ground the second  third calls  given   same result mr gore then without consultation or deliberation  any one not even giving demby  additional call raised his musket  his face taking deadly aim  his standing victim    instant poor demby  no more his mangled body sank out  sight  blood  brains marked  water where  had stood a thrill  horror flashed through every soul upon  plantation excepting mr gore he alone seemed cool  collected he  asked  colonel lloyd  my old master why  resorted  this extraordinary expedient his reply was as well  i can remember  demby had become unmanageable he  setting  dangerous example   other slaves—one which if suffered  pass without some such demonstration  his part would finally lead   total subversion  all rule  order upon  plantation he argued  if one slave refused   corrected  escaped  his life  other slaves would soon copy  example  result  which would be  freedom   slaves   enslavement   whites mr gore’s defence  satisfactory he  continued  his station  overseer upon  home plantation his fame   overseer went abroad his horrid crime  not even submitted  judicial investigation it  committed   presence  slaves  they  course could neither institute  suit nor testify against him  thus  guilty perpetrator  one   bloodiest  most foul murders goes unwhipped  justice  uncensured   community  which  lives mr gore lived  st michael’s talbot county maryland when i left there  if   still alive  very probably lives there now  if so   now    then  highly esteemed   much respected  though his guilty soul had not been stained  his brother’s blood i speak advisedly when i say this—that killing  slave or any colored person  talbot county maryland  not treated   crime either   courts or  community mr thomas lanman  st michael’s killed two slaves one  whom  killed   hatchet  knocking his brains out he used  boast   commission   awful  bloody deed i have heard him do so laughingly saying among other things     only benefactor  his country   company   when others would do  much   had done we should  relieved  “the d——d niggers” the wife  mr giles hicks living but  short distance  where i used  live murdered my wife’s cousin  young girl between fifteen  sixteen years  age mangling her person   most horrible manner breaking her nose  breastbone   stick so   poor girl expired   few hours afterward she  immediately buried but had not been  her untimely grave but  few hours before she  taken up  examined   coroner who decided  she had come  her death  severe beating the offence  which this girl  thus murdered  this—she had been set  night  mind mrs hicks’s baby  during  night she fell asleep   baby cried she having lost her rest  several nights previous did not hear  crying they  both   room  mrs hicks mrs hicks finding  girl slow  move jumped  her bed seized  oak stick  wood   fireplace    broke  girl’s nose  breastbone  thus ended her life i  not say  this most horrid murder produced no sensation   community it did produce sensation but not enough  bring  murderess  punishment there   warrant issued  her arrest but   never served thus she escaped not only punishment but even  pain  being arraigned before  court  her horrid crime whilst i am detailing bloody deeds which took place during my stay  colonel lloyd’s plantation i  briefly narrate another which occurred about  same time   murder  demby  mr gore colonel lloyd’s slaves    habit  spending  part  their nights  sundays  fishing  oysters   this way made up  deficiency  their scanty allowance an old man belonging  colonel lloyd while thus engaged happened  get beyond  limits  colonel lloyd’s    premises  mr beal bondly at this trespass mr bondly took offence   his musket came down   shore  blew  deadly contents into  poor old man mr bondly came over  see colonel lloyd  next day whether  pay him  his property or  justify himself  what  had done i know not at any rate this whole fiendish transaction  soon hushed up there  very little said about   all  nothing done it   common saying even among little white boys    worth  halfcent  kill  “nigger”   halfcent  bury one chapter v as  my own treatment while i lived  colonel lloyd’s plantation   very similar     other slave children i  not old enough  work   field  there being little else than field work  do i had  great deal  leisure time the most i had  do   drive up  cows  evening keep  fowls out   garden keep  front yard clean  run  errands  my old master’s daughter mrs lucretia auld the most  my leisure time i spent  helping master daniel lloyd  finding his birds after  had shot them my connection  master daniel   some advantage  me he became quite attached  me    sort  protector  me he would not allow  older boys  impose upon me  would divide his cakes  me i  seldom whipped  my old master  suffered little  any thing else than hunger  cold i suffered much  hunger but much more  cold in hottest summer  coldest winter i  kept almost naked—no shoes no stockings no jacket no trousers nothing  but  coarse tow linen shirt reaching only  my knees i had no bed i must have perished  cold but that  coldest nights i used  steal  bag which  used  carrying corn   mill i would crawl into this bag  there sleep   cold damp clay floor  my head   feet out my feet have been so cracked   frost   pen  which i am writing might  laid   gashes we  not regularly allowanced our food  coarse corn meal boiled this  called mush it  put into  large wooden tray or trough  set down upon  ground the children  then called like so many pigs  like so many pigs they would come  devour  mush some  oystershells others  pieces  shingle some  naked hands  none  spoons he  ate fastest got most    strongest secured  best place  few left  trough satisfied i  probably between seven  eight years old when i left colonel lloyd’s plantation i left   joy i shall never forget  ecstasy  which i received  intelligence  my old master anthony had determined  let me go  baltimore  live  mr hugh auld brother  my old master’s soninlaw captain thomas auld i received this information about three days before my departure they  three   happiest days i ever enjoyed i spent  most part  all these three days   creek washing off  plantation scurf  preparing myself  my departure the pride  appearance which this would indicate  not my own i spent  time  washing not so much because i wished to but because mrs lucretia had told me i must get all  dead skin off my feet  knees before i could go  baltimore   people  baltimore  very cleanly  would laugh  me if i looked dirty besides she  going  give me  pair  trousers which i should not put  unless i got all  dirt off me the thought  owning  pair  trousers  great indeed it  almost  sufficient motive not only  make me take off what would  called  pigdrovers  mange but  skin itself i went    good earnest working   first time   hope  reward the ties  ordinarily bind children  their homes  all suspended  my case i found no severe trial  my departure my home  charmless   not home  me  parting  it i could not feel  i  leaving any thing which i could have enjoyed  staying my mother  dead my grandmother lived far off so  i seldom saw her i had two sisters  one brother  lived   same house  me but  early separation  us  our mother had well nigh blotted  fact  our relationship  our memories i looked  home elsewhere   confident  finding none which i should relish less than  one which i  leaving if however i found  my new home hardship hunger whipping  nakedness i had  consolation  i should not have escaped any one  them  staying having already had more than  taste  them   house  my old master  having endured them there i very naturally inferred my ability  endure them elsewhere  especially  baltimore  i had something   feeling about baltimore   expressed   proverb  “being hanged  england  preferable  dying  natural death  ireland” i had  strongest desire  see baltimore cousin tom though not fluent  speech had inspired me   desire  his eloquent description   place i could never point out any thing   great house no matter how beautiful or powerful but   had seen something  baltimore far exceeding both  beauty  strength  object which i pointed out  him even  great house itself  all  pictures  far inferior  many buildings  baltimore so strong  my desire  i thought  gratification   would fully compensate  whatever loss  comforts i should sustain   exchange i left without  regret    highest hopes  future happiness we sailed out  miles river  baltimore   saturday morning i remember only  day   week    time i had no knowledge   days   month nor  months   year on setting sail i walked aft  gave  colonel lloyd’s plantation what i hoped would   last look i then placed myself   bows   sloop  there spent  remainder   day  looking ahead interesting myself  what    distance rather than  things near  or behind in  afternoon   day we reached annapolis  capital   state we stopped but  few moments so  i had no time  go  shore it   first large town  i had ever seen  though  would look small compared  some  our new england factory villages i thought   wonderful place   size—more imposing even than  great house farm we arrived  baltimore early  sunday morning landing  smith’s wharf not far  bowley’s wharf we had  board  sloop  large flock  sheep  after aiding  driving them   slaughterhouse  mr curtis  louden slater’s hill i  conducted  rich one   hands belonging  board   sloop  my new home  alliciana street near mr gardner’s shipyard  fells point mr  mrs auld  both  home  met me   door  their little son thomas  take care  whom i had been given and here i saw what i had never seen before    white face beaming   most kindly emotions    face  my new mistress sophia auld i wish i could describe  rapture  flashed through my soul  i beheld it it   new  strange sight  me brightening up my pathway   light  happiness little thomas  told there  his freddy—and i  told  take care  little thomas  thus i entered upon  duties  my new home   most cheering prospect ahead i look upon my departure  colonel lloyd’s plantation  one   most interesting events  my life it  possible  even quite probable  but   mere circumstance  being removed   plantation  baltimore i should have today instead  being here seated  my own table   enjoyment  freedom   happiness  home writing this narrative been confined   galling chains  slavery going  live  baltimore laid  foundation  opened  gateway  all my subsequent prosperity i have ever regarded    first plain manifestation   kind providence which  ever since attended me  marked my life  so many favors i regarded  selection  myself  being somewhat remarkable there   number  slave children  might have been sent   plantation  baltimore there  those younger those older  those   same age i  chosen  among them all    first last  only choice i may  deemed superstitious  even egotistical  regarding this event   special interposition  divine providence  my favor but i should  false   earliest sentiments  my soul if i suppressed  opinion i prefer   true  myself even   hazard  incurring  ridicule  others rather than   false  incur my own abhorrence from my earliest recollection i date  entertainment   deep conviction  slavery would not always  able  hold me within  foul embrace    darkest hours  my career  slavery this living word  faith  spirit  hope departed not  me but remained like ministering angels  cheer me through  gloom this good spirit   god   him i offer thanksgiving  praise chapter vi my new mistress proved   all she appeared when i first met her   door—a woman   kindest heart  finest feelings she had never had  slave under her control previously  myself  prior  her marriage she had been dependent upon her own industry   living she   trade  weaver   constant application  her business she had been   good degree preserved   blighting  dehumanizing effects  slavery i  utterly astonished  her goodness i scarcely knew how  behave towards her she  entirely unlike any other white woman i had ever seen i could not approach her  i  accustomed  approach other white ladies my early instruction  all out  place the crouching servility usually so acceptable  quality   slave did not answer when manifested toward her her favor  not gained  it she seemed   disturbed  it she did not deem  impudent or unmannerly   slave  look her   face the meanest slave  put fully  ease  her presence  none left without feeling better  having seen her her face  made  heavenly smiles  her voice  tranquil music but alas this kind heart had but  short time  remain such the fatal poison  irresponsible power  already  her hands  soon commenced  infernal work that cheerful eye under  influence  slavery soon became red  rage  voice made all  sweet accord changed  one  harsh  horrid discord   angelic face gave place     demon very soon after i went  live  mr  mrs auld she very kindly commenced  teach me  a b c after i had learned this she assisted me  learning  spell words  three or four letters just  this point  my progress mr auld found out what  going on   once forbade mrs auld  instruct me further telling her among other things    unlawful  well  unsafe  teach  slave  read to use his own words further  said “if you give  nigger  inch   take  ell a nigger should know nothing but  obey his master—to do    told  do learning would spoil  best nigger   world now” said he “if you teach  nigger speaking  myself how  read there would  no keeping him it would forever unfit him    slave he would  once become unmanageable   no value  his master as  himself  could do him no good but  great deal  harm it would make him discontented  unhappy” these words sank deep into my heart stirred up sentiments within  lay slumbering  called into existence  entirely new train  thought it   new  special revelation explaining dark  mysterious things  which my youthful understanding had struggled but struggled  vain i now understood what had been  me  most perplexing difficulty—to wit  white man’s power  enslave  black man it   grand achievement  i prized  highly from  moment i understood  pathway  slavery  freedom it  just what i wanted  i got    time when i  least expected it whilst i  saddened   thought  losing  aid  my kind mistress i  gladdened   invaluable instruction which   merest accident i had gained  my master though conscious   difficulty  learning without  teacher i set out  high hope   fixed purpose  whatever cost  trouble  learn how  read the very decided manner  which  spoke  strove  impress his wife   evil consequences  giving me instruction served  convince me    deeply sensible   truths   uttering it gave me  best assurance  i might rely   utmost confidence   results which  said would flow  teaching me  read what  most dreaded  i most desired what  most loved  i most hated that which  him   great evil   carefully shunned   me  great good   diligently sought   argument which  so warmly urged against my learning  read only served  inspire me   desire  determination  learn in learning  read i owe almost  much   bitter opposition  my master    kindly aid  my mistress i acknowledge  benefit  both i had resided but  short time  baltimore before i observed  marked difference   treatment  slaves   which i had witnessed

feeds his slaves well    due  them  say  most  them do give their slaves enough  eat there are however some painful exceptions  this rule directly opposite  us  philpot street lived mr thomas hamilton he owned two slaves their names  henrietta  mary henrietta  about twentytwo years  age mary  about fourteen   all  mangled  emaciated creatures i ever looked upon these two   most so his heart must  harder than stone  could look upon these unmoved the head neck  shoulders  mary  literally cut  pieces i have frequently felt her head  found  nearly covered  festering sores caused   lash  her cruel mistress i do not know  her master ever whipped her but i have been  eyewitness   cruelty  mrs hamilton i used    mr hamilton’s house nearly every day mrs hamilton used  sit   large chair   middle   room   heavy cowskin always  her side  scarce  hour passed during  day but  marked   blood  one  these slaves the girls seldom passed her without her saying “move faster you black gip”   same time giving them  blow   cowskin over  head or shoulders often drawing  blood she would then say “take that you black gip” continuing “if you don’t move faster i’ll move you” added   cruel lashings  which these slaves  subjected they  kept nearly halfstarved they seldom knew what    eat  full meal i have seen mary contending   pigs   offal thrown into  street so much  mary kicked  cut  pieces  she  oftener called “pecked” than  her name chapter vii i lived  master hugh’s family about seven years during this time i succeeded  learning  read  write in accomplishing this i  compelled  resort  various stratagems i had no regular teacher my mistress who had kindly commenced  instruct me had  compliance   advice  direction  her husband not only ceased  instruct but had set her face against my being instructed  any one else it  due however  my mistress  say  her  she did not adopt this course  treatment immediately she  first lacked  depravity indispensable  shutting me up  mental darkness it   least necessary  her  have some training   exercise  irresponsible power  make her equal   task  treating me  though i   brute my mistress was  i have said  kind  tenderhearted woman    simplicity  her soul she commenced when i first went  live  her  treat me  she supposed one human being ought  treat another in entering upon  duties   slaveholder she did not seem  perceive  i sustained  her  relation   mere chattel    her  treat me   human being  not only wrong but dangerously so slavery proved  injurious  her   did  me when i went there she   pious warm  tenderhearted woman there  no sorrow or suffering  which she had not  tear she had bread   hungry clothes   naked  comfort  every mourner  came within her reach slavery soon proved  ability  divest her  these heavenly qualities under  influence  tender heart became stone   lamblike disposition gave way  one  tigerlike fierceness the first step  her downward course   her ceasing  instruct me she now commenced  practise her husband’s precepts she finally became even more violent  her opposition than her husband himself she  not satisfied  simply doing  well   had commanded she seemed anxious  do better nothing seemed  make her more angry than  see me   newspaper she seemed  think  here lay  danger i have had her rush  me   face made all up  fury  snatch  me  newspaper   manner  fully revealed her apprehension she   apt woman   little experience soon demonstrated  her satisfaction  education  slavery  incompatible  each other from this time i  most narrowly watched if i    separate room any considerable length  time i  sure   suspected  having  book    once called  give  account  myself all this however  too late the first step had been taken mistress  teaching me  alphabet had given me  inch  no precaution could prevent me  taking  ell the plan which i adopted   one  which i  most successful    making friends  all  little white boys whom i met   street as many  these  i could i converted into teachers with their kindly aid obtained  different times   different places i finally succeeded  learning  read when i  sent  errands i always took my book  me   going one part  my errand quickly i found time  get  lesson before my return i used also  carry bread  me enough  which  always   house   which i  always welcome  i  much better off  this regard than many   poor white children  our neighborhood this bread i used  bestow upon  hungry little urchins who  return would give me  more valuable bread  knowledge i am strongly tempted  give  names  two or three  those little boys   testimonial   gratitude  affection i bear them but prudence forbids—not   would injure me but  might embarrass them    almost  unpardonable offence  teach slaves  read  this christian country it  enough  say   dear little fellows  they lived  philpot street very near durgin  bailey’s shipyard i used  talk this matter  slavery over  them i would sometimes say  them i wished i could   free  they would  when they got   men “you   free  soon  you  twentyone but i am  slave  life have not i  good  right   free  you have” these words used  trouble them they would express  me  liveliest sympathy  console me   hope  something would occur  which i might  free i  now about twelve years old   thought  being a slave  life began  bear heavily upon my heart just about this time i got hold   book entitled “the columbian orator” every opportunity i got i used  read this book among much  other interesting matter i found    dialogue between  master  his slave the slave  represented  having run away  his master three times the dialogue represented  conversation which took place between them when  slave  retaken  third time in this dialogue  whole argument  behalf  slavery  brought forward   master all  which  disposed    slave the slave  made  say some very smart  well  impressive things  reply  his master—things which had  desired though unexpected effect   conversation resulted   voluntary emancipation   slave   part   master in  same book i met  one  sheridan’s mighty speeches    behalf  catholic emancipation these  choice documents  me i read them over  over again  unabated interest they gave tongue  interesting thoughts  my own soul which had frequently flashed through my mind  died away  want  utterance the moral which i gained   dialogue   power  truth over  conscience  even  slaveholder what i got  sheridan   bold denunciation  slavery   powerful vindication  human rights the reading  these documents enabled me  utter my thoughts   meet  arguments brought forward  sustain slavery but while they relieved me  one difficulty they brought  another even more painful than  one  which i  relieved the more i read  more i  led  abhor  detest my enslavers i could regard them  no other light than  band  successful robbers who had left their homes  gone  africa  stolen us  our homes    strange land reduced us  slavery i loathed them  being  meanest  well   most wicked  men as i read  contemplated  subject behold  very discontentment which master hugh had predicted would follow my learning  read had already come  torment  sting my soul  unutterable anguish as i writhed under it i would  times feel  learning  read had been  curse rather than  blessing it had given me  view  my wretched condition without  remedy it opened my eyes   horrible pit but  no ladder upon which  get out in moments  agony i envied my fellowslaves  their stupidity i have often wished myself  beast i preferred  condition   meanest reptile  my own any thing no matter what  get rid  thinking it  this everlasting thinking  my condition  tormented me there  no getting rid  it it  pressed upon me  every object within sight or hearing animate or inanimate the silver trump  freedom had roused my soul  eternal wakefulness freedom now appeared  disappear no more forever it  heard  every sound  seen  every thing it  ever present  torment me   sense  my wretched condition i saw nothing without seeing it i heard nothing without hearing it  felt nothing without feeling it it looked  every star  smiled  every calm breathed  every wind  moved  every storm i often found myself regretting my own existence  wishing myself dead  but   hope  being free i have no doubt but  i should have killed myself or done something  which i should have been killed while  this state  mind i  eager  hear any one speak  slavery i   ready listener every little while i could hear something about  abolitionists it  some time before i found what  word meant it  always used  such connections   make   interesting word  me if  slave ran away  succeeded  getting clear or if  slave killed his master set fire   barn or did any thing very wrong   mind   slaveholder   spoken    fruit  abolition hearing  word  this connection very often i set about learning what  meant the dictionary afforded me little or no help i found   “the act  abolishing” but then i did not know what    abolished here i  perplexed i did not dare  ask any one about  meaning  i  satisfied    something they wanted me  know very little about after  patient waiting i got one  our city papers containing  account   number  petitions   north praying   abolition  slavery   district  columbia    slave trade between  states from this time i understood  words abolition  abolitionist  always drew near when  word  spoken expecting  hear something  importance  myself  fellowslaves the light broke  upon me  degrees i went one day down   wharf  mr waters  seeing two irishmen unloading  scow  stone i went unasked  helped them when we had finished one  them came  me  asked me if i   slave i told him i was he asked “are ye  slave  life” i told him  i was the good irishman seemed   deeply affected   statement he said   other     pity so fine  little fellow  myself should   slave  life he said    shame  hold me they both advised me  run away   north  i should find friends there   i should  free i pretended not   interested  what they said  treated them  if i did not understand them  i feared they might  treacherous white men have been known  encourage slaves  escape  then  get  reward catch them  return them  their masters i  afraid  these seemingly good men might use me so but i nevertheless remembered their advice    time i resolved  run away i looked forward   time  which  would  safe  me  escape i  too young  think  doing so immediately besides i wished  learn how  write  i might have occasion  write my own pass i consoled myself   hope  i should one day find  good chance meanwhile i would learn  write the idea   how i might learn  write  suggested  me  being  durgin  bailey’s shipyard  frequently seeing  ship carpenters after hewing  getting  piece  timber ready  use write   timber  name   part   ship  which   intended when  piece  timber  intended   larboard side  would  marked thus—“l” when  piece    starboard side  would  marked thus—“s” a piece   larboard side forward would  marked thus—“l f” when  piece   starboard side forward  would  marked thus—“s f” for larboard aft  would  marked thus—“l a” for starboard aft  would  marked thus—“s a” i soon learned  names  these letters   what they  intended when placed upon  piece  timber   shipyard i immediately commenced copying them    short time  able  make  four letters named after that when i met  any boy who i knew could write i would tell him i could write  well  he the next word would be “i don’t believe you let me see you try it” i would then make  letters which i had been so fortunate   learn  ask him  beat that in this way i got  good many lessons  writing which   quite possible i should never have gotten  any other way during this time my copybook   board fence brick wall  pavement my pen  ink   lump  chalk with these i learned mainly how  write i then commenced  continued copying  italics  webster’s spelling book until i could make them all without looking   book by this time my little master thomas had gone  school  learned how  write  had written over  number  copybooks these had been brought home  shown  some  our near neighbors  then laid aside my mistress used  go  class meeting   wilk street meetinghouse every monday afternoon  leave me  take care   house when left thus i used  spend  time  writing   spaces left  master thomas’s copybook copying what  had written i continued  do this until i could write  hand very similar    master thomas thus after  long tedious effort  years i finally succeeded  learning how  write chapter viii in  very short time after i went  live  baltimore my old master’s youngest son richard died   about three years  six months after his death my old master captain anthony died leaving only his son andrew  daughter lucretia  share his estate he died while   visit  see his daughter  hillsborough cut off thus unexpectedly  left no     disposal  his property it  therefore necessary  have  valuation   property   might  equally divided between mrs lucretia  master andrew i  immediately sent for   valued   other property here again my feelings rose up  detestation  slavery i had now  new conception  my degraded condition prior  this i had become if not insensible  my lot  least partly so i left baltimore   young heart overborne  sadness   soul full  apprehension i took passage  captain rowe   schooner wild cat and after  sail  about twentyfour hours i found myself near  place  my birth i had now been absent   almost if not quite five years i however remembered  place very well i  only about five years old when i left it  go  live  my old master  colonel lloyd’s plantation so  i  now between ten  eleven years old we  all ranked together   valuation men  women old  young married  single  ranked  horses sheep  swine there  horses  men cattle  women pigs  children all holding  same rank   scale  being   all subjected   same narrow examination silveryheaded age  sprightly youth maids  matrons had  undergo  same indelicate inspection at this moment i saw more clearly than ever  brutalizing effects  slavery upon both slave  slaveholder after  valuation then came  division i have no language  express  high excitement  deep anxiety which  felt among us poor slaves during this time our fate  life  now   decided we had no more voice   decision than  brutes among whom we  ranked a single word   white men  enough—against all our wishes prayers  entreaties—to sunder forever  dearest friends dearest kindred  strongest ties known  human beings in addition   pain  separation there   horrid dread  falling into  hands  master andrew he  known  us all  being  most cruel wretch—a common drunkard who had  his reckless mismanagement  profligate dissipation already wasted  large portion  his father’s property we all felt  we might  well  sold  once   georgia traders   pass into his hands  we knew   would  our inevitable condition—a condition held  us all   utmost horror  dread i suffered more anxiety than most  my fellowslaves i had known what     kindly treated they had known nothing   kind they had seen little or nothing   world they   very deed men  women  sorrow  acquainted  grief their backs had been made familiar   bloody lash so  they had become callous mine  yet tender  while  baltimore i got few whippings  few slaves could boast   kinder master  mistress than myself   thought  passing out  their hands into those  master andrew—a man who but  few days before  give me  sample  his bloody disposition took my little brother   throat threw him   ground    heel  his boot stamped upon his head till  blood gushed  his nose  ears—was well calculated  make me anxious   my fate after  had committed this savage outrage upon my brother  turned  me  said    way  meant  serve me one  these days—meaning i suppose when i came into his possession thanks   kind providence i fell   portion  mrs lucretia   sent immediately back  baltimore  live again   family  master hugh their joy  my return equalled their sorrow  my departure it   glad day  me i had escaped  worse than lion’s jaws i  absent  baltimore   purpose  valuation  division just about one month   seemed  have been six very soon after my return  baltimore my mistress lucretia died leaving her husband  one child amanda    very short time after her death master andrew died now all  property  my old master slaves included    hands  strangers—strangers who had had nothing  do  accumulating it not  slave  left free all remained slaves   youngest   oldest if any one thing  my experience more than another served  deepen my conviction   infernal character  slavery   fill me  unutterable loathing  slaveholders   their base ingratitude  my poor old grandmother she had served my old master faithfully  youth  old age she had been  source  all his wealth she had peopled his plantation  slaves she had become  great grandmother  his service she had rocked him  infancy attended him  childhood served him through life   his death wiped  his icy brow  cold deathsweat  closed his eyes forever she  nevertheless left  slave—a slave  life—a slave   hands  strangers   their hands she saw her children her grandchildren  her greatgrandchildren divided like so many sheep without being gratified   small privilege   single word   their or her own destiny and  cap  climax  their base ingratitude  fiendish barbarity my grandmother who  now very old having outlived my old master  all his children having seen  beginning  end  all  them  her present owners finding she   but little value her frame already racked   pains  old age  complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs they took her   woods built her  little hut put up  little mudchimney  then made her welcome   privilege

 mrs lucretia master thomas married his second wife her name  rowena hamilton she   eldest daughter  mr william hamilton master now lived  st michael’s not long after his marriage  misunderstanding took place between himself  master hugh    means  punishing his brother  took me  him  live  himself  st michael’s here i underwent another most painful separation it however  not so severe   one i dreaded   division  property for during this interval  great change had taken place  master hugh  his once kind  affectionate wife the influence  brandy upon him   slavery upon her had effected  disastrous change   characters  both so that  far  they  concerned i thought i had little  lose   change but   not  them  i  attached it   those little baltimore boys  i felt  strongest attachment i had received many good lessons  them   still receiving them   thought  leaving them  painful indeed i  leaving too without  hope  ever being allowed  return master thomas had said  would never let me return again the barrier betwixt himself  brother  considered impassable i then had  regret  i did not  least make  attempt  carry out my resolution  run away   chances  success  tenfold greater   city than   country i sailed  baltimore  st michael’s   sloop amanda captain edward dodson on my passage i paid particular attention   direction which  steamboats took  go  philadelphia i found instead  going down  reaching north point they went up  bay   northeasterly direction i deemed this knowledge   utmost importance my determination  run away  again revived i resolved  wait only so long   offering   favorable opportunity when  came i  determined   off chapter ix i have now reached  period  my life when i can give dates i left baltimore  went  live  master thomas auld  st michael’s  march  it  now more than seven years since i lived  him   family  my old master  colonel lloyd’s plantation we  course  now almost entire strangers  each other he   me  new master  i  him  new slave i  ignorant  his temper  disposition   equally so  mine a very short time however brought us into full acquaintance  each other i  made acquainted  his wife not less than  himself they  well matched being equally mean  cruel i  now   first time during  space  more than seven years made  feel  painful gnawings  hunger—a something which i had not experienced before since i left colonel lloyd’s plantation it went hard enough  me then when i could look back  no period  which i had enjoyed  sufficiency it  tenfold harder after living  master hugh’s family where i had always had enough  eat    which  good i have said master thomas   mean man he  so not  give  slave enough  eat  regarded   most aggravated development  meanness even among slaveholders the rule is no matter how coarse  food only let there  enough  it this   theory    part  maryland  which i came    general practice—though there  many exceptions master thomas gave us enough  neither coarse nor fine food there  four slaves  us   kitchen—my sister eliza my aunt priscilla henny  myself  we  allowed less than  half   bushel  cornmeal per week  very little else either   shape  meat or vegetables it  not enough  us  subsist upon we  therefore reduced   wretched necessity  living   expense  our neighbors this we did  begging  stealing whichever came handy   time  need  one being considered  legitimate   other a great many times have we poor creatures been nearly perishing  hunger when food  abundance lay mouldering   safe  smokehouse  our pious mistress  aware   fact  yet  mistress  her husband would kneel every morning  pray  god would bless them  basket  store bad  all slaveholders are we seldom meet one destitute  every element  character commanding respect my master  one  this rare sort i do not know  one single noble act ever performed  him the leading trait  his character  meanness  if there  any other element  his nature   made subject  this he  mean and like most other mean men  lacked  ability  conceal his meanness captain auld  not born  slaveholder he had been  poor man master only   bay craft he came into possession  all his slaves  marriage   all men adopted slaveholders   worst he  cruel but cowardly he commanded without firmness in  enforcement  his rules    times rigid   times lax at times  spoke  his slaves   firmness  napoleon   fury   demon  other times  might well  mistaken   inquirer who had lost his way he did nothing  himself he might have passed   lion but  his ears in all things noble which  attempted his own meanness shone most conspicuous his airs words  actions   airs words  actions  born slaveholders and being assumed  awkward enough he  not even  good imitator he possessed all  disposition  deceive but wanted  power having no resources within himself   compelled    copyist  many  being such   forever  victim  inconsistency   consequence    object  contempt   held  such even  his slaves the luxury  having slaves  his own  wait upon him  something new  unprepared for he   slaveholder without  ability  hold slaves he found himself incapable  managing his slaves either  force fear or fraud we seldom called him “master” we generally called him “captain auld”   hardly disposed  title him  all i doubt not  our conduct had much  do  making him appear awkward   consequence fretful our want  reverence  him must have perplexed him greatly he wished  have us call him master but lacked  firmness necessary  command us  do so his wife used  insist upon our calling him so but  no purpose in august  my master attended  methodist campmeeting held   bayside talbot county  there experienced religion i indulged  faint hope  his conversion would lead him  emancipate his slaves  that if  did not do this  would  any rate make him more kind  humane i  disappointed  both these respects it neither made him   humane  his slaves nor  emancipate them if  had any effect  his character  made him more cruel  hateful  all his ways  i believe him  have been  much worse man after his conversion than before prior  his conversion  relied upon his own depravity  shield  sustain him  his savage barbarity but after his conversion  found religious sanction  support  his slaveholding cruelty he made  greatest pretensions  piety his house   house  prayer he prayed morning noon  night he very soon distinguished himself among his brethren   soon made  classleader  exhorter his activity  revivals  great   proved himself  instrument   hands   church  converting many souls his house   preachers’ home they used  take great pleasure  coming there  put up  while  starved us  stuffed them we have had three or four preachers there   time the names  those who used  come most frequently while i lived there  mr storks mr ewery mr humphry  mr hickey i have also seen mr george cookman  our house we slaves loved mr cookman we believed him    good man we thought him instrumental  getting mr samuel harrison  very rich slaveholder  emancipate his slaves   some means got  impression    laboring  effect  emancipation  all  slaves when    our house we  sure   called   prayers when  others  there we  sometimes called   sometimes not mr cookman took more notice  us than either   other ministers he could not come among us without betraying his sympathy  us and stupid  we were we had  sagacity  see it while i lived  my master  st michael’s there   white young man  mr wilson who proposed  keep  sabbath school   instruction  such slaves  might  disposed  learn  read  new testament we met but three times when mr west  mr fairbanks both classleaders  many others came upon us  sticks  other missiles drove us off  forbade us  meet again thus ended our little sabbath school   pious town  st michael’s i have said my master found religious sanction  his cruelty as  example i  state one  many facts going  prove  charge i have seen him tie up  lame young woman  whip her   heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders causing  warm red blood  drip and  justification   bloody deed  would quote this passage  scripture—“he  knoweth his master’s will  doeth  not shall  beaten  many stripes” master would keep this lacerated young woman tied up  this horrid situation four or five hours   time i have known him  tie her up early   morning  whip her before breakfast leave her go  his store return  dinner  whip her again cutting her   places already made raw  his cruel lash the secret  master’s cruelty toward “henny”  found   fact  her being almost helpless when quite  child she fell into  fire  burned herself horribly her hands  so burnt  she never got  use  them she could do very little but bear heavy burdens she   master  bill  expense      mean man she   constant offence  him he seemed desirous  getting  poor girl out  existence he gave her away once  his sister but being  poor gift she  not disposed  keep her finally my benevolent master  use his own words “set her adrift  take care  herself” here   recentlyconverted man holding  upon  mother    same time turning out her helpless child  starve  die master thomas  one   many pious slaveholders who hold slaves   very charitable purpose  taking care  them my master  myself had quite  number  differences he found me unsuitable  his purpose my city life  said had had  very pernicious effect upon me it had almost ruined me  every good purpose  fitted me  every thing which  bad one  my greatest faults    letting his horse run away  go down  his fatherinlaw’s farm which  about five miles  st michael’s i would then have  go after it my reason  this kind  carelessness or carefulness was  i could always get something  eat when i went there master william hamilton my master’s fatherinlaw always gave his slaves enough  eat i never left there hungry no matter how great  need  my speedy return master thomas  length said  would stand  no longer i had lived  him nine months during which time  had given me  number  severe whippings all  no good purpose he resolved  put me out   said   broken and  this purpose  let me  one year   man named edward covey mr covey   poor man  farmrenter he rented  place upon which  lived  also  hands  which  tilled it mr covey had acquired  very high reputation  breaking young slaves  this reputation   immense value  him it enabled him  get his farm tilled  much less expense  himself than  could have had  done without such  reputation some slaveholders thought  not much loss  allow mr covey  have their slaves one year   sake   training  which they  subjected without any other compensation he could hire young help  great ease  consequence  this reputation added   natural good qualities  mr covey    professor  religion—a pious soul—a member   classleader   methodist church all  this added weight  his reputation   “niggerbreaker” i  aware  all  facts having been made acquainted  them   young man who had lived there i nevertheless made  change gladly  i  sure  getting enough  eat which  not  smallest consideration   hungry man chapter x i had left master thomas’s house  went  live  mr covey   st  january  i  now   first time  my life  field hand in my new employment i found myself even more awkward than  country boy appeared     large city i had been  my new home but one week before mr covey gave me  very severe whipping cutting my back causing  blood  run  raising ridges  my flesh  large  my little finger the details  this affair   follows mr covey sent me very early   morning  one  our coldest days   month  january   woods  get  load  wood he gave me  team  unbroken oxen he told me which   inhand ox  which  offhand one he then tied  end   large rope around  horns   inhand ox  gave me  other end  it  told me if  oxen started  run  i must hold  upon  rope i had never driven oxen before   course i  very awkward i however succeeded  getting   edge   woods  little difficulty but i had got  very few rods into  woods when  oxen took fright  started full tilt carrying  cart against trees  over stumps   most frightful manner i expected every moment  my brains would  dashed out against  trees after running thus   considerable distance they finally upset  cart dashing   great force against  tree  threw themselves into  dense thicket how i escaped death i do not know there i was entirely alone   thick wood   place new  me my cart  upset  shattered my oxen  entangled among  young trees  there  none  help me after  long spell  effort i succeeded  getting my cart righted my oxen disentangled  again yoked   cart i now proceeded  my team   place where i had  day before been chopping wood  loaded my cart pretty heavily thinking  this way  tame my oxen i then proceeded  my way home i had now consumed one half   day i got out   woods safely  now felt out  danger i stopped my oxen  open  woods gate  just  i did so before i could get hold  my oxrope  oxen again started rushed through  gate catching  between  wheel   body   cart tearing   pieces  coming within  few inches  crushing me against  gatepost thus twice  one short day i escaped death   merest chance on my return i told mr covey what had happened  how  happened he ordered me  return   woods again immediately i did so   followed  after me just  i got into  woods  came up  told me  stop my cart    would teach me how  trifle away my time  break gates he then went   large gumtree   his axe cut three large switches and after trimming them up neatly  his pocketknife  ordered me  take off my clothes i made him no answer but stood  my clothes on he repeated his order i still made him no answer nor did i move  strip myself upon this  rushed  me   fierceness   tiger tore off my clothes  lashed me till  had worn out his switches cutting me so savagely   leave  marks visible   long time after this whipping   first   number just like it   similar offences i lived  mr covey one year during  first six months   year scarce  week passed without his whipping me i  seldom free   sore back my awkwardness  almost always his excuse  whipping me we  worked fully up   point  endurance long before day we  up our horses fed    first approach  day we  off   field  our hoes  ploughing teams mr covey gave us enough  eat but scarce time  eat it we  often less than five minutes taking our meals we  often   field   first approach  day till  last lingering ray had left us   savingfodder time midnight often caught us   field binding blades covey would  out  us the way  used  stand it  this he would spend  most  his afternoons  bed he would then come out fresh   evening ready  urge us   his

always aimed  taking us  surprise such  his cunning  we used  call him among ourselves “the snake” when we   work   cornfield  would sometimes crawl  his hands  knees  avoid detection  all  once  would rise nearly  our midst  scream out “ha ha come come dash on dash on” this being his mode  attack   never safe  stop  single minute his comings  like  thief   night he appeared  us  being ever

see him coiled up   corner   woodfence watching every motion   slaves he would  this purpose leave his horse tied up   woods again  would sometimes walk up  us  give us orders  though   upon  point  starting   long journey turn his back upon us  make  though   going   house  get ready and before  would get half way thither  would turn short  crawl into  fencecorner or behind some tree  there watch us till  going down   sun mr covey’s forte consisted  his power  deceive his life  devoted  planning  perpetrating  grossest deceptions every thing  possessed   shape  learning or religion  made conform  his disposition  deceive he seemed  think himself equal  deceiving  almighty he would make  short prayer   morning   long prayer  night and strange   may seem few men would  times appear more devotional than he the exercises  his family devotions  always commenced  singing and     very poor singer himself  duty  raising  hymn generally came upon me he would read his hymn  nod  me  commence i would  times do so  others i would not my noncompliance would almost always produce much confusion to show himself independent  me  would start  stagger through  his hymn   most discordant manner in this state  mind  prayed  more than ordinary spirit poor man such  his disposition  success  deceiving i do verily believe   sometimes deceived himself into  solemn belief     sincere worshipper   most high god  this too   time when  may  said  have been guilty  compelling his woman slave  commit  sin  adultery the facts   case  these mr covey   poor man   just commencing  life   only able  buy one slave and shocking    fact  bought her   said  a breeder this woman  named caroline mr covey bought her  mr thomas lowe about six miles  st michael’s she   large ablebodied woman about twenty years old she had already given birth  one child which proved her   just what  wanted after buying her  hired  married man  mr samuel harrison  live  him one year  him  used  fasten up  her every night the result was that   end   year  miserable woman gave birth  twins at this result mr covey seemed   highly pleased both   man   wretched woman such  his joy    his wife  nothing they could do  caroline during her confinement  too good or too hard   done the children  regarded  being quite  addition  his wealth if  any one time  my life more than another i  made  drink  bitterest dregs  slavery  time  during  first six months  my stay  mr covey we  worked  all weathers it  never too hot or too cold  could never rain blow hail or snow too hard  us  work   field work work work  scarcely more  order   day than   night the longest days  too short  him   shortest nights too long  him i  somewhat unmanageable when i first went there but  few months  this discipline tamed me mr covey succeeded  breaking me i  broken  body soul  spirit my natural elasticity  crushed my intellect languished  disposition  read departed  cheerful spark  lingered about my eye died  dark night  slavery closed  upon me  behold  man transformed into  brute sunday  my only leisure time i spent this   sort  beastlike stupor between sleep  wake under some large tree at times i would rise up  flash  energetic freedom would dart through my soul accompanied   faint beam  hope  flickered   moment  then vanished i sank down again mourning over my wretched condition i  sometimes prompted  take my life    covey but  prevented   combination  hope  fear my sufferings  this plantation seem now like  dream rather than  stern reality our house stood within  few rods   chesapeake bay whose broad bosom  ever white  sails  every quarter   habitable globe those beautiful vessels robed  purest white so delightful   eye  freemen   me so many shrouded ghosts  terrify  torment me  thoughts  my wretched condition i have often   deep stillness   summer’s sabbath stood all alone upon  lofty banks   noble bay  traced  saddened heart  tearful eye  countless number  sails moving off   mighty ocean the sight  these always affected me powerfully my thoughts would compel utterance  there  no audience but  almighty i would pour out my soul’s complaint  my rude way   apostrophe   moving multitude  ships— “you  loosed  your moorings   free i am fast  my chains  am  slave you move merrily before  gentle gale  i sadly before  bloody whip you  freedom’s swiftwinged angels  fly round  world i am confined  bands  iron o  i  free o  i   one  your gallant decks  under your protecting wing alas betwixt me  you  turbid waters roll go on go on o  i could also go could i but swim if i

them besides i am but  boy  all boys  bound  some one it may   my misery  slavery  only increase my happiness when i get free there   better day coming” thus i used  think  thus i used  speak  myself goaded almost  madness  one moment    next reconciling myself  my wretched lot i have already intimated  my condition  much worse during  first six months  my stay  mr covey’s than   last six the circumstances leading   change  mr covey’s course toward me form  epoch  my humble history you have seen how  man  made  slave you shall see how  slave  made  man on one   hottest days   month  august  bill smith william hughes  slave named eli  myself  engaged  fanning wheat hughes  clearing  fanned wheat  before  fan eli  turning smith  feeding  i  carrying wheat   fan the work  simple requiring strength rather than intellect yet  one entirely unused  such work  came very hard about three o’clock   day i broke down my strength failed me i  seized   violent aching   head attended  extreme dizziness i trembled  every limb finding what  coming i nerved myself up feeling  would never do  stop work i stood  long  i could stagger   hopper  grain when i could stand no longer i fell  felt  if held down   immense weight the fan  course stopped every one had his own work  do  no one could do  work   other  have his own go    same time mr covey    house about one hundred yards   treadingyard where we  fanning on hearing  fan stop  left immediately  came   spot where we were he hastily inquired what  matter was bill answered  i  sick  there  no one  bring wheat   fan i had  this time crawled away under  side   post  railfence  which  yard  enclosed hoping  find relief  getting out   sun he then asked where i was he  told  one   hands he came   spot and after looking  me awhile asked me what   matter i told him  well  i could  i scarce had strength  speak he then gave me  savage kick   side  told me  get up i tried  do so but fell back   attempt he gave me another kick  again told me  rise i again tried  succeeded  gaining my feet but stooping  get  tub  which i  feeding  fan i again staggered  fell while down  this situation mr covey took up  hickory slat  which hughes had been striking off  halfbushel measure    gave me  heavy blow upon  head making  large wound   blood ran freely   this again told me  get up i made no effort  comply having now made up my mind  let him do his worst in  short time after receiving this blow my head grew better mr covey had now left me  my fate at this moment i resolved   first time  go  my master enter  complaint  ask his protection in order  do this i must  afternoon walk seven miles  this under  circumstances  truly  severe undertaking i  exceedingly feeble made so  much   kicks  blows which i received    severe fit  sickness  which i had been subjected i however watched my chance while covey  looking   opposite direction  started  st michael’s i succeeded  getting  considerable distance  my way   woods when covey discovered me  called after me  come back threatening what  would do if i did not come i disregarded both his calls  his threats  made my way   woods  fast  my feeble state would allow  thinking i might  overhauled  him if i kept  road i walked through  woods keeping far enough   road  avoid detection  near enough  prevent losing my way i had not gone far before my little strength again failed me i could go no farther i fell down  lay   considerable time the blood  yet oozing   wound  my head for  time i thought i should bleed  death  think now  i should have done so but   blood so matted my hair   stop  wound after lying there about three quarters   hour i nerved myself up again  started  my way through bogs  briers barefooted  bareheaded tearing my feet sometimes  nearly every step  after  journey  about seven miles occupying some five hours  perform it i arrived  master’s store i then presented  appearance enough  affect any but  heart  iron from  crown  my head  my feet i  covered  blood my hair  all clotted  dust  blood my shirt  stiff  blood i suppose i looked like  man who had escaped  den  wild beasts  barely escaped them in this state i appeared before my master humbly entreating him  interpose his authority  my protection i told him all  circumstances  well  i could   seemed  i spoke  times  affect him he would then walk  floor  seek  justify covey  saying  expected i deserved it he asked me what i wanted i told him  let me get  new home   sure  i lived  mr covey again i should live  but  die  him  covey would surely kill me     fair way  it master thomas ridiculed  idea  there  any danger  mr covey’s killing me  said   knew mr covey     good man    could not think  taking me  him that should  do so  would lose  whole year’s wages  i belonged  mr covey  one year   i must go back  him come what might   i must not trouble him  any more stories or   would himself get hold  me after threatening me thus  gave me  very large dose  salts telling me  i might remain  st michael’s  night it being quite late but  i must  off back  mr covey’s early   morning   if i did not  would get hold  me which meant   would whip me i remained all night and according  his orders i started off  covey’s   morning saturday morning wearied  body  broken  spirit i got no supper  night or breakfast  morning i reached covey’s about nine o’clock  just  i  getting over  fence  divided mrs kemp’s fields  ours out ran covey  his cowskin  give me another whipping before  could reach me i succeeded  getting   cornfield    corn  very high  afforded me  means  hiding he seemed very angry  searched  me  long time my behavior  altogether unaccountable he finally gave up  chase thinking i suppose  i must come home  something  eat  would give himself no further trouble  looking  me i spent  day mostly   woods having  alternative before me—to go home   whipped  death or stay   woods   starved  death that night i fell   sandy jenkins  slave  whom i  somewhat acquainted sandy had  free wife who lived about four miles  mr covey’s   being saturday    his way  see her i told him my circumstances   very kindly invited me  go home  him i went home  him  talked this whole matter over  got his advice   what course   best  me  pursue i found sandy  old adviser he told me  great solemnity i must go back  covey but  before i went i must go  him into another part   woods where there   certain root which if i would take some    me carrying  always  my right side would render  impossible  mr covey or any other white man  whip me he said  had carried   years  since  had done so  had never received  blow  never expected  while  carried it i  first rejected  idea   simple carrying   root  my pocket would have any such effect   had said   not disposed  take it but sandy impressed  necessity  much earnestness telling me  could do no harm if  did no good to please him i  length took  root and according  his direction carried  upon my right side this  sunday morning i immediately started  home  upon entering  yard gate out came mr covey  his way  meeting he spoke  me very kindly bade me drive  pigs   lot near by  passed  towards  church now this singular conduct  mr covey really made me begin  think  there  something   root which sandy had given me  had  been  any other day than sunday i could have attributed  conduct  no other cause than  influence   root    was i  half inclined  think  root   something more than i  first had taken   be all went well till monday morning on this morning  virtue   root  fully tested long before daylight i  called  go  rub curry  feed  horses i obeyed   glad  obey but whilst thus engaged whilst   act  throwing down some blades   loft mr covey entered  stable   long rope  just  i  half out   loft  caught hold  my legs   about tying me as soon  i found what   up to i gave  sudden spring   i did so  holding  my legs i  brought sprawling   stable floor mr covey seemed now  think  had me  could do what  pleased but  this moment—from whence came  spirit i don’t know—i resolved  fight and suiting my action   resolution i seized covey hard   throat   i did so i rose he held   me  i  him my resistance  so entirely unexpected  covey seemed taken all aback he trembled like  leaf this gave me assurance  i held him uneasy causing  blood  run where i touched him   ends  my fingers mr covey soon called out  hughes  help hughes came and while covey held me attempted  tie my right hand while     act  doing so i watched my chance  gave him  heavy kick close under  ribs this kick fairly sickened hughes so   left me   hands  mr covey this kick had  effect  not only weakening hughes but covey also when  saw hughes bending over  pain his courage quailed he asked me if i meant  persist  my resistance i told him i did come what might   had used me like  brute  six months   i  determined   used so no longer with that  strove  drag me   stick   lying just out   stable door he meant  knock me down but just    leaning over  get  stick i seized him  both hands  his collar  brought him   sudden snatch   ground by this time bill came covey called upon him  assistance bill wanted  know what  could do covey said “take hold  him take hold  him” bill said his master hired him out  work  not  help  whip me so  left covey  myself  fight our own battle out we     nearly two hours covey  length let me go puffing  blowing   great rate saying  if i had not resisted  would not have whipped me half so much the truth was   had not whipped me  all i considered him  getting entirely  worst end   bargain   had drawn no blood  me but i had  him the whole six months afterwards  i spent  mr covey  never laid  weight  his finger upon me  anger he would occasionally say  didn’t want  get hold  me again “no” thought i “you need not  you  come off worse than you did before” this battle  mr covey   turningpoint  my career   slave it rekindled  few expiring embers  freedom  revived within me  sense  my own manhood it recalled  departed selfconfidence  inspired me again   determination   free the gratification afforded   triumph   full compensation  whatever else might follow even death itself he only can understand  deep satisfaction which i experienced who  himself repelled  force  bloody arm  slavery i felt  i never felt before it   glorious resurrection   tomb  slavery   heaven  freedom my longcrushed spirit rose cowardice departed bold defiance took  place  i now resolved that however long i might remain  slave  form  day had passed forever when i could   slave  fact i did not hesitate  let   known  me   white man who expected  succeed  whipping must also succeed  killing me from this time i  never again what might  called fairly whipped though i remained  slave four years afterwards i had several fights but  never whipped it    long time  matter  surprise  me why mr covey did not immediately have me taken   constable   whippingpost  there regularly whipped   crime  raising my hand against  white man  defence  myself and  only explanation i can now think  does not entirely satisfy me but such   is i  give it mr covey enjoyed  most unbounded reputation  being  firstrate overseer  negrobreaker it   considerable importance  him that reputation   stake  had  sent me—a boy about sixteen years old—to  public whippingpost his reputation would have been lost so  save his reputation  suffered me  go unpunished my term  actual service  mr edward covey ended  christmas day  the days between christmas  new year’s day  allowed  holidays and accordingly we  not required  perform any labor more than  feed  take care   stock this time we regarded  our own   grace  our masters  we therefore used or abused  nearly  we pleased those  us who had families   distance  generally allowed  spend  whole six days  their society this time however  spent  various ways the staid sober thinking  industrious ones  our number would employ themselves  making cornbrooms mats horsecollars  baskets  another class  us would spend  time  hunting opossums hares  coons but  far  larger part engaged  such sports  merriments  playing ball wrestling running footraces fiddling dancing  drinking whisky  this latter mode  spending  time   far  most agreeable   feelings  our masters a slave who would work during  holidays  considered  our masters  scarcely deserving them he  regarded  one who rejected  favor  his master it  deemed  disgrace not  get drunk  christmas    regarded  lazy indeed who had not provided himself   necessary means during  year  get whisky enough  last him through christmas from what i know   effect  these holidays upon  slave i believe them   among  most effective means   hands   slaveholder  keeping down  spirit  insurrection were  slaveholders  once  abandon this practice i have not  slightest doubt  would lead   immediate insurrection among  slaves these holidays serve  conductors or safetyvalves  carry off  rebellious spirit  enslaved humanity but  these  slave would  forced up   wildest desperation  woe betide  slaveholder  day  ventures  remove or hinder  operation  those conductors i warn him that  such  event  spirit  go forth  their midst more   dreaded than  most appalling earthquake the holidays  part  parcel   gross fraud wrong  inhumanity  slavery they  professedly  custom established   benevolence   slaveholders but i undertake  say    result  selfishness  one   grossest frauds committed upon  downtrodden slave they do not give  slaves this time because they would not like  have their work during  continuance but because they know  would  unsafe  deprive them  it this   seen   fact   slaveholders like  have their slaves spend those days just  such  manner   make them  glad  their ending   their beginning their object seems  be  disgust their slaves  freedom  plunging them into  lowest depths  dissipation for instance  slaveholders not only like  see  slave drink  his own accord but  adopt various plans  make him drunk one plan is  make bets  their slaves   who can drink  most whisky without getting drunk   this way they succeed  getting whole multitudes  drink  excess thus when  slave asks  virtuous freedom  cunning slaveholder knowing his ignorance cheats him   dose  vicious dissipation artfully labelled   name  liberty the most  us used  drink  down   result  just what might  supposed many  us  led  think  there  little  choose between liberty  slavery we felt  very properly too  we had almost  well  slaves  man   rum so when  holidays ended we staggered up   filth  our wallowing took  long breath  marched   field—feeling upon  whole rather glad  go  what our master had deceived us into  belief  freedom back   arms  slavery i have said  this mode  treatment   part   whole system  fraud  inhumanity  slavery it  so the mode here adopted  disgust  slave  freedom  allowing him  see only  abuse  it  carried out  other things for instance  slave loves molasses  steals some his master  many cases goes off  town  buys  large quantity  returns takes his whip  commands  slave  eat  molasses until  poor fellow  made sick   very mention  it the same mode  sometimes adopted  make  slaves refrain  asking  more food than their regular allowance a slave runs through his allowance  applies  more his master  enraged  him but not willing  send him off without food gives him more than  necessary  compels him  eat  within  given time then if  complains   cannot eat it   said   satisfied neither full nor fasting   whipped  being hard  please i have  abundance  such illustrations   same principle drawn  my own observation but think  cases i have cited sufficient the practice   very common one on  first  january  i left mr covey  went  live  mr william freeland who lived about three miles  st michael’s i soon found mr freeland  very different man  mr covey though not rich   what would  called  educated southern gentleman mr covey  i have shown   welltrained negrobreaker  slavedriver the former slaveholder though  was seemed  possess some regard  honor some reverence  justice  some respect  humanity the latter seemed totally insensible  all such sentiments mr freeland had many   faults peculiar  slaveholders such  being very passionate  fretful but i must do him  justice  say    exceedingly free  those degrading vices  which mr covey  constantly addicted the one  open  frank  we always knew where  find him the other   most artful deceiver  could  understood only  such   skilful enough  detect his cunninglydevised frauds another advantage i gained  my new master was  made no pretensions to or profession of religion  this  my opinion  truly  great advantage i assert most unhesitatingly   religion   south   mere covering   most horrid crimes—a justifier   most appalling barbarity—a sanctifier   most hateful frauds—and  dark shelter under which  darkest foulest grossest  most infernal deeds  slaveholders find  strongest protection were i   again reduced   chains  slavery next   enslavement i should regard being  slave   religious master  greatest calamity  could befall me for  all slaveholders  whom i have ever met religious slaveholders   worst i have ever found them  meanest  basest  most cruel  cowardly  all others it  my unhappy lot not only  belong   religious slaveholder but  live   community  such religionists very near mr freeland lived  rev daniel weeden    same neighborhood lived  rev rigby hopkins these  members  ministers   reformed methodist church mr weeden owned among others  woman slave whose name i have forgotten this woman’s back  weeks  kept literally raw made so   lash  this merciless religious wretch he used  hire hands his maxim was behave well or behave ill    duty   master occasionally  whip  slave  remind him  his master’s authority such  his theory  such his practice mr hopkins  even worse than mr weeden his chief boast  his ability  manage slaves the peculiar feature  his government    whipping slaves  advance  deserving it he always managed  have one or more  his slaves  whip every monday morning he did this  alarm their fears  strike terror into those who escaped his plan   whip   smallest offences  prevent  commission  large ones mr hopkins could always find some excuse  whipping  slave it would astonish one unaccustomed   slaveholding life  see  what wonderful ease  slaveholder can find things  which  make occasion  whip  slave a mere look word or motion—a mistake accident or want  power—are all matters  which  slave may  whipped  any time does  slave look dissatisfied it  said    devil  him   must  whipped out does  speak loudly when spoken   his master then   getting highminded  should  taken down  buttonhole lower does  forget  pull off his hat   approach   white person then   wanting  reverence  should  whipped  it does  ever venture  vindicate his conduct when censured  it then   guilty  impudence—one   greatest crimes  which  slave can  guilty does  ever venture  suggest  different mode  doing things   pointed out  his master he  indeed presumptuous  getting above himself  nothing less than  flogging  do  him does he while ploughing break  plough—or while hoeing break  hoe it  owing  his carelessness     slave must always  whipped mr hopkins could always find something  this sort  justify  use   lash   seldom failed  embrace such opportunities there  not  man   whole county  whom  slaves who had  getting their own home would not prefer  live rather than  this rev mr hopkins and yet there  not  man any where round who made higher professions  religion or  more active  revivals—more attentive   class lovefeast prayer  preaching meetings or more devotional  his family—that prayed earlier later louder  longer—than this same reverend slavedriver rigby hopkins but  return  mr freeland   my experience while  his employment he like mr covey gave us enough  eat but unlike mr covey  also gave us sufficient time  take our meals he worked us hard but always between sunrise  sunset he required  good deal  work   done but gave us good tools  which  work his farm  large but  employed hands enough  work it   ease compared  many  his neighbors my treatment while  his employment  heavenly compared  what i experienced   hands  mr edward covey mr freeland  himself  owner  but two slaves their names  henry harris  john harris the rest  his hands  hired these consisted  myself sandy jenkins  handy caldwell  this   same man who gave me  roots  prevent my being whipped  mr covey he  “a clever soul” we used frequently  talk about  fight  covey   often  we did so  would claim my success   result   roots which  gave me this superstition  very common among  more ignorant slaves a slave seldom dies but  his death  attributed  trickery henry  john  quite intelligent    very little while after i went there i succeeded  creating  them  strong desire  learn how  read this desire soon sprang up   others also they very soon mustered up some old spellingbooks  nothing would do but  i must keep  sabbath school i agreed  do so  accordingly devoted my sundays  teaching these my loved fellowslaves how  read neither  them knew his letters when i went there some   slaves   neighboring farms found what  going on  also availed themselves  this little opportunity  learn  read it  understood among all who came  there must   little display about   possible it  necessary  keep our religious masters  st michael’s unacquainted   fact that instead  spending  sabbath  wrestling boxing  drinking whisky we  trying  learn how  read    god  they had much rather see us engaged  those degrading sports than  see us behaving like intellectual moral  accountable beings my blood boils  i think   bloody manner  which messrs wright fairbanks  garrison west both classleaders  connection  many others rushed  upon us  sticks  stones  broke up our virtuous little sabbath school  st michael’s—all calling themselves christians humble followers   lord jesus christ but i am again digressing i held my sabbath school   house   free colored man whose name i deem  imprudent  mention  should   known  might embarrass him greatly though  crime  holding  school  committed ten years ago i had  one time over forty scholars  those   right sort ardently desiring  learn they   all ages though mostly men  women i look back  those sundays   amount  pleasure not   expressed they  great days  my soul the work  instructing my dear fellowslaves   sweetest engagement  which i  ever blessed we loved each other   leave them   close   sabbath   severe cross indeed when i think  these precious souls  today shut up   prisonhouse  slavery my feelings overcome me  i am almost ready  ask “does  righteous god govern  universe   what does  hold  thunders  his right hand if not  smite  oppressor  deliver  spoiled out   hand   spoiler” these dear souls came not  sabbath school because   popular  do so nor did i teach them because   reputable   thus engaged every moment they spent   school they  liable   taken up  given thirtynine lashes they came because they wished  learn their minds had been starved  their cruel masters they had been shut up  mental darkness i taught them because    delight  my soul   doing something  looked like bettering  condition  my race i kept up my school nearly  whole year i lived  mr freeland and beside my sabbath school i devoted three evenings   week during  winter  teaching  slaves  home and i have  happiness  know  several  those who came  sabbath school learned how  read   one  least  now free through my agency the year passed off smoothly it seemed only about half  long   year which preceded it i went through  without receiving  single blow i  give mr freeland  credit  being  best master i ever had till i became my own master for  ease  which i passed  year i was however somewhat indebted   society  my fellowslaves they  noble souls they not only possessed loving hearts but brave ones we  linked  interlinked  each other i loved them   love stronger than any thing i have experienced since it  sometimes said  we slaves do not love  confide  each other in answer  this assertion i can say i never loved any or confided  any people more than my fellowslaves  especially those  whom i lived  mr freeland’s i believe we would have died  each other we never undertook  do any thing  any importance without  mutual consultation we never moved separately we  one   much so  our tempers  dispositions    mutual hardships  which we  necessarily subjected  our condition  slaves at  close   year  mr freeland again hired me  my master   year  but  this time i began  want  live upon free land  well  with freeland  i  no longer content therefore  live  him or any other slaveholder i began   commencement   year  prepare myself   final struggle which should decide my fate one way or  other my tendency  upward i  fast approaching manhood  year after year had passed  i  still  slave these thoughts roused me—i must do something i therefore resolved   should not pass without witnessing  attempt  my part  secure my liberty but i  not willing  cherish this determination alone my fellowslaves  dear  me i  anxious  have them participate  me  this my lifegiving determination i therefore though  great prudence commenced early  ascertain their views  feelings  regard  their condition   imbue their minds  thoughts  freedom i bent myself  devising ways  means  our escape  meanwhile strove  all fitting occasions  impress them   gross fraud  inhumanity  slavery i went first  henry next  john then   others i found  them all warm hearts  noble spirits they  ready  hear  ready  act when  feasible plan should  proposed this  what i wanted i talked  them  our want  manhood if we submitted  our enslavement without  least one noble effort   free we met often  consulted frequently  told our hopes  fears recounted  difficulties real  imagined which we should  called   meet at times we  almost disposed  give up  try  content ourselves  our wretched lot  others we  firm  unbending  our determination  go whenever we suggested any plan there  shrinking—the odds  fearful our path  beset   greatest obstacles  if we succeeded  gaining  end  it our right   free  yet questionable—we  yet liable   returned  bondage we could see no spot this side   ocean where we could  free we knew nothing about canada our knowledge   north did not extend farther than new york   go there   forever harassed   frightful liability  being returned  slavery—with  certainty  being treated tenfold worse than before—the thought  truly  horrible one  one which   not easy  overcome the case sometimes stood thus at every gate through which we   pass we saw  watchman—at every ferry  guard—on every bridge  sentinel—and  every wood  patrol we  hemmed  upon every side here   difficulties real or imagined—the good   sought   evil   shunned on  one hand there stood slavery  stern reality glaring frightfully upon us—its robes already crimsoned   blood  millions  even now feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh on  other hand away back   dim distance under  flickering light   north star behind some craggy hill or snowcovered mountain stood  doubtful freedom—half frozen—beckoning us  come  share  hospitality this  itself  sometimes enough  stagger us but when we permitted ourselves  survey  road we  frequently appalled upon either side we saw grim death assuming  most horrid shapes now   starvation causing us  eat our own flesh—now we  contending   waves   drowned—now we  overtaken  torn  pieces   fangs   terrible bloodhound we  stung  scorpions chased  wild beasts bitten  snakes  finally after having nearly reached  desired spot—after swimming rivers encountering wild beasts sleeping   woods suffering hunger  nakedness—we  overtaken  our pursuers and  our resistance we  shot dead upon  spot i say this picture sometimes appalled us  made us “rather bear those ills we had than fly  others  we knew not of” in coming   fixed determination  run away we did more than patrick henry when  resolved upon liberty or death with us    doubtful liberty  most  almost certain death if we failed for my part i should prefer death  hopeless bondage sandy one  our number gave up  notion but still encouraged us our company then consisted  henry harris john harris henry bailey charles roberts  myself henry bailey  my uncle  belonged  my master charles married my aunt  belonged  my master’s fatherinlaw mr william hamilton the plan we finally concluded upon was  get  large canoe belonging  mr hamilton  upon  saturday night previous  easter holidays paddle directly up  chesapeake bay on our arrival   head   bay  distance  seventy or eighty miles  where we lived   our purpose  turn our canoe adrift  follow  guidance   north star till we got beyond  limits  maryland our reason  taking  water route was  we  less liable   suspected  runaways we hoped   regarded  fishermen whereas if we should take  land route we should  subjected  interruptions  almost every kind any one having  white face  being so disposed could stop us  subject us  examination the week before our intended start i wrote several protections one  each  us as well  i can remember they    following words  wit— “this   certify  i  undersigned have given  bearer my servant full liberty  go  baltimore  spend  easter holidays written  mine own hand c  “william hamilton “near st michael’s  talbot county maryland” we  not going  baltimore but  going up  bay we went toward baltimore  these protections  only intended  protect us while   bay as  time drew near  our departure our anxiety became more  more intense it  truly  matter  life  death  us the strength  our determination  about   fully tested at this time i  very active  explaining every difficulty removing every doubt dispelling every fear  inspiring all   firmness indispensable  success  our undertaking assuring them  half  gained  instant we made  move we had talked long enough we  now ready  move if not now we never should be  if we did not intend  move now we had  well fold our arms sit down  acknowledge ourselves fit only   slaves this none  us  prepared  acknowledge every man stood firm   our last meeting we pledged ourselves afresh   most solemn manner that   time appointed we would certainly start  pursuit  freedom this    middle   week   end  which we    off we went  usual  our several fields  labor but  bosoms highly agitated  thoughts  our truly hazardous undertaking we tried  conceal our feelings  much  possible  i think we succeeded very well after  painful waiting  saturday morning whose night   witness our departure came i hailed   joy bring what  sadness  might friday night   sleepless one  me i probably felt more anxious than  rest because i was  common consent   head   whole affair the responsibility  success or failure lay heavily upon me the glory   one   confusion   other  alike mine the first two hours   morning  such  i never experienced before  hope never  again early   morning we went  usual   field we  spreading manure  all  once while thus engaged i  overwhelmed   indescribable feeling   fulness  which i turned  sandy who  near by  said “we  betrayed” “well” said he “that thought  this moment struck me” we said no more i  never more certain  any thing the horn  blown  usual  we went up   field   house  breakfast i went   form more than  want  any thing  eat  morning just  i got   house  looking out   lane gate i saw four white men  two colored men the white men   horseback   colored ones  walking behind  if tied i watched them  few moments till they got up  our lane gate here they halted  tied  colored men   gatepost i  not yet certain   what  matter was in  few moments  rode mr hamilton   speed betokening great excitement he came   door  inquired if master william  in he  told     barn mr hamilton without dismounting rode up   barn  extraordinary speed in  few moments   mr freeland returned   house by this time  three constables rode up   great haste dismounted tied their horses  met master william  mr hamilton returning   barn  after talking awhile they all walked up   kitchen door there  no one   kitchen but myself  john henry  sandy  up   barn mr freeland put his head    door  called me  name saying there  some gentlemen   door who wished  see me i stepped   door  inquired what they wanted they  once seized me and without giving me any satisfaction tied me—lashing my hands closely together i insisted upon knowing what  matter was they  length said  they had learned i had been   “scrape”   i    examined before my master  if their information proved false i should not  hurt in  few moments they succeeded  tying john they then turned  henry who had  this time returned  commanded him  cross his hands “i won’t” said henry   firm tone indicating his readiness  meet  consequences  his refusal “won’t you” said tom graham  constable “no i won’t” said henry   still stronger tone with this two   constables pulled out their shining pistols  swore  their creator  they would make him cross his hands or kill him each cocked his pistol and  fingers   trigger walked up  henry saying   same time if  did not cross his hands they would blow his damned heart out “shoot me shoot me” said henry “you can’t kill me but once shoot shoot—and  damned i won’t  tied” this  said   tone  loud defiance    same time   motion  quick  lightning   one single stroke dashed  pistols   hand  each constable as  did this all hands fell upon him and after beating him some time they finally overpowered him  got him tied during  scuffle i managed i know not how  get my pass out and without being discovered put  into  fire we  all now tied  just  we   leave  easton jail betsy freeland mother  william freeland came   door  her hands full  biscuits  divided them between henry  john she then delivered herself   speech   following effect—addressing herself  me she said “you devil you yellow devil   you  put  into  heads  henry  john  run away but  you you longlegged mulatto devil henry nor john would never have thought  such  thing” i made no reply   immediately hurried off towards st michael’s just  moment previous   scuffle  henry mr hamilton suggested  propriety  making  search   protections which  had understood frederick had written  himself   rest but just   moment   about carrying his proposal into effect his aid  needed  helping  tie henry   excitement attending  scuffle caused them either  forget or  deem  unsafe under  circumstances  search so we  not yet convicted   intention  run away when we got about half way  st michael’s while  constables having us  charge  looking ahead henry inquired  me what  should do  his pass i told him  eat   his biscuit  own nothing  we passed  word around “own nothing”  “own nothing” said we all our confidence  each other  unshaken we  resolved  succeed or fail together after  calamity had befallen us  much  before we  now prepared  any thing we    dragged  morning fifteen miles behind horses  then   placed   easton jail when we reached st michael’s we underwent  sort  examination we all denied  we ever intended  run away we did this more  bring out  evidence against us than  any hope  getting clear  being sold for  i have said we  ready  that the fact was we cared but little where we went so we went together our greatest concern  about separation we dreaded  more than any thing this side  death we found  evidence against us    testimony  one person our master would not tell who  was but we came   unanimous decision among ourselves   who their informant was we  sent off   jail  easton when we got there we  delivered up   sheriff mr joseph graham   him placed  jail henry john  myself  placed  one room together—charles  henry bailey  another their object  separating us   hinder concert we had been  jail scarcely twenty minutes when  swarm  slave traders  agents  slave traders flocked into jail  look  us   ascertain if we   sale such  set  beings i never saw before i felt myself surrounded  so many fiends  perdition a band  pirates never looked more like their father  devil they laughed  grinned over us saying “ah my boys we have got you haven’t we” and after taunting us  various ways they one  one went into  examination  us  intent  ascertain our value they would impudently ask us if we would not like  have them  our masters we would make them no answer  leave them  find out  best they could then they would curse  swear  us telling us  they could take  devil out  us   very little while if we  only  their hands while  jail we found ourselves  much more comfortable quarters than we expected when we went there we did not get much  eat nor  which  very good but we had  good clean room   windows  which we could see what  going    street which  very much better than though we had been placed  one   dark damp cells upon  whole we got along very well so far   jail   keeper  concerned immediately after  holidays  over contrary  all our expectations mr hamilton  mr freeland came up  easton  took charles  two henrys  john out  jail  carried them home leaving me alone i regarded this separation   final one it caused me more pain than any thing else   whole transaction i  ready  any thing rather than separation i supposed  they had consulted together  had decided that  i   whole cause   intention   others  run away   hard  make  innocent suffer   guilty   they had therefore concluded  take  others home  sell me   warning   others  remained it  due   noble henry  say  seemed almost  reluctant  leaving  prison   leaving home  come   prison but we knew we should  all probability  separated if we  sold  since    their hands  concluded  go peaceably home i  now left  my fate i  all alone  within  walls   stone prison but  few days before  i  full  hope i expected  have been safe   land  freedom but now i  covered  gloom sunk down   utmost despair i thought  possibility  freedom  gone i  kept  this way about one week   end  which captain auld my master  my surprise  utter astonishment came up  took me out   intention  sending me   gentleman  his acquaintance into alabama but  some cause or other  did not send me  alabama but concluded  send me back  baltimore  live again  his brother hugh   learn  trade thus after  absence  three years  one month i  once more permitted  return  my old home  baltimore my master sent me away because there existed against me  very great prejudice   community   feared i might  killed in  few weeks after i went  baltimore master hugh hired me  mr william gardner  extensive shipbuilder  fell’s point i  put there  learn how  calk it however proved  very unfavorable place   accomplishment  this object mr gardner  engaged  spring  building two large manofwar brigs professedly   mexican government the vessels    launched   july   year   failure thereof mr gardner   lose  considerable sum so  when i entered all  hurry there  no time  learn any thing every man had  do  which  knew how  do in entering  shipyard my orders  mr gardner were  do whatever  carpenters commanded me  do this  placing me   beck  call  about seventyfive men i   regard all these  masters their word    my law my situation   most trying one at times i needed  dozen pair  hands i  called  dozen ways   space   single minute three or four voices would strike my ear   same moment it was—“fred come help me  cant this timber here”—“fred come carry this timber yonder”—“fred bring  roller here”—“fred go get  fresh can  water”—“fred come help saw off  end  this timber”—“fred go quick  get  crowbar”—“fred hold   end  this fall”—“fred go   blacksmith’s shop  get  new punch”—“hurra fred run  bring me  cold chisel”—“i say fred bear  hand  get up  fire  quick  lightning under  steambox”—“halloo nigger come turn this grindstone”—“come come move move  bowse this timber forward”—“i say darky blast your eyes why don’t you heat up some pitch”—“halloo halloo halloo” three voices   same time “come here—go there—hold  where you are damn you if you move i’ll knock your brains out” this  my school  eight months  i might have remained there longer but   most horrid fight i had  four   white apprentices  which my left eye  nearly knocked out  i  horribly mangled  other respects the facts   case  these until  very little while after i went there white  black shipcarpenters worked side  side  no one seemed  see any impropriety  it all hands seemed   very well satisfied many   black carpenters  freemen things seemed   going  very well all  once  white carpenters knocked off  said they would not work  free colored workmen their reason  this  alleged was  if free colored carpenters  encouraged they would soon take  trade into their own hands  poor white men would  thrown out  employment they therefore felt called upon  once  put  stop  it and taking advantage  mr gardner’s necessities they broke off swearing they would work no longer unless  would discharge his black carpenters now though this did not extend  me  form  did reach me  fact my fellowapprentices very soon began  feel  degrading  them  work  me they began  put  airs  talk about  “niggers” taking  country saying we all ought   killed and being encouraged   journeymen they commenced making my condition  hard  they could  hectoring me around  sometimes striking me i  course kept  vow i made after  fight  mr covey  struck back again regardless  consequences  while i kept them  combining i succeeded very well  i could whip  whole  them taking them separately they however  length combined  came upon me armed  sticks stones  heavy handspikes one came  front   half brick there  one  each side  me  one behind me while i  attending  those  front   either side  one behind ran up   handspike  struck me  heavy blow upon  head it stunned me i fell   this they all ran upon me  fell  beating me  their fists i let them lay    while gathering strength in  instant i gave  sudden surge  rose  my hands  knees just  i did that one  their number gave me  his heavy boot  powerful kick   left eye my eyeball seemed  have burst when they saw my eye closed  badly swollen they left me with this i seized  handspike    time pursued them but here  carpenters interfered  i thought i might  well give  up it  impossible  stand my hand against so many all this took place  sight  not less than fifty white shipcarpenters  not one interposed  friendly word but some cried “kill  damned nigger kill him kill him he struck  white person” i found my only chance  life   flight i succeeded  getting away without  additional blow  barely so   strike  white man  death  lynch law—and    law  mr gardner’s shipyard nor  there much  any other out  mr gardner’s shipyard i went directly home  told  story  my wrongs  master hugh  i am happy  say  him irreligious   was his conduct  heavenly compared    his brother thomas under similar circumstances he listened attentively  my narration   circumstances leading   savage outrage  gave many proofs  his strong indignation  it the heart  my once overkind mistress  again melted into pity my puffedout eye  bloodcovered face moved her  tears she took  chair  me washed  blood  my face and   mother’s tenderness bound up my head covering  wounded eye   lean piece  fresh beef it  almost compensation  my suffering  witness once more  manifestation  kindness  this my once affectionate old mistress master hugh  very much enraged he gave expression  his feelings  pouring out curses upon  heads  those who did  deed as soon  i got  little  better  my bruises  took me  him  esquire watson’s  bond street  see what could  done about  matter mr watson inquired who saw  assault committed master hugh told him   done  mr gardner’s shipyard  midday where there   large company  men  work “as  that”  said “the deed  done  there  no question   who did it” his answer was  could do nothing   case unless some white man would come forward  testify he could issue no warrant  my word if i had been killed   presence   thousand colored people their testimony combined would have been insufficient  have arrested one   murderers master hugh  once  compelled  say this state  things  too bad of course   impossible  get any white man  volunteer his testimony  my behalf  against  white young men even those who may have sympathized  me  not prepared  do this it required  degree  courage unknown  them  do so  just   time  slightest manifestation  humanity toward  colored person  denounced  abolitionism   name subjected  bearer  frightful liabilities the watchwords   bloodyminded   region   those days were “damn  abolitionists”  “damn  niggers” there  nothing done  probably nothing would have been done if i had been killed such was  such remains  state  things   christian city  baltimore master hugh finding  could get no redress refused  let me go back again  mr gardner he kept me himself  his wife dressed my wound till i  again restored  health he then took me into  shipyard  which   foreman   employment  mr walter price there i  immediately set  calking  very soon learned  art  using my mallet  irons in  course  one year   time i left mr gardner’s i  able  command  highest wages given   most experienced calkers i  now  some importance  my master i  bringing him  six  seven dollars per week i sometimes brought him nine dollars per week my wages   dollar   half  day after learning how  calk i sought my own employment made my own contracts  collected  money which i earned my pathway became much more smooth than before my condition  now much more comfortable when i could get no calking  do i did nothing during these leisure times those old notions about freedom would steal over me again when  mr gardner’s employment i  kept  such  perpetual whirl  excitement i could think  nothing scarcely but my life   thinking  my life i almost forgot my liberty i have observed this  my experience  slavery—that whenever my condition  improved instead   increasing my contentment  only increased my desire   free  set me  thinking  plans  gain my freedom i have found that  make  contented slave   necessary  make  thoughtless one it  necessary  darken his moral  mental vision and  far  possible  annihilate  power  reason he must  able  detect no inconsistencies  slavery  must  made  feel  slavery  right   can  brought   only when  ceases    man i  now getting  i have said one dollar  fifty cents per day i contracted  it i earned it   paid  me   rightfully my own yet upon each returning saturday night i  compelled  deliver every cent   money  master hugh and why not because  earned it—not because  had any hand  earning it—not because i owed   him—nor because  possessed  slightest shadow   right  it but solely because  had  power  compel me  give  up the right   grimvisaged pirate upon  high seas  exactly  same chapter xi i now come   part  my life during which i planned  finally succeeded  making my escape  slavery but before narrating any   peculiar circumstances i deem  proper  make known my intention not  state all  facts connected   transaction my reasons  pursuing this course may  understood   following first  i  give  minute statement  all  facts   not only possible but quite probable  others would thereby  involved   most embarrassing difficulties secondly such  statement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance   part  slaveholders than  existed heretofore among them which would  course   means  guarding  door whereby some dear brother bondman might escape his galling chains i deeply regret  necessity  impels me  suppress any thing  importance connected  my experience  slavery it would afford me great pleasure indeed  well  materially add   interest  my narrative  i  liberty  gratify  curiosity which i know exists   minds  many   accurate statement  all  facts pertaining  my most fortunate escape but i must deprive myself  this pleasure   curious   gratification which such  statement would afford i would allow myself  suffer under  greatest imputations which evilminded men might suggest rather than exculpate myself  thereby run  hazard  closing  slightest avenue  which  brother slave might clear himself   chains  fetters  slavery i have never approved   very public manner  which some  our western friends have conducted what they call  underground railroad but which i think  their open declarations  been made most emphatically  upperground railroad i honor those good men  women  their noble daring  applaud them  willingly subjecting themselves  bloody persecution  openly avowing their participation   escape  slaves i however can see very little good resulting  such  course either  themselves or  slaves escaping while upon  other hand i see  feel assured  those open declarations   positive evil   slaves remaining who  seeking  escape they do nothing towards enlightening  slave whilst they do much towards enlightening  master they stimulate him  greater watchfulness  enhance his power  capture his slave we owe something   slave south   line  well   those north  it   aiding  latter  their way  freedom we should  careful  do nothing which would  likely  hinder  former  escaping  slavery i would keep  merciless slaveholder profoundly ignorant   means  flight adopted   slave i would leave him  imagine himself surrounded  myriads  invisible tormentors ever ready  snatch  his infernal grasp his trembling prey let him  left  feel his way   dark let darkness commensurate  his crime hover over him  let him feel   every step  takes  pursuit   flying bondman   running  frightful risk  having his hot brains dashed out   invisible agency let us render  tyrant no aid let us not hold  light  which  can trace  footprints  our flying brother but enough  this i  now proceed   statement  those facts connected  my escape  which i am alone responsible   which no one can  made  suffer but myself in  early part   year  i became quite restless i could see no reason why i should   end  each week pour  reward  my toil into  purse  my master when i carried  him my weekly wages  would after counting  money look me   face   robberlike fierceness  ask “is this all” he  satisfied  nothing less than  last cent he would however when i made him six dollars sometimes give me six cents  encourage me it had  opposite effect i regarded    sort  admission  my right   whole the fact   gave me any part  my wages  proof  my mind   believed me entitled   whole  them i always felt worse  having received any thing  i feared   giving me  few cents would ease his conscience  make him feel himself    pretty honorable sort  robber my discontent grew upon me i  ever   lookout  means  escape and finding no direct means i determined  try  hire my time   view  getting money  which  make my escape in  spring   when master thomas came  baltimore  purchase his spring goods i got  opportunity  applied  him  allow me  hire my time he unhesitatingly refused my request  told me this  another stratagem  which  escape he told me i could go nowhere but   could get me  that   event  my running away  should spare no pains  his efforts  catch me he exhorted me  content myself   obedient he told me if i would  happy i must lay out no plans   future he said if i behaved myself properly  would take care  me indeed  advised me  complete thoughtlessness   future  taught me  depend solely upon him  happiness he seemed  see fully  pressing necessity  setting aside my intellectual nature  order  contentment  slavery but  spite  him  even  spite  myself i continued  think   think about  injustice  my enslavement   means  escape about two months after this i applied  master hugh   privilege  hiring my time he  not acquainted   fact  i had applied  master thomas  had been refused he too  first seemed disposed  refuse but after some reflection  granted me  privilege  proposed  following terms i    allowed all my time make all contracts  those  whom i worked  find my own employment and  return  this liberty i   pay him three dollars   end  each week find myself  calking tools   board  clothing my board  two dollars   half per week this   wear  tear  clothing  calking tools made my regular expenses about six dollars per week this amount i  compelled  make up or relinquish  privilege  hiring my time rain or shine work or no work   end  each week  money must  forthcoming or i must give up my privilege this arrangement    perceived  decidedly  my master’s favor it relieved him  all need  looking after me his money  sure he received all  benefits  slaveholding without  evils while i endured all  evils   slave  suffered all  care  anxiety   freeman i found   hard bargain but hard   was i thought  better than  old mode  getting along it   step towards freedom   allowed  bear  responsibilities   freeman  i  determined  hold  upon it i bent myself   work  making money i  ready  work  night  well  day    most untiring perseverance  industry i made enough  meet my expenses  lay up  little money every week i went  thus  may till august master hugh then refused  allow me  hire my time longer the ground  his refusal   failure  my part one saturday night  pay him  my week’s time this failure  occasioned  my attending  camp meeting about ten miles  baltimore during  week i had entered into  engagement   number  young friends  start  baltimore   camp ground early saturday evening  being detained  my employer i  unable  get down  master hugh’s without disappointing  company i knew  master hugh   no special need   money  night i therefore decided  go  camp meeting  upon my return pay him  three dollars i staid   camp meeting one day longer than i intended when i left but  soon  i returned i called upon him  pay him what  considered his due i found him very angry  could scarce restrain his wrath he said  had  great mind  give me  severe whipping he wished  know how i dared go out   city without asking his permission i told him i hired my time  while i paid him  price which  asked  it i did not know  i  bound  ask him when  where i should go this reply troubled him and after reflecting  few moments  turned  me  said i should hire my time no longer   next thing  should know of i would  running away upon  same plea  told me  bring my tools  clothing home forthwith i did so but instead  seeking work  i had been accustomed  do previously  hiring my time i spent  whole week without  performance   single stroke  work i did this  retaliation saturday night  called upon me  usual  my week’s wages i told him i had no wages i had done no work  week here we  upon  point  coming  blows he raved  swore his determination  get hold  me i did not allow myself  single word but  resolved if  laid  weight  his hand upon me  should  blow  blow he did not strike me but told me   would find me  constant employment  future i thought  matter over during  next day sunday  finally resolved upon  third day  september   day upon which i would make  second attempt  secure my freedom i now had three weeks during which  prepare  my journey early  monday morning before master hugh had time  make any engagement  me i went out  got employment  mr butler  his shipyard near  drawbridge upon what  called  city block thus making  unnecessary  him  seek employment  me at  end   week i brought him between eight  nine dollars he seemed very well pleased  asked why i did not do  same  week before he little knew what my plans were my object  working steadily   remove any suspicion  might entertain  my intent  run away   this i succeeded admirably i suppose  thought i  never better satisfied  my condition than   very time during which i  planning my escape the second week passed  again i carried him my full wages  so well pleased  he   gave me twentyfive cents quite  large sum   slaveholder  give  slave  bade me  make  good use  it i told him i would things went  without very smoothly indeed but within there  trouble it  impossible  me  describe my feelings   time  my contemplated start drew near i had  number  warmhearted friends  baltimore—friends  i loved almost  i did my life—and  thought  being separated  them forever  painful beyond expression it  my opinion  thousands would escape  slavery who now remain but   strong cords  affection  bind them  their friends the thought  leaving my friends  decidedly  most painful thought  which i had  contend the love  them  my tender point  shook my decision more than all things else besides  pain  separation  dread  apprehension   failure exceeded what i had experienced  my first attempt the appalling defeat i then sustained returned  torment me i felt assured that if i failed  this attempt my case would   hopeless one—it would seal my fate   slave forever i could not hope  get off  any thing less than  severest punishment  being placed beyond  means  escape it required no very vivid imagination  depict  most frightful scenes through which i should have  pass  case i failed the wretchedness  slavery   blessedness  freedom  perpetually before me it  life  death  me but i remained firm and according  my resolution   third day  september  i left my chains  succeeded  reaching new york without  slightest interruption  any kind how i did so—what means i adopted—what direction i travelled   what mode  conveyance—i must leave unexplained   reasons before mentioned i have been frequently asked how i felt when i found myself   free state i have never been able  answer  question  any satisfaction  myself it   moment   highest excitement i ever experienced i suppose i felt  one may imagine  unarmed mariner  feel when   rescued   friendly manofwar   pursuit   pirate in writing   dear friend immediately after my arrival  new york i said i felt like one who had escaped  den  hungry lions this state  mind however very soon subsided  i  again seized   feeling  great insecurity  loneliness i  yet liable   taken back  subjected  all  tortures  slavery this  itself  enough  damp  ardor  my enthusiasm but  loneliness overcame me there i    midst  thousands  yet  perfect stranger without home  without friends   midst  thousands  my own brethren—children   common father  yet i dared not  unfold  any one  them my sad condition i  afraid  speak  any one  fear  speaking   wrong one  thereby falling into  hands  moneyloving kidnappers whose business    lie  wait   panting fugitive   ferocious beasts   forest lie  wait  their prey the motto which i adopted when i started  slavery  this—“trust no man” i saw  every white man  enemy   almost every colored man cause  distrust it   most painful situation and  understand it one must needs experience it or imagine himself  similar circumstances let him   fugitive slave   strange land—a land given up    huntingground  slaveholders—whose inhabitants  legalized kidnappers—where   every moment subjected   terrible liability  being seized upon  his fellowmen   hideous crocodile seizes upon his prey—i say let him place himself  my situation—without home or friends—without money or credit—wanting shelter  no one  give it—wanting bread  no money  buy it—and   same time let him feel    pursued  merciless menhunters   total darkness   what  do where  go or where  stay—perfectly helpless both    means  defence  means  escape—in  midst  plenty yet suffering  terrible gnawings  hunger—in  midst  houses yet having no home—among fellowmen yet feeling  if   midst  wild beasts whose greediness  swallow up  trembling  halffamished fugitive  only equalled    which  monsters   deep swallow up  helpless fish upon which they subsist—i say let him  placed  this most trying situation—the situation  which i  placed—then  not till then   fully appreciate  hardships of  know how  sympathize with  toilworn  whipscarred fugitive slave thank heaven i remained but  short time  this distressed situation i  relieved     humane hand  mr david ruggles whose vigilance kindness  perseverance i shall never forget i am glad   opportunity  express  far  words can  love  gratitude i bear him mr ruggles  now afflicted  blindness   himself  need   same kind offices which   once so forward   performance  toward others i had been  new york but  few days when mr ruggles sought me out  very kindly took me  his boardinghouse   corner  church  lespenard streets mr ruggles  then very deeply engaged   memorable darg case  well  attending   number  other fugitive slaves devising ways  means  their successful escape and though watched  hemmed   almost every side  seemed   more than  match  his enemies very soon after i went  mr ruggles  wished  know  me where i wanted  go   deemed  unsafe  me  remain  new york i told him i   calker  should like  go where i could get work i thought  going  canada but  decided against it   favor  my going  new bedford thinking i should  able  get work there  my trade at this time anna my intended wife came on  i wrote  her immediately after my arrival  new york notwithstanding my homeless houseless  helpless condition informing her  my successful flight  wishing her  come  forthwith in  few days after her arrival mr ruggles called   rev j w c pennington who   presence  mr ruggles mrs michaels  two or three others performed  marriage ceremony  gave us  certificate  which  following   exact copy— “this may certify  i joined together  holy matrimony frederick johnson  anna murray  man  wife   presence  mr david ruggles  mrs michaels “james w c pennington “new york sept  ”  she  free  i had changed my name  frederick bailey    johnson upon receiving this certificate   fivedollar bill  mr ruggles i shouldered one part  our baggage  anna took up  other  we set out forthwith  take passage  board   steamboat john w richmond  newport  our way  new bedford mr ruggles gave me  letter   mr shaw  newport  told me  case my money did not serve me  new bedford  stop  newport  obtain further assistance but upon our arrival  newport we  so anxious  get   place  safety that notwithstanding we lacked  necessary money  pay our fare we decided  take seats   stage  promise  pay when we got  new bedford we  encouraged  do this  two excellent gentlemen residents  new bedford whose names i afterward ascertained   joseph ricketson  william c taber they seemed  once  understand our circumstances  gave us such assurance  their friendliness  put us fully  ease  their presence it  good indeed  meet  such friends  such  time upon reaching new bedford we  directed   house  mr nathan johnson  whom we  kindly received  hospitably provided for both mr  mrs johnson took  deep  lively interest  our welfare they proved themselves quite worthy   name  abolitionists when  stagedriver found us unable  pay our fare  held  upon our baggage  security   debt i had but  mention  fact  mr johnson   forthwith advanced  money we now began  feel  degree  safety   prepare ourselves   duties  responsibilities   life  freedom on  morning after our arrival  new bedford while   breakfasttable  question arose   what name i should  called by the name given me  my mother was “frederick augustus washington bailey” i however had dispensed   two middle names long before i left maryland so  i  generally known   name  “frederick bailey” i started  baltimore bearing  name  “stanley” when i got  new york i again changed my name  “frederick johnson”  thought  would   last change but when i got  new bedford i found  necessary again  change my name the reason  this necessity was  there  so many johnsons  new bedford   already quite difficult  distinguish between them i gave mr johnson  privilege  choosing me  name but told him  must not take  me  name  “frederick” i must hold   that  preserve  sense  my identity mr johnson had just been reading  “lady   lake”   once suggested  my name  “douglass” from  time until now i have been called “frederick douglass”   i am more widely known   name than  either   others i shall continue  use   my own i  quite disappointed   general appearance  things  new bedford the impression which i had received respecting  character  condition   people   north i found   singularly erroneous i had very strangely supposed while  slavery  few   comforts  scarcely any   luxuries  life  enjoyed   north compared  what  enjoyed   slaveholders   south i probably came  this conclusion   fact  northern people owned no slaves i supposed  they  about upon  level   nonslaveholding population   south i knew they  exceedingly poor  i had been accustomed  regard their poverty   necessary consequence  their being nonslaveholders i had somehow imbibed  opinion that   absence  slaves there could  no wealth  very little refinement and upon coming   north i expected  meet   rough hardhanded  uncultivated population living   most spartanlike simplicity knowing nothing   ease luxury pomp  grandeur  southern slaveholders such being my conjectures any one acquainted   appearance  new bedford may very readily infer how palpably i must have seen my mistake in  afternoon   day when i reached new bedford i visited  wharves  take  view   shipping here i found myself surrounded   strongest proofs  wealth lying   wharves  riding   stream i saw many ships   finest model   best order    largest size upon  right  left i  walled   granite warehouses   widest dimensions stowed  their utmost capacity   necessaries  comforts  life added  this almost every body seemed    work but noiselessly so compared  what i had been accustomed   baltimore there  no loud songs heard  those engaged  loading  unloading ships i heard no deep oaths or horrid curses   laborer i saw no whipping  men but all seemed  go smoothly on every man appeared  understand his work  went     sober yet cheerful earnestness which betokened  deep interest which  felt  what   doing  well   sense  his own dignity   man to me this looked exceedingly strange from  wharves i strolled around  over  town gazing  wonder  admiration   splendid churches beautiful dwellings  finelycultivated gardens evincing  amount  wealth comfort taste  refinement such  i had never seen  any part  slaveholding maryland every thing looked clean new  beautiful i saw few or no dilapidated houses  povertystricken inmates no halfnaked children  barefooted women such  i had been accustomed  see  hillsborough easton st michael’s  baltimore the people looked more able stronger healthier  happier than those  maryland i   once made glad   view  extreme wealth without being saddened  seeing extreme poverty but  most astonishing  well   most interesting thing  me   condition   colored people  great many  whom like myself had escaped thither   refuge   hunters  men i found many who had not been seven years out  their chains living  finer houses  evidently enjoying more   comforts  life than  average  slaveholders  maryland i  venture  assert  my friend mr nathan johnson of whom i can say   grateful heart “i  hungry   gave me meat i  thirsty   gave me drink i   stranger   took me in” lived   neater house dined   better table took paid for  read more newspapers better understood  moral religious  political character   nation—than nine tenths   slaveholders  talbot county maryland yet mr johnson   working man his hands  hardened  toil  not his alone but those also  mrs johnson i found  colored people much more spirited than i had supposed they would be i found among them  determination  protect each other   bloodthirsty kidnapper  all hazards soon after my arrival i  told   circumstance which illustrated their spirit a colored man   fugitive slave   unfriendly terms the former  heard  threaten  latter  informing his master  his whereabouts straightway  meeting  called among  colored people under  stereotyped notice “business  importance” the betrayer  invited  attend the people came   appointed hour  organized  meeting  appointing  very religious old gentleman  president who i believe made  prayer after which  addressed  meeting  follows “friends we have got him here  i would recommend  you young men just take him outside  door  kill him” with this  number  them bolted  him but they  intercepted  some more timid than themselves   betrayer escaped their vengeance   not been seen  new bedford since i believe there have been no more such threats  should there  hereafter i doubt not  death would   consequence i found employment  third day after my arrival  stowing  sloop   load  oil it  new dirty  hard work  me but i went     glad heart   willing hand i  now my own master it   happy moment  rapture  which can  understood only  those who have been slaves it   first work  reward  which    entirely my own there  no master hugh standing ready  moment i earned  money  rob me  it i worked  day   pleasure i had never before experienced i   work  myself  newlymarried wife it   me  startingpoint   new existence when i got through   job i went  pursuit   job  calking but such   strength  prejudice against color among  white calkers  they refused  work  me   course i could get no employment finding my trade  no immediate benefit i threw off my calking habiliments  prepared myself  do any kind  work i could get  do mr johnson kindly let me have his woodhorse  saw  i very soon found myself  plenty  work there  no work too hard—none too dirty i  ready  saw wood shovel coal carry wood sweep  chimney or roll oil casks—all  which i did  nearly three years  new bedford before i became known   antislavery world  i am told  colored persons can now get employment  calking  new bedford—a result  antislavery effort in about four months after i went  new bedford there came  young man  me  inquired if i did not wish  take  “liberator” i told him i did but just having made my escape  slavery i remarked  i  unable  pay   then i however finally became  subscriber  it the paper came  i read   week  week  such feelings   would  quite idle  me  attempt  describe the paper became my meat  my drink my soul  set all  fire its sympathy  my brethren  bonds—its scathing denunciations  slaveholders—its faithful exposures  slavery—and  powerful attacks upon  upholders   institution—sent  thrill  joy through my soul such  i had never felt before i had not long been  reader   “liberator” before i got  pretty correct idea   principles measures  spirit   antislavery reform i took right hold   cause i could do but little but what i could i did   joyful heart  never felt happier than when   antislavery meeting i seldom had much  say   meetings because what i wanted  say  said so much better  others but while attending  antislavery convention  nantucket   th  august  i felt strongly moved  speak     same time much urged  do so  mr william c coffin  gentleman who had heard me speak   colored people’s meeting  new bedford it   severe cross  i took  up reluctantly the truth was i felt myself  slave   idea  speaking  white people weighed me down i spoke but  few moments when i felt  degree  freedom  said what i desired  considerable ease from  time until now i have been engaged  pleading  cause  my brethren—with what success   what devotion i leave those acquainted  my labors  decide appendix i find since reading over  foregoing narrative  i have  several instances spoken  such  tone  manner respecting religion  may possibly lead those unacquainted  my religious views  suppose me  opponent  all religion to remove  liability  such misapprehension i deem  proper  append  following brief explanation what i have said respecting  against religion i mean strictly  apply   slaveholding religion  this land   no possible reference  christianity proper for between  christianity  this land   christianity  christ i recognize  widest possible difference—so wide   receive  one  good pure  holy   necessity  reject  other  bad corrupt  wicked to   friend   one   necessity    enemy   other i love  pure peaceable  impartial christianity  christ i therefore hate  corrupt slaveholding womenwhipping cradleplundering partial  hypocritical christianity  this land indeed i can see no reason but  most deceitful one  calling  religion  this land christianity i look upon    climax  all misnomers  boldest  all frauds   grossest  all libels never  there  clearer case  “stealing  livery   court  heaven  serve  devil in” i am filled  unutterable loathing when i contemplate  religious pomp  show together   horrible inconsistencies which every where surround me we have menstealers  ministers womenwhippers  missionaries  cradleplunderers  church members the man who wields  bloodclotted cowskin during  week fills  pulpit  sunday  claims    minister   meek  lowly jesus the man who robs me

wholesale pollution the warm defender   sacredness   family relation   same  scatters whole families—sundering husbands  wives parents  children sisters  brothers—leaving  hut vacant   hearth desolate we see  thief preaching against theft   adulterer against adultery we have men sold  build churches women sold  support  gospel  babes sold  purchase bibles   poor heathen all for the glory of god and the good of souls the slave auctioneer’s bell   churchgoing bell chime   each other   bitter cries   heartbroken slave  drowned   religious shouts  his pious master revivals  religion  revivals

men’s shoulders but they themselves  not move them  one  their fingers all their works they do    seen  men—they love  uppermost rooms  feasts   chief seats   synagogues          called  men rabbi rabbi—but woe unto you scribes  pharisees hypocrites  ye shut up  kingdom  heaven against men  ye neither go  yourselves neither suffer ye them   entering  go in ye devour widows’ houses    pretence make long prayers therefore ye shall receive  greater damnation ye compass sea  land  make one proselyte  when   made ye make him twofold more  child  hell than yourselves—woe unto you scribes  pharisees hypocrites  ye pay tithe  mint  anise  cumin  have omitted  weightier matters   law judgment mercy  faith these ought ye  have done  not  leave  other undone ye blind guides which strain

unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but  within full  dead men’s bones   all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye  full  hypocrisy  iniquity” dark  terrible   this picture i hold    strictly true   overwhelming mass  professed christians  america they strain   gnat  swallow  camel could any thing  more true  our churches they would  shocked   proposition  fellowshipping  sheepstealer    same time they hug  their communion  manstealer  brand me  being  infidel if i find fault  them  it they attend  pharisaical strictness   outward forms  religion    same time neglect  weightier matters   law judgment mercy  faith they  always ready  sacrifice but seldom  show mercy they  they who  represented  professing  love god whom they have not seen whilst they hate their brother whom they have seen they love  heathen   other side   globe they can pray  him pay money  have  bible put into his hand  missionaries  instruct him while they despise  totally neglect  heathen  their own doors such is very briefly my view   religion  this land   avoid any misunderstanding growing out   use  general terms i mean   religion  this land  which  revealed   words deeds  actions  those bodies north  south calling themselves christian churches  yet  union  slaveholders it  against religion  presented  these bodies  i have felt  my duty  testify i conclude these remarks  copying  following portrait   religion   south which is  communion  fellowship  religion   north which i soberly affirm  “true   life”  without caricature or  slightest exaggeration it  said  have been drawn several years before  present antislavery agitation began   northern methodist preacher who while residing   south had  opportunity  see slaveholding morals manners  piety  his own eyes “shall i not visit  these things saith  lord shall not my soul  avenged  such  nation  this” a parody “come saints  sinners hear me tell how pious priests whip jack  nell and women buy  children sell and preach all sinners down  hell and sing  heavenly union “they’ll bleat  baa dona like goats gorge down black sheep  strain  motes array their backs  fine black coats then seize their negroes  their throats and choke  heavenly union “they’ll church you if you sip  dram and damn you if you steal  lamb yet rob old tony doll  sam of human rights  bread  ham kidnapper’s heavenly union “they’ll loudly talk  christ’s reward and bind his image   cord and scold  swing  lash abhorred and sell their brother   lord to handcuffed heavenly union “they’ll read  sing  sacred song and make  prayer both loud  long and teach  right  do  wrong hailing  brother sister throng with words  heavenly union “we wonder how such saints can sing or praise  lord upon  wing who roar  scold  whip  sting and  their slaves  mammon cling in guilty conscience union “they’ll raise tobacco corn  rye and drive  thieve  cheat  lie and lay up treasures   sky by making switch  cowskin fly in hope  heavenly union “they’ll crack old tony   skull and preach  roar like bashan bull or braying ass  mischief full then seize old jacob   wool and pull  heavenly union “a roaring ranting sleek manthief who lived  mutton veal  beef yet never would afford relief to needy sable sons  grief was big  heavenly union “‘love not  world’  preacher said and winked his eye  shook his head he seized  tom  dick  ned cut short their meat  clothes  bread yet still loved heavenly union “another preacher whining spoke of one whose heart  sinners broke he tied old nanny   oak and drew  blood  every stroke and prayed  heavenly union “two others oped their iron jaws and waved their childrenstealing paws there sat their children  gewgaws by stinting negroes’ backs  maws they kept up heavenly union “all good  jack another takes and entertains their flirts  rakes who dress  sleek  glossy snakes and cram their mouths  sweetened cakes and this goes down  union” sincerely  earnestly hoping  this little book may do something toward throwing light   american slave system  hastening  glad day  deliverance   millions  my brethren  bonds—faithfully relying upon  power  truth love
