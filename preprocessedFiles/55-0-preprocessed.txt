around she could see nothing but  great gray prairie  every side not  tree nor  house broke  broad sweep  flat country  reached   edge   sky  all directions the sun had baked  plowed land into  gray mass  little cracks running through it even  grass  not green   sun had burned  tops   long blades until they   same gray color   seen everywhere once  house had been painted but  sun blistered  paint

dishes from  far north they heard  low wail   wind  uncle henry  dorothy could see where  long grass bowed  waves before  coming storm there now came  sharp whistling   air   south   they turned their eyes  way they saw ripples   grass coming   direction also suddenly uncle henry stood up “there’s  cyclone coming em”  called  his wife “i’ll go look after  stock” then  ran toward  sheds where  cows  horses  kept aunt em dropped her work  came   door one glance told her   danger close  hand “quick dorothy” she screamed “run   cellar” toto jumped out  dorothy’s arms  hid under  bed   girl started  get him aunt em badly frightened threw open  trap door   floor  climbed down  ladder into  small dark hole dorothy caught toto  last  started  follow her aunt when she  halfway across  room there came  great shriek   wind   house shook so hard  she lost her footing  sat down suddenly upon  floor then  strange thing happened the house whirled around two or three times  rose slowly through  air dorothy felt  if she  going up   balloon the north  south winds met where  house stood  made   exact center   cyclone in  middle   cyclone  air  generally still but  great pressure   wind  every side   house raised  up higher  higher until     very top   cyclone  there  remained   carried miles  miles away  easily  you could carry  feather it  very dark   wind howled horribly around her but dorothy found she  riding quite easily after  first few whirls around  one other time when  house tipped badly she felt  if she  being rocked gently like  baby   cradle toto did not like it he ran about  room now here now there barking loudly but dorothy sat quite still   floor  waited  see what would happen once toto got too near  open trap door  fell in   first  little girl thought she had lost him but soon she saw one  his ears sticking up through  hole   strong pressure   air  keeping him up so   could not fall she crept   hole caught toto   ear  dragged him into  room again afterward closing  trap door so  no more accidents could happen hour after hour passed away  slowly dorothy got over her fright but she felt quite lonely   wind shrieked so loudly all about her  she nearly became deaf at first she had wondered if she would  dashed  pieces when  house fell again but   hours passed  nothing terrible happened she stopped worrying  resolved  wait calmly  see what  future would bring at last she crawled over  swaying floor  her bed  lay down upon it  toto followed  lay down beside her in spite   swaying   house   wailing   wind dorothy soon closed her eyes  fell fast asleep chapter ii the council   munchkins she  awakened   shock so sudden  severe  if dorothy had not been lying   soft bed she might have been hurt as  was  jar made her catch her breath  wonder what had happened  toto put his cold little nose into her face  whined dismally dorothy sat up  noticed   house  not moving nor   dark   bright sunshine came    window flooding  little room she sprang  her bed   toto  her heels ran  opened  door the little girl gave  cry  amazement  looked about her her eyes growing bigger  bigger   wonderful sights she saw the cyclone had set  house down very gently—for  cyclone—in  midst   country  marvelous beauty there  lovely patches  greensward all about  stately trees bearing rich  luscious fruits banks  gorgeous flowers   every hand  birds  rare  brilliant plumage sang  fluttered   trees  bushes a little way off   small brook rushing  sparkling along between green banks  murmuring   voice very grateful   little girl who had lived so long   dry gray prairies while she stood looking eagerly   strange  beautiful sights she noticed coming toward her  group   queerest people she had ever seen they  not  big   grown folk she had always been used to but neither  they very small in fact they seemed about  tall  dorothy who   wellgrown child  her age although they were so far  looks go many years older three  men  one  woman  all  oddly dressed they wore round hats  rose   small point  foot above their heads  little bells around  brims  tinkled sweetly  they moved the hats   men  blue  little woman’s hat  white  she wore  white gown  hung  pleats  her shoulders over   sprinkled little stars  glistened   sun like diamonds the men  dressed  blue   same shade  their hats  wore wellpolished boots   deep roll  blue   tops the men dorothy thought  about  old  uncle henry  two  them had beards but  little woman  doubtless much older her face  covered  wrinkles her hair  nearly white  she walked rather stiffly when these people drew near  house where dorothy  standing   doorway they paused  whispered among themselves  if afraid  come farther but  little old woman walked up  dorothy made  low bow  said   sweet voice “you  welcome most noble sorceress   land   munchkins we  so grateful  you  having killed  wicked witch   east   setting our people free  bondage” dorothy listened  this speech  wonder what could  little woman possibly mean  calling her  sorceress  saying she had killed  wicked witch   east dorothy   innocent harmless little girl who had been carried   cyclone many miles  home  she had never killed anything  all her life but  little woman evidently expected her  answer so dorothy said  hesitation “you  very kind but there must  some mistake i have not killed anything” “your house did anyway” replied  little old woman   laugh “and    same thing see” she continued pointing   corner   house “there  her two feet still sticking out  under  block  wood” dorothy looked  gave  little cry  fright there indeed just under  corner   great beam  house rested on two feet  sticking out shod  silver shoes  pointed toes “oh dear oh dear” cried dorothy clasping her hands together  dismay “the house must have fallen  her whatever shall we do” “there  nothing   done” said  little woman calmly “but who  she” asked dorothy “she   wicked witch   east  i said” answered  little woman “she  held all  munchkins  bondage  many years making them slave  her night  day now they  all set free   grateful  you   favor” “who   munchkins” inquired dorothy “they   people who live  this land   east where  wicked witch ruled” “are you  munchkin” asked dorothy “no but i am their friend although i live   land   north when they saw  witch   east  dead  munchkins sent  swift messenger  me  i came  once i am  witch   north” “oh gracious” cried dorothy “are you  real witch” “yes indeed” answered  little woman “but i am  good witch   people love me i am not  powerful   wicked witch  who ruled here or i should have set  people free myself” “but i thought all witches  wicked” said  girl who  half frightened  facing  real witch “oh no    great mistake there  only four witches  all  land  oz  two  them those who live   north   south  good witches i know this  true  i am one  them myself  cannot  mistaken those who dwelt   east   west were indeed wicked witches but now  you have killed one  them there  but one wicked witch  all  land  oz—the one who lives   west” “but” said dorothy after  moment’s thought “aunt em  told me   witches  all dead—years  years ago” “who  aunt em” inquired  little old woman “she  my aunt who lives  kansas where i came from” the witch   north seemed  think   time  her head bowed  her eyes upon  ground then she looked up  said “i do not know where kansas is  i have never heard  country mentioned before but tell me    civilized country” “oh yes” replied dorothy “then  accounts  it in  civilized countries i believe there  no witches left nor wizards nor sorceresses nor magicians but you see  land  oz  never been civilized  we  cut off  all  rest   world therefore we still have witches  wizards amongst us” “who   wizards” asked dorothy “oz himself   great wizard” answered  witch sinking her voice   whisper “he  more powerful than all  rest  us together he lives   city  emeralds” dorothy  going  ask another question but just then  munchkins who had been standing silently by gave  loud shout  pointed   corner   house where  wicked witch had been lying “what  it” asked  little old woman  looked  began  laugh the feet   dead witch had disappeared entirely  nothing  left but  silver shoes “she  so old” explained  witch   north “that she dried up quickly   sun that   end  her but  silver shoes  yours  you shall have them  wear” she reached down  picked up  shoes  after shaking  dust out  them handed them  dorothy “the witch   east  proud  those silver shoes” said one   munchkins “and there  some charm connected  them but what   we never knew” dorothy carried  shoes into  house  placed them   table then she came out again   munchkins  said “i am anxious  get back  my aunt  uncle  i am sure they  worry about me can you help me find my way” the munchkins   witch first looked  one another  then  dorothy  then shook their heads “at  east not far  here” said one “there   great desert  none could live  cross it” “it   same   south” said another “for i have been there  seen it the south   country   quadlings” “i am told” said  third man “that    same   west and  country where  winkies live  ruled   wicked witch   west who would make you her slave if you passed her way” “the north  my home” said  old lady “and   edge   same great desert  surrounds this land  oz i’m afraid my dear you  have  live  us” dorothy began  sob  this  she felt lonely among all these strange people her tears seemed  grieve  kindhearted munchkins  they immediately took out their handkerchiefs  began  weep also as   little old woman she took off her cap  balanced  point   end  her nose while she counted “one two three”   solemn voice at once  cap changed   slate  which  written  big white chalk marks “let dorothy go to the city of emeralds” the little old woman took  slate  her nose  having read  words  it asked “is your name dorothy my dear” “yes” answered  child looking up  drying her tears “then you must go   city  emeralds perhaps oz  help you” “where  this city” asked dorothy “it  exactly   center   country   ruled  oz  great wizard i told you of” “is   good man” inquired  girl anxiously “he   good wizard whether    man or not i cannot tell  i have never seen him” “how can i get there” asked dorothy “you must walk it   long journey through  country   sometimes pleasant  sometimes dark  terrible however i  use all  magic arts i know   keep you  harm” “won’t you go  me” pleaded  girl who had begun  look upon  little old woman  her only friend “no i cannot do that” she replied “but i  give you my kiss  no one  dare injure  person who  been kissed   witch   north” she came close  dorothy  kissed her gently   forehead where her lips touched  girl they left  round shining mark  dorothy found out soon after “the road   city  emeralds  paved  yellow brick” said  witch “so you cannot miss it when you get  oz do not  afraid  him but tell your story  ask him  help you goodbye my dear” the three munchkins bowed low  her  wished her  pleasant journey after which they walked away through  trees the witch gave dorothy  friendly little nod whirled around  her left heel three times  straightway disappeared much   surprise  little toto who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone because  had been afraid even  growl while she stood by but dorothy knowing her    witch had expected her  disappear  just  way   not surprised   least chapter iii how dorothy saved  scarecrow when dorothy  left alone she began  feel hungry so she went   cupboard  cut herself some bread which she spread  butter she gave some  toto  taking  pail   shelf she carried  down   little brook  filled   clear sparkling water toto ran over   trees  began  bark   birds sitting there dorothy went  get him  saw such delicious fruit hanging   branches  she gathered some  it

washed herself carefully dressed herself   clean gingham  tied her pink sunbonnet  her head she took  little basket  filled   bread   cupboard laying  white cloth over  top then she looked down  her feet  noticed how old  worn her shoes were “they surely  never do   long journey toto” she said and toto looked up into her face  his little black eyes  wagged his tail  show  knew what she meant at  moment dorothy saw lying   table  silver shoes  had belonged   witch   east “i wonder if they  fit me” she said  toto “they would  just  thing  take  long walk in  they could not wear out” she took off her old leather shoes  tried   silver ones which fitted her  well  if they had been made  her finally she picked up her basket “come along toto” she said “we  go   emerald city  ask  great oz how  get back  kansas again” she closed  door locked it  put  key carefully   pocket  her dress and so  toto trotting along soberly behind her she started  her journey there  several roads nearby but  did not take her long  find  one paved  yellow bricks within  short time she  walking briskly toward  emerald city her silver shoes tinkling merrily   hard yellow roadbed the sun shone bright   birds sang sweetly  dorothy did not feel nearly so bad  you might think  little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away  her own country  set down   midst   strange land she  surprised  she walked along  see how pretty  country  about her there  neat fences   sides   road painted  dainty blue color  beyond them  fields  grain  vegetables  abundance evidently  munchkins  good farmers  able  raise large crops once   while she would pass  house   people came out  look  her  bow low  she went by  everyone knew she had been  means  destroying  wicked witch  setting them free  bondage the houses   munchkins  oddlooking dwellings  each  round   big dome   roof all  painted blue   this country   east blue   favorite color toward evening when dorothy  tired  her long walk  began  wonder where she should pass  night she came   house rather larger than  rest on  green lawn before  many men  women  dancing five little fiddlers played  loudly  possible   people  laughing  singing while  big table near   loaded  delicious fruits  nuts pies  cakes  many other good things  eat the people greeted dorothy kindly  invited her  supper   pass  night  them  this   home  one   richest munchkins   land  his friends  gathered  him  celebrate their freedom   bondage   wicked witch dorothy ate  hearty supper   waited upon   rich munchkin himself whose name  boq then she sat upon  settee  watched  people dance when boq saw her silver shoes  said “you must   great sorceress” “why” asked  girl “because you wear silver shoes  have killed  wicked witch besides you have white  your frock  only witches  sorceresses wear white” “my dress  blue  white checked” said dorothy smoothing out  wrinkles  it “it  kind  you  wear that” said boq “blue   color   munchkins  white   witch color so we know you   friendly witch” dorothy did not know what  say  this  all  people seemed  think her  witch  she knew very well she  only  ordinary little girl who had come   chance   cyclone into  strange land when she had tired watching  dancing boq led her into  house where  gave her  room   pretty bed  it the sheets  made  blue cloth  dorothy slept soundly  them till morning  toto curled up   blue rug beside her she ate  hearty breakfast  watched  wee munchkin baby who played  toto  pulled his tail  crowed  laughed   way  greatly amused dorothy toto   fine curiosity  all  people  they had never seen  dog before “how far     emerald city”  girl asked “i do not know” answered boq gravely “for i have never been there it  better  people  keep away  oz unless they have business  him but    long way   emerald city    take you many days the country here  rich  pleasant but you must pass through rough  dangerous places before you reach  end  your journey” this worried dorothy  little but she knew  only  great oz could help her get  kansas again so she bravely resolved not  turn back she bade her friends goodbye  again started along  road  yellow brick when she had gone several miles she thought she would stop  rest  so climbed   top   fence beside  road  sat down there   great cornfield beyond  fence  not far away she saw  scarecrow placed high   pole  keep  birds   ripe corn dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand  gazed thoughtfully   scarecrow its head   small sack stuffed  straw  eyes nose  mouth painted    represent  face an old pointed blue hat  had belonged  some munchkin  perched  his head   rest   figure   blue suit  clothes worn  faded which had also been stuffed  straw on  feet  some old boots  blue tops such  every man wore  this country   figure  raised above  stalks  corn  means   pole stuck up  back while dorothy  looking earnestly into  queer painted face   scarecrow she  surprised  see one   eyes slowly wink  her she thought she must have been mistaken  first  none   scarecrows  kansas ever wink but presently  figure nodded  head  her   friendly way then she climbed down   fence  walked up  it while toto ran around  pole  barked “good day” said  scarecrow   rather husky voice “did you speak” asked  girl  wonder “certainly” answered  scarecrow “how do you do” “i’m pretty well thank you” replied dorothy politely “how do you do” “i’m not feeling well” said  scarecrow   smile “for   very tedious being perched up here night  day  scare away crows” “can’t you get down” asked dorothy “no  this pole  stuck up my back if you  please take away  pole i shall  greatly obliged  you” dorothy reached up both arms  lifted  figure off  pole for being stuffed  straw   quite light “thank you very much” said  scarecrow when  had been set down   ground “i feel like  new man” dorothy  puzzled  this   sounded queer  hear  stuffed man speak   see him bow  walk along beside her “who  you” asked  scarecrow when  had stretched himself  yawned “and where  you going” “my name  dorothy” said  girl “and i am going   emerald city  ask  great oz  send me back  kansas” “where   emerald city”  inquired “and who  oz” “why don’t you know” she returned  surprise “no indeed i don’t know anything you see i am stuffed so i have no brains  all”  answered sadly “oh” said dorothy “i’m awfully sorry  you” “do you think”  asked “if i go   emerald city  you  oz would give me some brains” “i cannot tell” she returned “but you may come  me if you like if oz  not give you any brains you   no worse off than you  now” “that  true” said  scarecrow “you see”  continued confidentially “i don’t mind my legs  arms  body being stuffed because i cannot get hurt if anyone treads  my toes or sticks  pin into me  doesn’t matter  i can’t feel it but i do not want people  call me  fool  if my head stays stuffed  straw instead   brains  yours is how am i ever  know anything” “i understand how you feel” said  little girl who  truly sorry  him “if you  come  me i’ll ask oz  do all  can  you” “thank you”  answered gratefully they walked back   road dorothy helped him over  fence  they started along  path  yellow brick   emerald city toto did not like this addition   party  first he smelled around  stuffed man  if  suspected there might   nest  rats   straw   often growled   unfriendly way   scarecrow “don’t mind toto” said dorothy  her new friend “he never bites” “oh i’m not afraid” replied  scarecrow “he can’t hurt  straw do let me carry  basket  you i shall not mind it  i can’t get tired i’ll tell you  secret”  continued   walked along “there  only one thing   world i am afraid of” “what  that” asked dorothy “the munchkin farmer who made you” “no” answered  scarecrow “it’s  lighted match” chapter iv the road through  forest after  few hours  road began   rough   walking grew so difficult   scarecrow often stumbled over  yellow bricks which  here very uneven sometimes indeed they  broken or missing altogether leaving holes  toto jumped across  dorothy walked around as   scarecrow having no brains  walked straight ahead  so stepped into  holes  fell  full length   hard bricks it never hurt him however  dorothy would pick him up  set him upon his feet again while  joined her  laughing merrily  his own mishap the farms  not nearly so well cared  here  they  farther back there  fewer houses  fewer fruit trees   farther they went  more dismal  lonesome  country became at noon they sat down   roadside near  little brook  dorothy opened her basket  got out some bread she offered  piece   scarecrow but  refused “i am never hungry”  said “and    lucky thing i am not  my mouth  only painted  if i should cut  hole   so i could eat  straw i am stuffed  would come out   would spoil  shape  my head” dorothy saw  once  this  true so she only nodded  went  eating her bread “tell me something about yourself   country you came from” said  scarecrow when she had finished her dinner so she told him all about kansas  how gray everything  there  how  cyclone had carried her  this queer land  oz the scarecrow listened carefully  said “i cannot understand why you should wish  leave this beautiful country  go back   dry gray place you call kansas” “that  because you have no brains” answered  girl “no matter how dreary  gray our homes are we people  flesh  blood would rather live there than  any other country   ever so beautiful there  no place like home” the scarecrow sighed “of course i cannot understand it”  said “if your heads  stuffed  straw like mine you would probably all live   beautiful places  then kansas would have no people  all it  fortunate  kansas  you have brains” “won’t you tell me  story while we  resting” asked  child the scarecrow looked  her reproachfully  answered “my life  been so short  i really know nothing whatever i  only made day before yesterday what happened   world before  time  all unknown  me luckily when  farmer made my head one   first things  did   paint my ears so  i heard what  going on there  another munchkin  him   first thing i heard   farmer saying ‘how do you like those ears’ “‘they aren’t straight’” answered  other “‘never mind’” said  farmer “‘they  ears just  same’” which  true enough “‘now i’ll make  eyes’” said  farmer so  painted my right eye   soon    finished i found myself looking  him   everything around me   great deal  curiosity  this  my first glimpse   world “‘that’s  rather pretty eye’” remarked  munchkin who  watching  farmer “‘blue paint  just  color  eyes’ “‘i think i’ll make  other  little bigger’” said  farmer and when  second eye  done i could see much better than before then  made my nose  my mouth but i did not speak because   time i didn’t know what  mouth  for i had  fun  watching them make my body  my arms  legs  when they fastened  my head  last i felt very proud  i thought i  just  good  man  anyone “‘this fellow  scare  crows fast enough’ said  farmer ‘he looks just like  man’ “‘why    man’ said  other  i quite agreed  him the farmer carried me under his arm   cornfield  set me up   tall stick where you found me he  his friend soon after walked away  left me alone “i did not like   deserted this way so i tried  walk after them but my feet would not touch  ground  i  forced  stay   pole it   lonely life  lead  i had nothing  think of having been made such  little while before many crows  other birds flew into  cornfield but  soon  they saw me they flew away again thinking i   munchkin  this pleased me  made me feel  i  quite  important person by    old crow flew near me  after looking  me carefully  perched upon my shoulder  said “‘i wonder if  farmer thought  fool me  this clumsy manner any crow  sense could see  you  only stuffed  straw’ then  hopped down  my feet  ate all  corn  wanted the other birds seeing   not harmed  me came  eat  corn too so   short time there   great flock  them about me “i felt sad  this   showed i  not such  good scarecrow after all but  old crow comforted me saying ‘if you only had brains  your head you would   good  man  any  them   better man than some  them brains   only things worth having  this world no matter whether one   crow or  man’ “after  crows had gone i thought this over  decided i would try hard  get some brains by good luck you came along  pulled me off  stake   what you say i am sure  great oz  give me brains  soon  we get   emerald city” “i hope so” said dorothy earnestly “since you seem anxious  have them” “oh yes i am anxious” returned  scarecrow “it  such  uncomfortable feeling  know one   fool” “well” said  girl “let us go” and she handed  basket   scarecrow there  no fences  all   roadside now   land  rough  untilled toward evening they came   great forest where  trees grew so big  close together  their branches met over  road  yellow brick it  almost dark under  trees   branches shut out  daylight but  travelers did not stop  went  into  forest “if this road goes in  must come out” said  scarecrow “and   emerald city    other end   road we must go wherever  leads us” “anyone would know that” said dorothy “certainly   why i know it” returned  scarecrow “if  required brains  figure  out i never should have said it” after  hour or so  light faded away  they found themselves stumbling along   darkness dorothy could not see  all but toto could  some dogs see very well   dark   scarecrow declared  could see  well   day so she took hold  his arm  managed  get along fairly well “if you see any house or any place where we can pass  night” she said “you must tell me    very uncomfortable walking   dark” soon after  scarecrow stopped “i see  little cottage   right  us”  said “built  logs  branches shall we go there” “yes indeed” answered  child “i am all tired out” so  scarecrow led her through  trees until they reached  cottage  dorothy entered  found  bed  dried leaves  one corner she lay down  once   toto beside her soon fell into  sound sleep the scarecrow who  never tired stood up  another corner  waited patiently until morning came chapter v the rescue   tin woodman when dorothy awoke  sun  shining through  trees  toto had long been out chasing birds around him  squirrels she sat up  looked around her there   scarecrow still standing patiently  his corner waiting  her “we must go  search  water” she said  him “why do you want water”  asked “to wash my face clean after  dust   road   drink so  dry bread  not stick  my throat” “it must  inconvenient   made  flesh” said  scarecrow thoughtfully “for you must sleep  eat  drink however you have brains    worth  lot  bother   able  think properly” they left  cottage  walked through  trees until they found  little spring  clear water where dorothy drank  bathed  ate her breakfast she saw there  not much bread left   basket   girl  thankful  scarecrow did not have  eat anything  there  scarcely enough  herself  toto   day when she had finished her meal   about  go back   road  yellow brick she  startled  hear  deep groan near by “what  that” she asked timidly “i cannot imagine” replied  scarecrow “but we can go  see” just then another groan reached their ears   sound seemed  come  behind them they turned  walked through  forest  few steps when dorothy discovered something shining   ray  sunshine  fell between  trees she ran   place  then stopped short   little cry  surprise one   big trees had been partly chopped through  standing beside it   uplifted axe  his hands   man made entirely  tin his head  arms  legs  jointed upon his body but  stood perfectly motionless  if  could not stir  all dorothy looked  him  amazement  so did  scarecrow while toto barked sharply  made  snap   tin legs which hurt his teeth “did you groan” asked dorothy “yes” answered  tin man “i did i’ve been groaning  more than  year  no one  ever heard me before or come  help me” “what can i do  you” she inquired softly  she  moved   sad voice  which  man spoke “get  oilcan  oil my joints”  answered “they  rusted so badly  i cannot move them  all if i am well oiled i shall soon  all right again you  find  oilcan   shelf  my cottage” dorothy  once ran back   cottage  found  oilcan  then she returned  asked anxiously “where  your joints” “oil my neck first” replied  tin woodman so she oiled it     quite badly rusted  scarecrow took hold   tin head  moved  gently  side  side until  worked freely  then  man could turn  himself “now oil  joints  my arms”  said and dorothy oiled them   scarecrow bent them carefully until they  quite free  rust   good  new the tin woodman gave  sigh  satisfaction  lowered his axe which  leaned against  tree “this   great comfort”  said “i have been holding  axe   air ever since i rusted  i’m glad   able  put  down  last now if you  oil  joints  my legs i shall  all right once more” so they oiled his legs until  could move them freely   thanked them again  again  his release   seemed  very polite creature  very grateful “i might have stood there always if you had not come along”  said “so you have certainly saved my life how did you happen   here” “we   our way   emerald city  see  great oz” she answered “and we stopped  your cottage  pass  night” “why do you wish  see oz”  asked “i want him  send me back  kansas   scarecrow wants him  put  few brains into his head” she replied the tin woodman appeared  think deeply   moment then  said “do you suppose oz could give me  heart” “why i guess so” dorothy answered “it would   easy   give  scarecrow brains” “true”  tin woodman returned “so if you  allow me  join your party i  also go   emerald city  ask oz  help me” “come along” said  scarecrow heartily  dorothy added  she would  pleased  have his company so  tin woodman shouldered his axe  they all passed through  forest until they came   road   paved  yellow brick the tin woodman had asked dorothy  put  oilcan  her basket “for”  said “if i should get caught   rain  rust again i would need  oilcan badly” it   bit  good luck  have their new comrade join  party  soon after they had begun their journey again they came   place where  trees  branches grew so thick over  road   travelers could not pass but  tin woodman set  work  his axe  chopped so well  soon  cleared  passage   entire party dorothy  thinking so earnestly  they walked along  she did not notice when  scarecrow stumbled into  hole  rolled over   side   road indeed   obliged  call  her  help him up again “why didn’t you walk around  hole” asked  tin woodman “i don’t know enough” replied  scarecrow cheerfully “my head  stuffed  straw you know    why i am going  oz  ask him  some brains” “oh i see” said  tin woodman “but after all brains  not  best things   world” “have you any” inquired  scarecrow “no my head  quite empty” answered  woodman “but once i had brains   heart also so having tried them both i should much rather have  heart” “and why  that” asked  scarecrow “i  tell you my story  then you  know” so while they  walking through  forest  tin woodman told  following story “i  born  son   woodman who chopped down trees   forest  sold  wood   living when i grew up i too became  woodchopper  after my father died i took care  my old mother  long  she lived then i made up my mind  instead  living alone i would marry so  i might not become lonely “there  one   munchkin girls who  so beautiful  i soon grew  love her  all my heart she  her part promised  marry me  soon  i could earn enough money  build  better house  her so i set  work harder than ever but  girl lived   old woman who did not want her  marry anyone  she  so lazy she wished  girl  remain  her  do  cooking   housework so  old woman went   wicked witch   east  promised her two sheep   cow if she would prevent  marriage thereupon  wicked witch enchanted my axe  when i  chopping away  my best one day  i  anxious  get  new house  my wife  soon  possible  axe slipped all  once  cut off my left leg “this  first seemed  great misfortune  i knew  onelegged man could not do very well   woodchopper so i went   tinsmith  had him make me  new leg out  tin the leg worked very well once i  used  it but my action angered  wicked witch   east  she had promised  old woman i should not marry  pretty munchkin girl when i began chopping again my axe slipped  cut off my right leg again i went   tinsmith  again  made me  leg out  tin after this  enchanted axe cut off my arms one after  other but nothing daunted i had them replaced  tin ones the wicked witch then made  axe slip  cut off my head   first i thought    end  me but  tinsmith happened  come along   made me  new head out  tin “i thought i had beaten  wicked witch then  i worked harder than ever but i little knew how cruel my enemy could be she thought   new way  kill my love   beautiful munchkin maiden  made my axe slip again so   cut right through my body splitting me into two halves once more  tinsmith came  my help  made me  body  tin fastening my tin arms  legs  head  it  means  joints so  i could move around  well  ever but alas i had now no heart so  i lost all my love   munchkin girl  did not care whether i married her or not i suppose she  still living   old woman waiting  me  come after her “my body shone so brightly   sun  i felt very proud     did not matter now if my axe slipped   could not cut me there  only one danger—that my joints would rust but i kept  oilcan  my cottage  took care  oil myself whenever i needed it however there came  day when i forgot  do this and being caught   rainstorm before i thought   danger my joints had rusted  i  left  stand   woods until you came  help me it   terrible thing  undergo but during  year i stood there i had time  think   greatest loss i had known   loss  my heart while i   love i   happiest man  earth but no one can love who  not  heart  so i am resolved  ask oz  give me one if  does i  go back   munchkin maiden  marry her” both dorothy   scarecrow had been greatly interested   story   tin woodman  now they knew why   so anxious  get  new heart “all  same” said  scarecrow “i shall ask  brains instead   heart   fool would not know what  do   heart if  had one” “i shall take  heart” returned  tin woodman “for brains do not make one happy  happiness   best thing   world” dorothy did not say anything  she  puzzled  know which  her two friends  right  she decided if she could only get back  kansas  aunt em  did not matter so much whether  woodman had no brains   scarecrow no heart or each got what  wanted what worried her most    bread  nearly gone  another meal  herself  toto would empty  basket to  sure neither  woodman nor  scarecrow ever ate anything but she  not made  tin nor straw  could not live unless she  fed chapter vi the cowardly lion all this time dorothy  her companions had been walking through  thick woods the road  still paved  yellow brick but these  much covered  dried branches  dead leaves   trees   walking  not  all good there  few birds  this part   forest  birds love  open country where there  plenty  sunshine but now  then there came  deep growl  some wild animal hidden among  trees these sounds made  little girl’s heart beat fast  she did not know what made them but toto knew   walked close  dorothy’s side  did not even bark  return “how long   be”  child asked   tin woodman “before we  out   forest” “i cannot tell”   answer “for i have never been   emerald city but my father went there once when i   boy   said    long journey through  dangerous country although nearer   city where oz dwells  country  beautiful but i am not afraid so long  i have my oilcan  nothing can hurt  scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead  mark   good witch’s kiss    protect you  harm” “but toto” said  girl anxiously “what  protect him” “we must protect him ourselves if    danger” replied  tin woodman just   spoke there came   forest  terrible roar   next moment  great lion bounded into  road with one blow  his paw  sent  scarecrow spinning over  over   edge   road  then  struck   tin woodman  his sharp claws but   lion’s surprise  could make no impression   tin although  woodman fell over   road  lay still little toto now   had  enemy  face ran barking toward  lion   great beast had opened his mouth  bite  dog when dorothy fearing toto would  killed  heedless  danger rushed forward  slapped  lion upon his nose  hard  she could while she cried out “don’t you dare  bite toto you ought   ashamed  yourself  big beast like you  bite  poor little dog” “i didn’t bite him” said  lion   rubbed his nose  his paw where dorothy had hit it “no but you tried to” she retorted “you  nothing but  big coward” “i know it” said  lion hanging his head  shame “i’ve always known it but how can i help it” “i don’t know i’m sure to think  your striking  stuffed man like  poor scarecrow” “is  stuffed” asked  lion  surprise   watched her pick up  scarecrow  set him upon his feet while she patted him into shape again “of course he’s stuffed” replied dorothy who  still angry “that’s why  went over so easily” remarked  lion “it astonished me  see him whirl around so is  other one stuffed also” “no” said dorothy “he’s made  tin” and she helped  woodman up again “that’s why  nearly blunted my claws” said  lion “when they scratched against  tin  made  cold shiver run down my back what   little animal you  so tender of” “he  my dog toto” answered dorothy “is  made  tin or stuffed” asked  lion “neither he’s a—a—a meat dog” said  girl “oh he’s  curious animal  seems remarkably small now  i look  him no one would think  biting such  little thing except  coward like me” continued  lion sadly “what makes you  coward” asked dorothy looking   great beast  wonder     big   small horse “it’s  mystery” replied  lion “i suppose i  born  way all  other animals   forest naturally expect me   brave   lion  everywhere thought    king  beasts i learned  if i roared very loudly every living thing  frightened  got out  my way whenever i’ve met  man i’ve been awfully scared but i just roared  him    always run away  fast   could go if  elephants   tigers   bears had ever tried  fight me i should have run myself—i’m such  coward but just  soon  they hear me roar they all try  get away  me   course i let them go” “but  isn’t right the king  beasts shouldn’t   coward” said  scarecrow “i know it” returned  lion wiping  tear  his eye   tip  his tail “it  my great sorrow  makes my life very unhappy but whenever there  danger my heart begins  beat fast” “perhaps you have heart disease” said  tin woodman “it may be” said  lion “if you have” continued  tin woodman “you ought   glad   proves you have  heart for my part i have no heart so i cannot have heart disease” “perhaps” said  lion thoughtfully “if i had no heart i should not   coward” “have you brains” asked  scarecrow “i suppose so i’ve never looked  see” replied  lion “i am going   great oz  ask him  give me some” remarked  scarecrow “for my head  stuffed  straw” “and i am going  ask him  give me  heart” said  woodman “and i am going  ask him  send toto  me back  kansas” added dorothy “do you think oz could give me courage” asked  cowardly lion “just  easily   could give me brains” said  scarecrow “or give me  heart” said  tin woodman “or send me back  kansas” said dorothy “then if you don’t mind i’ll go  you” said  lion “for my life  simply unbearable without  bit  courage” “you   very welcome” answered dorothy “for you  help  keep away  other wild beasts it seems  me they must  more cowardly than you  if they allow you  scare them so easily” “they really are” said  lion “but  doesn’t make me any braver   long  i know myself    coward i shall  unhappy” so once more  little company set off upon  journey  lion walking  stately strides  dorothy’s side toto did not approve  this new comrade  first   could not forget how nearly  had been crushed between  lion’s great jaws but after  time  became more  ease  presently toto   cowardly lion had grown   good friends during  rest   day there  no other adventure  mar  peace  their journey once indeed  tin woodman stepped upon  beetle   crawling along  road  killed  poor little thing this made  tin woodman very unhappy    always careful not  hurt any living creature    walked along  wept several tears  sorrow  regret these tears ran slowly down his face  over  hinges  his jaw  there they rusted when dorothy presently asked him  question  tin woodman could not open his mouth  his jaws  tightly rusted together he became greatly frightened  this  made many motions  dorothy  relieve him but she could not understand the lion  also puzzled  know what  wrong but  scarecrow seized  oilcan  dorothy’s basket  oiled  woodman’s jaws so  after  few moments  could talk  well  before “this  serve me  lesson” said he “to look where i step for if i should kill another bug or beetle i should surely cry again  crying rusts my jaws so  i cannot speak” thereafter  walked very carefully  his eyes   road  when  saw  tiny ant toiling   would step over it so  not  harm it the tin woodman knew very well  had no heart  therefore  took great care never   cruel or unkind  anything “you people  hearts”  said “have something  guide you  need never do wrong but i have no heart  so i must  very careful when oz gives me  heart  course i needn’t mind so much” chapter vii the journey   great oz they  obliged  camp out  night under  large tree   forest  there  no houses near the tree made  good thick covering  protect them   dew   tin woodman chopped  great pile  wood  his axe  dorothy built  splendid fire  warmed her  made her feel less lonely she  toto ate  last  their bread  now she did not know what they would do  breakfast “if you wish” said  lion “i  go into  forest  kill  deer  you you can roast    fire since your tastes  so peculiar  you prefer cooked food  then you  have  very good breakfast” “don’t please don’t” begged  tin woodman “i should certainly weep if you killed  poor deer  then my jaws would rust again” but  lion went away into  forest  found his own supper  no one ever knew what  was   didn’t mention it and  scarecrow found  tree full  nuts  filled dorothy’s basket  them so  she would not  hungry   long time she thought this  very kind  thoughtful   scarecrow but she laughed heartily   awkward way  which  poor creature picked up  nuts his padded hands  so clumsy   nuts  so small   dropped almost  many   put   basket but  scarecrow did not mind how long  took him  fill  basket   enabled him  keep away   fire   feared  spark might get into his straw  burn him up so  kept  good distance away   flames  only came near  cover dorothy  dry leaves when she lay down  sleep these kept her very snug  warm  she slept soundly until morning when   daylight  girl bathed her face   little rippling brook  soon after they all started toward  emerald city this     eventful day   travelers they had hardly been walking  hour when they saw before them  great ditch  crossed  road  divided  forest  far  they could see  either side it   very wide ditch  when they crept up   edge  looked into  they could see   also very deep  there  many big jagged rocks   bottom the sides  so steep  none  them could climb down    moment  seemed  their journey must end “what shall we do” asked dorothy despairingly “i haven’t  faintest idea” said  tin woodman   lion shook his shaggy mane  looked thoughtful but  scarecrow said “we cannot fly   certain neither can we climb down into this great ditch therefore if we cannot jump over it we must stop where we are” “i think i could jump over it” said  cowardly lion after measuring  distance carefully  his mind “then we  all right” answered  scarecrow “for you can carry us all over  your back one   time” “well i’ll try it” said  lion “who  go first” “i will” declared  scarecrow “for if you found  you could not jump over  gulf dorothy would  killed or  tin woodman badly dented   rocks below but if i am  your back   not matter so much   fall would not hurt me  all” “i am terribly afraid  falling myself” said  cowardly lion “but i suppose there  nothing  do but try it so get  my back  we  make  attempt” the scarecrow sat upon  lion’s back   big beast walked   edge   gulf  crouched down “why don’t you run  jump” asked  scarecrow “because  isn’t  way we lions do these things”  replied then giving  great spring  shot through  air  landed safely   other side they  all greatly pleased  see how easily  did it  after  scarecrow had got down  his back  lion sprang across  ditch again dorothy thought she would go next so she took toto  her arms  climbed   lion’s back holding tightly  his mane  one hand the next moment  seemed  if she  flying through  air  then before she had time  think about it she  safe   other side the lion went back  third time  got  tin woodman  then they all sat down   few moments  give  beast  chance  rest  his great leaps had made his breath short   panted like  big dog   been running too long they found  forest very thick  this side   looked dark  gloomy after  lion had rested they started along  road  yellow brick silently wondering each  his own mind if ever they would come   end   woods  reach  bright sunshine again to add  their discomfort they soon heard strange noises   depths   forest   lion whispered  them     this part   country   kalidahs lived “what   kalidahs” asked  girl “they  monstrous beasts  bodies like bears  heads like tigers” replied  lion “and  claws so long  sharp  they could tear me  two  easily  i could kill toto i’m terribly afraid   kalidahs” “i’m not surprised  you are” returned dorothy “they must  dreadful beasts” the lion  about  reply when suddenly they came  another gulf across  road but this one  so broad  deep   lion knew  once  could not leap across it so they sat down  consider what they should do  after serious thought  scarecrow said “here   great tree standing close   ditch if  tin woodman can chop  down so    fall   other side we can walk across  easily” “that   firstrate idea” said  lion “one would almost suspect you had brains  your head instead  straw” the woodman set  work  once  so sharp  his axe   tree  soon chopped nearly through then  lion put his strong front legs against  tree  pushed  all his might  slowly  big tree tipped  fell   crash across  ditch   top branches   other side they had just started  cross this queer bridge when  sharp growl made them all look up   their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts  bodies like bears  heads like tigers “they   kalidahs” said  cowardly lion beginning  tremble “quick” cried  scarecrow “let us cross over” so dorothy went first holding toto  her arms  tin woodman followed   scarecrow came next the lion although   certainly afraid turned  face  kalidahs  then  gave so loud  terrible  roar  dorothy screamed   scarecrow fell over backward while even  fierce beasts stopped short  looked  him  surprise but seeing they  bigger than  lion  remembering  there  two  them  only one  him  kalidahs again rushed forward   lion crossed over  tree  turned  see what they would do next without stopping  instant  fierce beasts also began  cross  tree and  lion said  dorothy “we  lost  they  surely tear us  pieces  their sharp claws but stand close behind me  i  fight them  long  i am alive” “wait  minute” called  scarecrow he had been thinking what  best   done  now  asked  woodman  chop away  end   tree  rested  their side   ditch the tin woodman began  use his axe  once and just   two kalidahs  nearly across  tree fell   crash into  gulf carrying  ugly snarling brutes  it  both  dashed  pieces   sharp rocks   bottom “well” said  cowardly lion drawing  long breath  relief “i see we  going  live  little while longer  i am glad  it   must   very uncomfortable thing not   alive those creatures frightened me so badly  my heart  beating yet” “ah” said  tin woodman sadly “i wish i had  heart  beat” this adventure made  travelers more anxious than ever  get out   forest  they walked so fast  dorothy became tired  had  ride   lion’s back to their great joy  trees became thinner  farther they advanced    afternoon they suddenly came upon  broad river flowing swiftly just before them on  other side   water they could see  road  yellow brick running through  beautiful country  green meadows dotted  bright flowers  all  road bordered  trees hanging full  delicious fruits they  greatly pleased  see this delightful country before them “how shall we cross  river” asked dorothy “that  easily done” replied  scarecrow “the tin woodman must build us  raft so we can float   other side” so  woodman took his axe  began  chop down small trees  make  raft  while   busy  this  scarecrow found   riverbank  tree full  fine fruit this pleased dorothy who had eaten nothing but nuts all day  she made  hearty meal   ripe fruit but  takes time  make  raft even when one   industrious  untiring   tin woodman  when night came  work  not done so they found  cozy place under  trees where they slept well until  morning  dorothy dreamed   emerald city    good wizard oz who would soon send her back  her own home again chapter viii the deadly poppy field our little party  travelers awakened  next morning refreshed  full  hope  dorothy breakfasted like  princess off peaches  plums   trees beside  river behind them   dark forest they had passed safely through although they had suffered many discouragements but before them   lovely sunny country  seemed  beckon them    emerald city to  sure  broad river now cut them off  this beautiful land but  raft  nearly done  after  tin woodman had cut  few more logs  fastened them together  wooden pins they  ready  start dorothy sat down   middle   raft  held toto  her arms when  cowardly lion stepped upon  raft  tipped badly    big  heavy but  scarecrow   tin woodman stood upon  other end  steady it  they had long poles  their hands  push  raft through  water they got along quite well  first but when they reached  middle   river  swift current swept  raft downstream farther  farther away   road  yellow brick and  water grew so deep   long poles would not touch  bottom “this  bad” said  tin woodman “for if we cannot get   land we shall  carried into  country   wicked witch   west  she  enchant us  make us her slaves” “and then i should get no brains” said  scarecrow “and i should get no courage” said  cowardly lion “and i should get no heart” said  tin woodman “and i should never get back  kansas” said dorothy “we must certainly get   emerald city if we can”  scarecrow continued   pushed so hard  his long pole   stuck fast   mud   bottom   river then before  could pull  out again—or let go—the raft  swept away   poor scarecrow  left clinging   pole   middle   river “goodbye”  called after them  they  very sorry  leave him indeed  tin woodman began  cry but fortunately remembered   might rust  so dried his tears  dorothy’s apron of course this   bad thing   scarecrow “i am now worse off than when i first met dorothy”  thought “then i  stuck   pole   cornfield where i could makebelieve scare  crows  any rate but surely there  no use   scarecrow stuck   pole   middle   river i am afraid i shall never have any brains after all” down  stream  raft floated   poor scarecrow  left far behind then  lion said “something must  done  save us i think i can swim   shore  pull  raft after me if you  only hold fast   tip  my tail” so  sprang into  water   tin woodman caught fast hold  his tail then  lion began  swim  all his might toward  shore it  hard work although   so big but    they  drawn out   current  then dorothy took  tin woodman’s long pole  helped push  raft   land they  all tired out when they reached  shore  last  stepped off upon  pretty green grass  they also knew   stream had carried them  long way past  road  yellow brick  led   emerald city “what shall we do now” asked  tin woodman   lion lay down   grass  let  sun dry him “we must get back   road  some way” said dorothy “the best plan    walk along  riverbank until we come   road again” remarked  lion so when they  rested dorothy picked up her basket  they started along  grassy bank   road  which  river had carried them it   lovely country  plenty  flowers  fruit trees  sunshine  cheer them  had they not felt so sorry   poor scarecrow they could have been very happy they walked along  fast  they could dorothy only stopping once  pick  beautiful flower  after  time  tin woodman cried out “look” then they all looked   river  saw  scarecrow perched upon his pole   middle   water looking very lonely  sad “what can we do  save him” asked dorothy the lion   woodman both shook their heads  they did not know so they sat down upon  bank  gazed wistfully   scarecrow until  stork flew by who upon seeing them stopped  rest   water’s edge “who  you  where  you going” asked  stork “i am dorothy” answered  girl “and these  my friends  tin woodman   cowardly lion  we  going   emerald city” “this isn’t  road” said  stork  she twisted her long neck  looked sharply   queer party “i know it” returned dorothy “but we have lost  scarecrow   wondering how we shall get him again” “where  he” asked  stork “over there   river” answered  little girl “if  wasn’t so big  heavy i would get him  you” remarked  stork “he isn’t heavy  bit” said dorothy eagerly “for   stuffed  straw  if you  bring him back  us we shall thank you ever  ever so much” “well i’ll try” said  stork “but if i find   too heavy  carry i shall have  drop him   river again” so  big bird flew into  air  over  water till she came  where  scarecrow  perched upon his pole then  stork  her great claws grabbed  scarecrow   arm  carried him up into  air  back   bank where dorothy   lion   tin woodman  toto  sitting when  scarecrow found himself among his friends again   so happy   hugged them all even  lion  toto   they walked along  sang “tolderideoh”  every step  felt so gay “i  afraid i should have  stay   river forever”  said “but  kind stork saved me  if i ever get any brains i shall find  stork again  do her some kindness  return” “that’s all right” said  stork who  flying along beside them “i always like  help anyone  trouble but i must go now  my babies  waiting   nest  me i hope you  find  emerald city   oz  help you” “thank you” replied dorothy  then  kind stork flew into  air   soon out  sight they walked along listening   singing   brightly colored birds  looking   lovely flowers which now became so thick   ground  carpeted  them there  big yellow  white  blue  purple blossoms besides great clusters  scarlet poppies which  so brilliant  color they almost dazzled dorothy’s eyes “aren’t they beautiful”  girl asked  she breathed   spicy scent   bright flowers “i suppose so” answered  scarecrow “when i have brains i shall probably like them better” “if i only had  heart i should love them” added  tin woodman “i always did like flowers” said  lion “they seem so helpless  frail but there  none   forest so bright  these” they now came upon more  more   big scarlet poppies  fewer  fewer   other flowers  soon they found themselves   midst   great meadow  poppies now   well known  when there  many  these flowers together their odor  so powerful  anyone who breathes  falls asleep  if  sleeper  not carried away   scent   flowers  sleeps    forever but dorothy did not know this nor could she get away   bright red flowers   everywhere about so presently her eyes grew heavy  she felt she must sit down  rest   sleep but  tin woodman would not let her do this “we must hurry  get back   road  yellow brick before dark”  said   scarecrow agreed  him so they kept walking until dorothy could stand no longer her eyes closed  spite  herself  she forgot where she   fell among  poppies fast asleep “what shall we do” asked  tin woodman “if we leave her here she  die” said  lion “the smell   flowers  killing us all i myself can scarcely keep my eyes open   dog  asleep already” it  true toto had fallen down beside his little mistress but  scarecrow   tin woodman not being made  flesh  not troubled   scent   flowers “run fast” said  scarecrow   lion “and get out  this deadly flower bed  soon  you can we  bring  little girl  us but if you should fall asleep you  too big   carried” so  lion aroused himself  bounded forward  fast   could go in  moment   out  sight “let us

spoke “is there anything we can do”  asked “to repay you  saving  life  our queen” “nothing  i know of” answered  woodman but  scarecrow who had been trying  think but could not because his head  stuffed  straw said quickly “oh yes you can save our friend  cowardly lion who  asleep   poppy bed” “a lion” cried  little queen “why  would eat us all up” “oh no” declared  scarecrow “this lion   coward” “really” asked  mouse “he says so himself” answered  scarecrow “and  would never hurt anyone who  our friend if you  help us  save him i promise   shall treat you all  kindness” “very well” said  queen “we trust you but what shall we do” “are there many  these mice which call you queen   willing  obey you” “oh yes there  thousands” she replied “then send  them all  come here  soon

possible “now” said  scarecrow   tin woodman “you must go  those trees   riverside  make  truck   carry  lion” so  woodman went  once   trees  began  work   soon made  truck out   limbs  trees  which  chopped away all  leaves  branches he fastened  together  wooden pegs  made  four wheels out  short pieces   big tree trunk so fast  so well did  work    time  mice began  arrive  truck  all ready

“permit me  introduce  you her majesty  queen” dorothy nodded gravely   queen made  curtsy after which she became quite friendly   little girl the scarecrow   woodman now began  fasten  mice   truck using  strings they had brought one end   string  tied around  neck  each mouse   other end   truck of course  truck   thousand times bigger than any   mice who   draw it but when all  mice had been harnessed they  able  pull  quite easily even  scarecrow   tin woodman could sit  it   drawn swiftly  their queer little horses   place where  lion lay asleep after  great deal  hard work   lion  heavy they managed  get him up   truck then  queen hurriedly gave her people  order  start  she feared if  mice stayed among  poppies too long they also would fall asleep at first  little creatures many though they were could hardly stir  heavily loaded truck but  woodman   scarecrow both pushed  behind  they got along better soon they rolled  lion out   poppy bed   green fields where  could breathe  sweet fresh air again instead   poisonous scent   flowers dorothy came  meet them  thanked  little mice warmly  saving her companion  death she had grown so fond   big lion she  glad  had been rescued then  mice  unharnessed   truck  scampered away through  grass  their homes the queen   mice   last  leave “if ever you need us again” she said “come out into  field  call  we shall hear you  come  your assistance goodbye” “goodbye” they all answered  away  queen ran while dorothy held toto tightly lest  should run after her  frighten her after this they sat down beside  lion until  should awaken   scarecrow brought dorothy some fruit   tree near by which she ate  her dinner chapter x the guardian   gate it  some time before  cowardly lion awakened   had lain among  poppies  long while breathing  their deadly fragrance but when  did open his eyes  roll off  truck   very glad  find himself still alive “i ran  fast  i could”  said sitting down  yawning “but  flowers  too strong  me how did you get me out” then they told him   field mice  how they had generously saved him  death   cowardly lion laughed  said “i have always thought myself very big  terrible yet such little things  flowers came near  killing me  such small animals  mice have saved my life how strange  all is but comrades what shall we do now” “we must journey  until we find  road  yellow brick again” said dorothy “and then we can keep    emerald city” so  lion being fully refreshed  feeling quite himself again they all started upon  journey greatly enjoying  walk through  soft fresh grass    not long before they reached  road  yellow brick  turned again toward  emerald city where  great oz dwelt the road  smooth  well paved now   country about  beautiful so   travelers rejoiced  leaving  forest far behind     many dangers they had met   gloomy shades once more they could see fences built beside  road but these  painted green  when they came   small house  which  farmer evidently lived  also  painted green they passed  several  these houses during  afternoon  sometimes people came   doors  looked  them  if they would like  ask questions but no one came near them nor spoke  them because   great lion  which they  very much afraid the people  all dressed  clothing   lovely emeraldgreen color  wore peaked hats like those   munchkins “this must   land  oz” said dorothy “and we  surely getting near  emerald city” “yes” answered  scarecrow “everything  green here while   country   munchkins blue   favorite color but  people do not seem    friendly   munchkins  i’m afraid we shall  unable  find  place  pass  night” “i should like something  eat besides fruit” said  girl “and i’m sure toto  nearly starved let us stop   next house  talk   people” so when they came   goodsized farmhouse dorothy walked boldly up   door  knocked a woman opened  just far enough  look out  said “what do you want child  why   great lion  you” “we wish  pass  night  you if you  allow us” answered dorothy “and  lion  my friend  comrade  would not hurt you   world” “is  tame” asked  woman opening  door  little wider “oh yes” said  girl “and    great coward too he   more afraid  you than you   him” “well” said  woman after thinking  over  taking another peep   lion “if    case you may come in  i  give you some supper   place  sleep” so they all entered  house where there were besides  woman two children   man the man had hurt his leg   lying   couch   corner they seemed greatly surprised  see so strange  company  while  woman  busy laying  table  man asked “where  you all going” “to  emerald city” said dorothy “to see  great oz” “oh indeed” exclaimed  man “are you sure  oz  see you” “why not” she replied “why   said   never lets anyone come into his presence i have been   emerald city many times     beautiful  wonderful place but i have never been permitted  see  great oz nor do i know  any living person who  seen him” “does  never go out” asked  scarecrow “never he sits day after day   great throne room  his palace  even those who wait upon him do not see him face  face” “what   like” asked  girl “that  hard  tell” said  man thoughtfully “you see oz   great wizard  can take  any form  wishes so  some say  looks like  bird  some say  looks like  elephant  some say  looks like  cat to others  appears   beautiful fairy or  brownie or  any other form  pleases him but who  real oz is when    his own form no living person can tell” “that  very strange” said dorothy “but we must try  some way  see him or we shall have made our journey  nothing” “why do you wish  see  terrible oz” asked  man “i want him  give me some brains” said  scarecrow eagerly “oh oz could do  easily enough” declared  man “he  more brains than  needs” “and i want him  give me  heart” said  tin woodman “that  not trouble him” continued  man “for oz   large collection  hearts  all sizes  shapes” “and i want him  give me courage” said  cowardly lion “oz keeps  great pot  courage  his throne room” said  man “which   covered   golden plate  keep   running over he   glad  give you some” “and i want him  send me back  kansas” said dorothy “where  kansas” asked  man  surprise “i don’t know” replied dorothy sorrowfully “but   my home  i’m sure it’s somewhere” “very likely well oz can do anything so i suppose   find kansas  you but first you must get  see him      hard task   great wizard does not like  see anyone   usually  his own way but what do you want”  continued speaking  toto toto only wagged his tail for strange  say  could not speak the woman now called  them  supper  ready so they gathered around  table  dorothy ate some delicious porridge   dish  scrambled eggs   plate  nice white bread  enjoyed her meal the lion ate some   porridge but did not care  it saying   made  oats  oats  food  horses not  lions the scarecrow   tin woodman ate nothing  all toto ate  little  everything   glad  get  good supper again the woman now gave dorothy  bed

terrible  if you come   idle or foolish errand  bother  wise reflections   great wizard  might  angry  destroy you all   instant” “but   not  foolish errand nor  idle one” replied  scarecrow “it  important and we have been told  oz   good wizard” “so  is” said  green man “and  rules  emerald city wisely  well but  those who  not honest or who approach him  curiosity   most terrible  few have ever dared ask  see his face i am  guardian   gates  since you demand  see  great oz i must take you  his palace but first you must put   spectacles” “why” asked dorothy “because if you did not wear

dressed   green uniform  wearing  long green beard “here  strangers” said  guardian   gates  him “and they demand  see  great oz” “step inside” answered  soldier “and i  carry your message  him” so they passed through  palace gates   led into  big room   green carpet  lovely green furniture set  emeralds the soldier made them all wipe their feet upon  green mat before entering this room  when they  seated  said politely “please make yourselves comfortable while i go   door   throne room  tell oz you  here” they had  wait  long time before  soldier returned when  last  came back dorothy asked “have you seen oz” “oh no” returned  soldier “i have never seen him but i spoke  him   sat behind his screen  gave him your message he said   grant you  audience if you so desire but each one  you must enter his presence alone    admit but one each day therefore  you must remain   palace  several days i  have you shown  rooms where you may rest  comfort after your journey” “thank you” replied  girl “that  very kind  oz” the soldier now blew upon  green whistle   once  young girl dressed   pretty green silk gown entered  room she had lovely green hair  green eyes  she bowed low before dorothy  she said “follow me  i  show you your room” so dorothy said goodbye  all her friends except toto  taking  dog  her arms followed  green girl through seven passages  up three flights

throne room   great oz first they came   great hall  which  many ladies  gentlemen   court all dressed  rich costumes these people had nothing  do but talk  each other but they always came  wait outside  throne room every morning although they  never permitted  see oz as dorothy entered they looked  her curiously  one  them whispered “are you really going  look upon  face  oz  terrible” “of course” answered  girl “if   see me” “oh   see you” said  soldier who had taken her message   wizard “although  does not like  have people ask  see him indeed  first   angry  said i should send you back where you came from then  asked me what you looked like  when i mentioned your silver shoes   very much interested at last i told him about  mark upon your forehead   decided  would admit you  his presence” just then  bell rang   green girl said  dorothy “that   signal you must go into  throne room alone” she opened  little door  dorothy walked boldly through  found herself   wonderful place it   big round room   high arched roof   walls  ceiling  floor  covered  large emeralds set closely together in  center   roof   great light  bright   sun which made  emeralds sparkle   wonderful manner but what interested dorothy most   big throne  green marble  stood   middle   room it  shaped like  chair  sparkled  gems  did everything else in  center   chair   enormous head without  body  support  or any arms or legs whatever there  no hair upon this head but  had eyes   nose  mouth   much bigger than  head   biggest giant as dorothy gazed upon this  wonder  fear  eyes turned slowly  looked  her sharply  steadily then  mouth moved  dorothy heard  voice say “i am oz  great  terrible who  you  why do you seek me” it  not such  awful voice  she had expected  come   big head so she took courage  answered “i am dorothy  small  meek i have come  you  help” the eyes looked  her thoughtfully   full minute then said  voice “where did you get  silver shoes” “i got them   wicked witch   east when my house fell  her  killed her” she replied “where did you get  mark upon your forehead” continued  voice “that  where  good witch   north kissed me when she bade me goodbye  sent me  you” said  girl again  eyes looked  her sharply  they saw she  telling  truth then oz asked “what do you wish me  do” “send me back  kansas where my aunt em  uncle henry are” she answered earnestly “i don’t like your country although   so beautiful and i am sure aunt em   dreadfully worried over my being away so long” the eyes winked three times  then they turned up   ceiling  down   floor  rolled around so queerly  they seemed  see every part   room and  last they looked  dorothy again “why should i do this  you” asked oz “because you  strong  i am weak because you   great wizard  i am only  little girl” “but you  strong enough  kill  wicked witch   east” said oz “that just happened” returned dorothy simply “i could not help it” “well” said  head “i  give you my answer you have no right  expect me  send you back  kansas unless you do something  me  return in this country everyone must pay  everything  gets if you wish me  use my magic power  send you home again you must do something  me first help me  i  help you” “what must i do” asked  girl “kill  wicked witch   west” answered oz “but i cannot” exclaimed dorothy greatly surprised “you killed  witch   east  you wear  silver shoes which bear  powerful charm there  now but one wicked witch left  all this land  when you can tell me she  dead i  send you back  kansas—but not before” the little girl began  weep she  so much disappointed   eyes winked again  looked upon her anxiously  if  great oz felt  she could help him if she would “i never killed anything willingly” she sobbed “even if i wanted to how could i kill  wicked witch if you who  great  terrible cannot kill her yourself how do you expect me  do it” “i do not know” said  head “but   my answer  until  wicked witch dies you  not see your uncle  aunt again remember   witch  wicked—tremendously wicked—and ought   killed now go  do not ask  see me again until you have done your task” sorrowfully dorothy left  throne room  went back where  lion   scarecrow   tin woodman  waiting  hear what oz had said  her “there  no hope  me” she said sadly “for oz  not send me home until i have killed  wicked witch   west   i can never do” her friends  sorry but could do nothing  help her so dorothy went  her own room  lay down   bed  cried herself  sleep the next morning  soldier   green whiskers came   scarecrow  said “come  me  oz  sent  you” so  scarecrow followed him   admitted into  great throne room where  saw sitting   emerald throne  most lovely lady she  dressed  green silk gauze  wore upon her flowing green locks  crown  jewels growing  her shoulders  wings gorgeous  color  so light  they fluttered if  slightest breath  air reached them when  scarecrow had bowed  prettily  his straw stuffing would let him before this beautiful creature she looked upon him sweetly  said “i am oz  great  terrible who  you  why do you seek me” now  scarecrow who had expected  see  great head dorothy had told him of  much astonished but  answered her bravely “i am only  scarecrow stuffed  straw therefore i have no brains  i come  you praying  you  put brains  my head instead  straw so  i may become  much  man  any other  your dominions” “why should i do this  you” asked  lady “because you  wise  powerful  no one else can help me” answered  scarecrow “i never grant favors without some return” said oz “but this much i  promise if you  kill  me  wicked witch   west i  bestow upon you  great many brains  such good brains  you    wisest man  all  land  oz” “i thought you asked dorothy  kill  witch” said  scarecrow  surprise “so i did i don’t care who kills her but until she  dead i  not grant your wish now go  do not seek me again until you have earned  brains you so greatly desire” the scarecrow went sorrowfully back  his friends  told them what oz had said  dorothy  surprised  find   great wizard  not  head  she had seen him but  lovely lady “all  same” said  scarecrow “she needs  heart  much   tin woodman” on  next morning  soldier   green whiskers came   tin woodman  said “oz  sent  you follow me” so  tin woodman followed him  came   great throne room he did not know whether  would find oz  lovely lady or  head but  hoped  would   lovely lady “for”  said  himself “if    head i am sure i shall not  given  heart since  head  no heart   own  therefore cannot feel  me but if    lovely lady i shall beg hard   heart  all ladies  themselves said   kindly hearted” but when  woodman entered  great throne room  saw neither  head nor  lady  oz had taken  shape   most terrible beast it  nearly  big   elephant   green throne seemed hardly strong enough  hold  weight the beast had  head like    rhinoceros only there  five eyes   face there  five long arms growing out   body   also had five long slim legs thick woolly hair covered every part  it   more dreadfullooking monster could not  imagined it  fortunate  tin woodman had no heart   moment   would have beat loud  fast  terror but being only tin  woodman  not  all afraid although   much disappointed “i am oz  great  terrible” spoke  beast   voice   one great roar “who  you  why do you seek me” “i am  woodman  made  tin therefore i have no heart  cannot love i pray you  give me  heart  i may   other men are” “why should i do this” demanded  beast “because i ask it  you alone can grant my request” answered  woodman oz gave  low growl  this but said gruffly “if you indeed desire  heart you must earn it” “how” asked  woodman “help dorothy  kill  wicked witch   west” replied  beast “when  witch  dead come  me  i  then give you  biggest  kindest  most loving heart  all  land  oz” so  tin woodman  forced  return sorrowfully  his friends  tell them   terrible beast  had seen they all wondered greatly   many forms  great wizard could take upon himself   lion said “if    beast when i go  see him i shall roar my loudest  so frighten him    grant all i ask and if    lovely lady i shall pretend  spring upon her  so compel her  do my bidding and if    great head     my mercy  i  roll this head all about  room until  promises  give us what we desire so   good cheer my friends  all  yet  well” the next morning  soldier   green whiskers led  lion   great throne room  bade him enter  presence  oz the lion  once passed through  door  glancing around saw  his surprise  before  throne   ball  fire so fierce  glowing  could scarcely bear  gaze upon it his first thought   oz had  accident caught  fire   burning up but when  tried  go nearer  heat  so intense   singed his whiskers   crept back tremblingly   spot nearer  door then  low quiet voice came   ball  fire  these   words  spoke “i am oz  great  terrible who  you  why do you seek me” and  lion answered “i am  cowardly lion afraid  everything i came  you  beg  you give me courage so   reality i may become  king  beasts  men call me” “why should i give you courage” demanded oz “because  all wizards you   greatest  alone have power  grant my request” answered  lion the ball  fire burned fiercely   time   voice said “bring me proof   wicked witch  dead   moment i  give you courage but  long   witch lives you must remain  coward” the lion  angry  this speech but could say nothing  reply  while  stood silently gazing   ball  fire  became so furiously hot   turned tail  rushed   room he  glad  find his friends waiting  him  told them  his terrible interview   wizard “what shall we do now” asked dorothy sadly “there  only one thing we can do” returned  lion “and    go   land   winkies seek out  wicked witch  destroy her” “but suppose we cannot” said  girl “then i shall never have courage” declared  lion “and i shall never have brains” added  scarecrow “and i shall never have  heart” spoke  tin woodman “and i shall never see aunt em  uncle henry” said dorothy beginning  cry “be careful” cried  green girl “the tears  fall  your green silk gown  spot it” so dorothy dried her eyes  said “i suppose we must try it but i am sure i do not want  kill anybody even  see aunt em again” “i  go  you but i’m too much   coward  kill  witch” said  lion “i  go too” declared  scarecrow “but i shall not   much help  you i am such  fool” “i haven’t  heart  harm even  witch” remarked  tin woodman “but if you go i certainly shall go  you” therefore   decided  start upon their journey  next morning   woodman sharpened his axe   green grindstone  had all his joints properly oiled the scarecrow stuffed himself  fresh straw  dorothy put new paint  his eyes   might see better the green girl who  very kind  them filled dorothy’s basket

fields  soft grass dotted here  there  daisies  buttercups dorothy still wore  pretty silk dress she had put    palace but now  her surprise she found   no longer green but pure white the ribbon around toto’s neck had also lost  green color    white  dorothy’s dress the emerald city  soon left far behind as they advanced  ground became rougher  hillier  there  no farms nor houses  this country   west   ground  untilled in  afternoon  sun shone hot  their faces  there  no trees  offer them shade so  before night dorothy  toto   lion  tired  lay down upon  grass  fell asleep   woodman   scarecrow keeping watch now  wicked witch   west had but one eye yet    powerful   telescope  could see everywhere so  she sat   door  her castle she happened  look around  saw dorothy lying asleep  her friends all about her they   long distance off but  wicked witch  angry  find them  her country so she blew upon  silver whistle  hung around her neck at once there came running  her  all directions  pack  great wolves they had long legs  fierce eyes  sharp teeth “go  those people” said  witch “and tear them  pieces” “are you not going  make them your slaves” asked  leader   wolves “no” she answered “one   tin  one  straw one   girl  another  lion none  them  fit  work so you may tear them into small pieces” “very well” said  wolf   dashed away  full speed followed   others it  lucky  scarecrow   woodman  wide awake  heard  wolves coming “this  my fight” said  woodman “so get behind me  i  meet them  they come” he seized his axe which  had made very sharp    leader   wolves came   tin woodman swung his arm  chopped  wolf’s head   body so   immediately died as soon   could raise his axe another wolf came up   also fell under  sharp edge   tin woodman’s weapon there  forty wolves  forty times  wolf  killed so   last they all lay dead   heap before  woodman then  put down his axe  sat beside  scarecrow who said “it   good fight friend” they waited until dorothy awoke  next morning the little girl  quite frightened when she saw  great pile  shaggy wolves but  tin woodman told her all she thanked him  saving them  sat down  breakfast after which they started again upon their journey now this same morning  wicked witch came   door  her castle  looked out  her one eye  could see far off she saw all her wolves lying dead   strangers still traveling through her country this made her angrier than before  she blew her silver whistle twice straightway  great flock  wild crows came flying toward her enough  darken  sky and  wicked witch said   king crow “fly  once   strangers peck out their eyes  tear them  pieces” the wild crows flew  one great flock toward dorothy  her companions when  little girl saw them coming she  afraid but  scarecrow said “this  my battle so lie down beside me  you  not  harmed” so they all lay upon  ground except  scarecrow   stood up  stretched out his arms and when  crows saw him they  frightened  these birds always   scarecrows  did not dare  come any nearer but  king crow said “it  only  stuffed man i  peck his eyes out” the king crow flew   scarecrow who caught    head  twisted  neck until  died and then another crow flew  him   scarecrow twisted  neck also there  forty crows  forty times  scarecrow twisted  neck until  last all  lying dead beside him then  called  his companions  rise  again they went upon their journey when  wicked witch looked out again  saw all her crows lying   heap she got into  terrible rage  blew three times upon her silver whistle forthwith there  heard  great buzzing   air   swarm  black bees came flying toward her “go   strangers  sting them  death” commanded  witch   bees turned  flew rapidly until they came  where dorothy  her friends  walking but  woodman had seen them coming   scarecrow had decided what  do “take out my straw  scatter  over  little girl   dog   lion”  said   woodman “and  bees cannot sting them” this  woodman did   dorothy lay close beside  lion  held toto  her arms  straw covered them entirely the bees came  found no one but  woodman  sting so they flew  him  broke off all their stings against  tin without hurting  woodman  all and  bees cannot live when their stings  broken    end   black bees  they lay scattered thick about  woodman like little heaps  fine coal then dorothy   lion got up   girl helped  tin woodman put  straw back into  scarecrow again until    good  ever so they started upon their journey once more the wicked witch  so angry when she saw her black bees  little heaps like fine coal  she stamped her foot  tore her hair  gnashed her teeth and then she called  dozen  her slaves who   winkies  gave them sharp spears telling them  go   strangers  destroy them the winkies  not  brave people but they had  do  they  told so they marched away until they came near  dorothy then  lion gave  great roar  sprang towards them   poor winkies  so frightened  they ran back  fast  they could when they returned   castle  wicked witch beat them well   strap  sent them back  their work after which she sat down  think what she should do next she could not understand how all her plans  destroy these strangers had failed but she   powerful witch  well   wicked one  she soon made up her mind how  act there was  her cupboard  golden cap   circle  diamonds  rubies running round it this golden cap had  charm whoever owned  could call three times upon  winged monkeys who would obey any order they  given but no person could command these strange creatures more than three times twice already  wicked witch had used  charm   cap once  when she had made  winkies her slaves  set herself  rule over their country the winged monkeys had helped her do this the second time  when she had fought against  great oz himself  driven him out   land   west the winged monkeys had also helped her  doing this only once more could she use this golden cap  which reason she did not like  do so until all her other powers  exhausted but now  her fierce wolves  her wild crows  her stinging bees  gone  her slaves had been scared away   cowardly lion she saw there  only one way left  destroy dorothy  her friends so  wicked witch took  golden cap  her cupboard  placed  upon her head then she stood upon her left foot  said slowly “eppe peppe kakke” next she stood upon her right foot  said “hillo hollo hello” after this she stood upon both feet  cried   loud voice “zizzy zuzzy zik” now  charm began  work the sky  darkened   low rumbling sound  heard   air there   rushing  many wings  great chattering  laughing   sun came out   dark sky  show  wicked witch surrounded   crowd  monkeys each   pair  immense  powerful wings  his shoulders one much bigger than  others seemed   their leader he flew close   witch  said “you have called us   third  last time what do you command” “go   strangers who  within my land  destroy them all except  lion” said  wicked witch “bring  beast  me  i have  mind  harness him like  horse  make him work” “your commands shall  obeyed” said  leader then   great deal  chattering  noise  winged monkeys flew away   place where dorothy  her friends  walking some   monkeys seized  tin woodman  carried him through  air until they  over  country thickly covered  sharp rocks here they dropped  poor woodman who fell  great distance   rocks where  lay so battered  dented   could neither move nor groan others   monkeys caught  scarecrow   their long fingers pulled all   straw out  his clothes  head they made his hat  boots  clothes into  small bundle  threw  into  top branches   tall tree the remaining monkeys threw pieces  stout rope around  lion  wound many coils about his body  head  legs until   unable  bite or scratch or struggle  any way then they lifted him up  flew away  him   witch’s castle where   placed   small yard   high iron fence around it so   could not escape but dorothy they did not harm  all she stood  toto  her arms watching  sad fate  her comrades  thinking  would soon  her turn the leader   winged monkeys flew up  her his long hairy arms stretched out  his ugly face grinning terribly but  saw  mark   good witch’s kiss upon her forehead  stopped short motioning  others not  touch her “we dare not harm this little girl”  said  them “for she  protected   power  good    greater than  power  evil all we can do   carry her   castle   wicked witch  leave her there” so carefully  gently they lifted dorothy  their arms  carried her swiftly through  air until they came   castle where they set her down upon  front doorstep then  leader said   witch “we have obeyed you  far  we  able the tin woodman   scarecrow  destroyed   lion  tied up  your yard the little girl we dare not harm nor  dog she carries  her arms your power over our band  now ended  you  never see us again” then all  winged monkeys  much laughing  chattering  noise flew into  air   soon out  sight the wicked witch  both surprised  worried when she saw  mark  dorothy’s forehead  she knew well  neither  winged monkeys nor she herself dare hurt  girl  any way she looked down  dorothy’s feet  seeing  silver shoes began  tremble  fear  she knew what  powerful charm belonged  them at first  witch  tempted  run away  dorothy but she happened  look into  child’s eyes  saw how simple  soul behind them was    little girl did not know   wonderful power  silver shoes gave her so  wicked witch laughed  herself  thought “i can still make her my slave  she does not know how  use her power” then she said  dorothy harshly  severely “come  me  see  you mind everything i tell you  if you do not i  make  end  you  i did   tin woodman   scarecrow” dorothy followed her through many   beautiful rooms  her castle until they came   kitchen where  witch bade her clean  pots  kettles  sweep  floor  keep  fire fed  wood dorothy went  work meekly  her mind made up  work  hard  she could  she  glad  wicked witch had decided not  kill her with dorothy hard  work  witch thought she would go into  courtyard  harness  cowardly lion like  horse  would amuse her she  sure  make him draw her chariot whenever she wished  go  drive but  she opened  gate  lion gave  loud roar  bounded  her so fiercely   witch  afraid  ran out  shut  gate again “if i cannot harness you” said  witch   lion speaking through  bars   gate “i can starve you you shall have nothing  eat until you do  i wish” so after  she took no food   imprisoned lion but every day she came   gate  noon  asked “are you ready   harnessed like  horse” and  lion would answer “no if you come  this yard i  bite you” the reason  lion did not have  do   witch wished   every night while  woman  asleep dorothy carried him food   cupboard after  had eaten  would lie down  his bed  straw  dorothy would lie beside him  put her head  his soft shaggy mane while they talked  their troubles  tried  plan some way  escape but they could find no way  get out   castle    constantly guarded   yellow winkies who   slaves   wicked witch  too afraid  her not  do  she told them the girl had  work hard during  day  often  witch threatened  beat her   same old umbrella she always carried  her hand but  truth she did not dare  strike dorothy because   mark upon her forehead the child did not know this   full  fear  herself  toto once  witch struck toto  blow  her umbrella   brave little dog flew  her  bit her leg  return the witch did not bleed where she  bitten  she  so wicked   blood  her had dried up many years before dorothy’s life became very sad  she grew  understand   would  harder than ever  get back  kansas  aunt em again sometimes she would cry bitterly  hours  toto sitting  her feet  looking into her face whining dismally  show how sorry    his little mistress toto did not really care whether    kansas or  land  oz so long  dorothy   him but  knew  little girl  unhappy   made him unhappy too now  wicked witch had  great longing  have  her own  silver shoes which  girl always wore her bees  her crows  her wolves  lying  heaps  drying up  she had used up all  power   golden cap but if she could only get hold   silver shoes they would give her more power than all  other things she had lost she watched dorothy carefully  see if she ever took off her shoes thinking she might steal them but  child  so proud  her pretty shoes  she never took them off except  night  when she took her bath the witch  too much afraid   dark  dare go  dorothy’s room  night  take  shoes  her dread  water  greater than her fear   dark so she never came near when dorothy  bathing indeed  old witch never touched water nor ever let water touch her  any way but  wicked creature  very cunning  she finally thought   trick  would give her what she wanted she placed  bar  iron   middle   kitchen floor  then  her magic arts made  iron invisible  human eyes so  when dorothy walked across  floor she stumbled over  bar not being able  see it  fell  full length she  not much hurt but  her fall one   silver shoes came off  before she could reach it  witch had snatched  away  put   her own skinny foot the wicked woman  greatly pleased   success  her trick   long  she had one   shoes she owned half  power  their charm  dorothy could not use  against her even had she known how  do so the little girl seeing she had lost one  her pretty shoes grew angry  said   witch “give me back my shoe” “i  not” retorted  witch “for   now my shoe  not yours” “you   wicked creature” cried dorothy “you have no right  take my shoe  me” “i shall keep it just  same” said  witch laughing  her “and someday i shall get  other one  you too” this made dorothy so very angry  she picked up  bucket  water  stood near  dashed  over  witch wetting her  head  foot instantly  wicked woman gave  loud cry  fear  then  dorothy looked  her  wonder  witch began  shrink  fall away “see what you have done” she screamed “in  minute i shall melt away” “i’m very sorry indeed” said dorothy who  truly frightened  see  witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes “didn’t you know water would   end  me” asked  witch   wailing despairing voice “of course not” answered dorothy “how should i” “well   few minutes i shall  all melted  you  have  castle  yourself i have been wicked  my day but i never thought  little girl like you would ever  able  melt me  end my wicked deeds look out—here i go” with these words  witch fell down   brown melted shapeless mass  began  spread over  clean boards   kitchen floor seeing  she had really melted away  nothing dorothy drew another bucket  water  threw  over  mess she then swept  all out  door after picking out  silver shoe which  all   left   old woman she cleaned  dried    cloth  put   her foot again then being  last free  do  she chose she ran out   courtyard  tell

 yellow winkies  asked them if they would help  rescue their friends   winkies said  they would  delighted  do all  their power  dorothy who had set them free  bondage so she chose  number   winkies who looked  if they knew  most  they all started away they traveled  day  part   next until they came   rocky plain where  tin woodman lay all battered  bent his axe  near him but  blade  rusted   handle broken off short the winkies lifted him tenderly  their arms  carried him back   yellow castle again dorothy shedding  few tears   way   sad plight  her old friend   lion looking sober  sorry when they reached  castle dorothy said   winkies “are any  your people tinsmiths” “oh yes some  us  very good tinsmiths” they told her “then bring them  me” she said and when  tinsmiths came bringing  them all their tools  baskets she inquired “can you straighten out those dents   tin woodman  bend him back into shape again  solder him together where   broken” the tinsmiths looked  woodman over carefully  then answered  they thought they could mend him so  would   good  ever so they set  work  one   big yellow rooms   castle  worked  three days  four nights hammering  twisting  bending

often   tip  his tail   became quite wet    obliged  go out into  courtyard  hold    sun till  dried “if we only had  scarecrow  us again” said  tin woodman when dorothy had finished telling him everything  had happened “i should  quite happy” “we must try  find him” said  girl so she called  winkies  help her  they walked all  day  part   next until they came   tall tree   branches  which  winged monkeys had tossed  scarecrow’s clothes it   very tall tree   trunk  so smooth  no one could climb it but  woodman said  once “i’ll chop  down  then we can get  scarecrow’s clothes” now while  tinsmiths had been  work mending  woodman himself another   winkies who   goldsmith had made  axehandle  solid gold  fitted    woodman’s axe instead   old broken handle others polished  blade until all  rust  removed   glistened like burnished silver as soon   had spoken  tin woodman began  chop    short time  tree fell over   crash whereupon  scarecrow’s clothes fell out   branches  rolled off

travelers made  winkies  pretty speech  return  all shook hands  them until their arms ached dorothy went   witch’s cupboard  fill her basket  food   journey  there she saw  golden cap she tried   her own head  found   fitted her exactly she did not know anything about  charm   golden cap but she saw    pretty so she made up her mind  wear   carry her sunbonnet   basket then being prepared   journey they all started   emerald city   winkies gave them three cheers  many good wishes  carry  them chapter xiv the winged monkeys you  remember there  no road—not even  pathway—between  castle   wicked witch   emerald city when  four travelers went  search   witch she had seen them coming  so sent  winged monkeys  bring them  her it  much harder  find their way back through  big fields  buttercups  yellow daisies than   being carried they knew  course they must go straight east toward  rising sun  they started off   right way but  noon when  sun  over their heads they did not know which  east  which  west     reason they  lost   great fields they kept  walking however   night  moon came out  shone brightly so they lay down among  sweet smelling yellow flowers  slept soundly until morning—all but  scarecrow   tin woodman the next morning  sun  behind  cloud but they started on  if they  quite sure which way they  going “if we walk far enough” said dorothy “i am sure we shall sometime come  some place” but day  day passed away  they still saw nothing before them but  scarlet fields the scarecrow began  grumble  bit “we have surely lost our way”  said “and unless we find  again  time  reach  emerald city i shall never get my brains” “nor i my heart” declared  tin woodman “it seems  me i can scarcely wait till i get  oz  you must admit this   very long journey” “you see” said  cowardly lion   whimper “i haven’t  courage  keep tramping forever without getting anywhere  all” then dorothy lost heart she sat down   grass  looked  her companions  they sat down  looked  her  toto found    first time  his life   too tired  chase  butterfly  flew past his head so  put out his tongue  panted  looked  dorothy  if  ask what they should do next “suppose we call  field mice” she suggested “they could probably tell us  way   emerald city” “to  sure they could” cried  scarecrow “why didn’t we think   before” dorothy blew  little whistle she had always carried about her neck since  queen   mice had given   her in  few minutes they heard  pattering  tiny feet  many   small gray mice came running up  her among them   queen herself who asked  her squeaky little voice “what can i do  my friends” “we have lost our way” said dorothy “can you tell us where  emerald city is” “certainly” answered  queen “but    great way off  you have had   your backs all this time” then she noticed dorothy’s golden cap  said “why don’t you use  charm   cap  call  winged monkeys  you they  carry you   city  oz  less than  hour” “i didn’t know there   charm” answered dorothy  surprise “what  it” “it  written inside  golden cap” replied  queen   mice “but if you  going  call  winged monkeys we must run away  they  full  mischief  think  great fun  plague us” “won’t they hurt me” asked  girl anxiously “oh no they must obey  wearer   cap goodbye” and she scampered out  sight  all  mice hurrying after her dorothy looked inside  golden cap  saw some words written upon  lining these she thought must   charm so she read  directions carefully  put  cap upon her head “eppe peppe kakke” she said standing  her left foot “what did you say” asked  scarecrow who did not know what she  doing “hillo hollo hello” dorothy went on standing this time  her right foot “hello” replied  tin woodman calmly “zizzy zuzzy zik” said dorothy who  now standing  both feet this ended  saying   charm  they heard  great chattering  flapping  wings   band  winged monkeys flew up  them the king bowed low before dorothy  asked “what  your command” “we wish  go   emerald city” said  child “and we have lost our way” “we  carry you” replied  king  no sooner had  spoken than two   monkeys caught dorothy  their arms  flew away  her others took  scarecrow   woodman   lion  one little monkey seized toto  flew after them although  dog tried hard  bite him the scarecrow   tin woodman  rather frightened  first  they remembered how badly  winged monkeys had treated them before but they saw  no harm  intended so they rode through  air quite cheerfully  had  fine time looking   pretty gardens  woods far below them dorothy found herself riding easily between two   biggest monkeys one  them  king himself they had made  chair  their hands   careful not  hurt her “why do you have  obey  charm   golden cap” she asked “that   long story” answered  king   winged laugh “but  we have  long journey before us i  pass  time  telling you about it if you wish” “i shall  glad  hear it” she replied “once” began  leader “we   free people living happily   great forest flying  tree

saw  green shining walls   emerald city before them she wondered   rapid flight   monkeys but  glad  journey  over the strange creatures set  travelers down carefully before  gate   city  king bowed low  dorothy  then flew swiftly away followed  all his band “that   good ride” said  little girl “yes   quick way out  our troubles” replied  lion “how lucky   you brought away  wonderful cap” chapter

wonder “she could not help it  she  melted” explained  scarecrow “melted well   good news indeed” said  man “who melted her” “it  dorothy” said  lion gravely “good gracious” exclaimed  man   bowed very low indeed before her then  led them into his little room  locked  spectacles   great box  all their eyes just   had done before afterward they passed  through  gate into  emerald city when  people heard   guardian   gates  dorothy had melted  wicked witch   west they all gathered around  travelers  followed them   great crowd   palace  oz the soldier   green whiskers  still  guard before

 had taken before  all  greatly surprised when they looked about  saw no one  all   room they kept close   door  closer  one another   stillness   empty room  more dreadful than any   forms they had seen oz take presently they heard  solemn voice  seemed  come  somewhere near  top   great dome   said “i am oz  great  terrible why do you seek me” they looked again  every part   room  then seeing no one dorothy asked “where  you” “i am everywhere” answered  voice “but   eyes  common mortals i am invisible i  now seat myself upon my throne  you may converse  me” indeed  voice seemed just then  come straight   throne itself so they walked toward   stood   row while dorothy said “we have come  claim our promise o oz” “what promise” asked oz “you promised  send me back  kansas when  wicked witch  destroyed” said  girl “and you promised  give me brains” said  scarecrow “and you promised  give me  heart” said  tin woodman “and you promised  give me courage” said  cowardly lion “is  wicked witch really destroyed” asked  voice  dorothy thought  trembled  little “yes” she answered “i melted her   bucket  water” “dear me” said  voice “how sudden well come  me tomorrow  i must have time  think  over” “you’ve had plenty  time already” said  tin woodman angrily “we shan’t wait  day longer” said  scarecrow “you must keep your promises  us” exclaimed dorothy the lion thought  might   well  frighten  wizard so  gave  large loud roar which  so fierce  dreadful  toto jumped away  him  alarm  tipped over  screen  stood   corner as  fell   crash they looked  way   next moment all  them  filled  wonder for they saw standing  just  spot  screen had hidden  little old man   bald head   wrinkled face who seemed    much surprised  they were the tin woodman raising his axe rushed toward  little man  cried out “who  you” “i am oz  great  terrible” said  little man   trembling voice “but don’t strike me—please don’t—and i’ll do anything you want me to” our friends looked  him  surprise  dismay “i thought oz   great head” said dorothy “and i thought oz   lovely lady” said  scarecrow “and i thought oz   terrible beast” said  tin woodman “and i thought oz   ball  fire” exclaimed  lion “no you  all wrong” said  little man meekly “i have been making believe” “making believe” cried dorothy “are you not  great wizard” “hush my dear”  said “don’t speak so loud or you   overheard—and i should  ruined i’m supposed    great wizard” “and aren’t you” she asked “not  bit  it my dear i’m just  common man” “you’re more than that” said  scarecrow   grieved tone “you’re  humbug” “exactly so” declared  little man rubbing his hands together  if  pleased him “i am  humbug” “but this  terrible” said  tin woodman “how shall i ever get my heart” “or i my courage” asked  lion “or i my brains” wailed  scarecrow wiping  tears  his eyes  his coat sleeve “my dear friends” said oz “i pray you not  speak  these little things think  me   terrible trouble i’m   being found out” “doesn’t anyone else know you’re  humbug” asked dorothy “no one knows  but you four—and myself” replied oz “i have fooled everyone so long  i thought i should never  found out it   great mistake my ever letting you into  throne room usually i  not see even my subjects  so they believe i am something terrible” “but i don’t understand” said dorothy  bewilderment “how    you appeared  me   great head” “that  one  my tricks” answered oz “step this way please  i  tell you all about it” he led  way   small chamber   rear   throne room  they all followed him he pointed  one corner  which lay  great head made out  many thicknesses  paper    carefully painted face “this i hung   ceiling   wire” said oz “i stood behind  screen  pulled  thread  make  eyes move   mouth open” “but how about  voice” she inquired “oh i am  ventriloquist” said  little man “i can throw  sound  my voice wherever i wish so  you thought   coming out   head here   other things i used  deceive you” he showed  scarecrow  dress   mask  had worn when  seemed    lovely lady and  tin woodman saw  his terrible beast  nothing but  lot  skins sewn together  slats  keep their sides out as   ball  fire  false wizard had hung  also   ceiling it  really  ball  cotton but when oil  poured upon   ball burned fiercely “really” said  scarecrow “you ought   ashamed  yourself  being such  humbug” “i am—i certainly am” answered  little man sorrowfully “but    only thing i could do sit down please there  plenty  chairs  i  tell you my story” so they sat down  listened while  told  following tale “i  born  omaha—” “why  isn’t very far  kansas” cried dorothy “no but it’s farther  here”  said shaking his head  her sadly “when i grew up i became  ventriloquist    i  very well trained   great master i can imitate any kind   bird or beast” here  mewed so like  kitten  toto pricked up his ears  looked everywhere  see where she was “after  time” continued oz “i tired  that  became  balloonist” “what  that” asked dorothy “a man who goes up   balloon  circus day so   draw  crowd  people together  get them  pay  see  circus”  explained “oh” she said “i know” “well one day i went up   balloon   ropes got twisted so  i couldn’t come down again it went way up above  clouds so far   current  air struck   carried  many many miles away for  day   night i traveled through  air    morning   second day i awoke  found  balloon floating over  strange  beautiful country “it came down gradually  i  not hurt  bit but i found myself   midst   strange people who seeing me come   clouds thought i   great wizard of course i let them think so because they  afraid  me  promised  do anything i wished them to “just  amuse myself  keep  good people busy i ordered them  build this city  my palace  they did  all willingly  well then i thought   country  so green  beautiful i would call   emerald city   make  name fit better i put green spectacles  all  people so  everything they saw  green” “but isn’t everything here green” asked dorothy “no more than  any other city” replied oz “but when you wear green spectacles why  course everything you see looks green  you the emerald city  built  great many years ago  i   young man when  balloon brought me here  i am  very old man now but my people have worn green glasses  their eyes so long  most  them think  really   emerald city   certainly   beautiful place abounding  jewels  precious metals  every good thing   needed  make one happy i have been good   people  they like me but ever since this palace  built i have shut myself up  would not see any  them “one  my greatest fears   witches  while i had no magical powers  all i soon found out   witches  really able  do wonderful things there  four  them  this country  they ruled  people who live   north  south  east  west fortunately  witches   north  south  good  i knew they would do me no harm but  witches   east  west  terribly wicked  had they not thought i  more powerful than they themselves they would surely have destroyed me as  was i lived  deadly fear  them  many years so you can imagine how pleased i  when i heard your house had fallen   wicked witch   east when you came  me i  willing  promise anything if you would only do away   other witch but now  you have melted her i am ashamed  say  i cannot keep my promises” “i think you   very bad man” said dorothy “oh no my dear i’m really  very good man but i’m  very bad wizard i must admit” “can’t you give me brains” asked  scarecrow “you don’t need them you  learning something every day a baby  brains but  doesn’t know much experience   only thing  brings knowledge   longer you   earth  more experience you  sure  get” “that may all  true” said  scarecrow “but i shall  very unhappy unless you give me brains” the false wizard looked  him carefully “well”  said   sigh “i’m not much   magician  i said but if you  come  me tomorrow morning i  stuff your head  brains i cannot tell you how  use them however you must find  out  yourself” “oh thank you—thank you” cried  scarecrow “i’ll find  way  use them never fear” “but how about my courage” asked  lion anxiously “you have plenty  courage i am sure” answered oz “all you need  confidence  yourself there  no living thing   not afraid when  faces danger the true courage   facing danger when you  afraid   kind  courage you have  plenty” “perhaps i have but i’m scared just  same” said  lion “i shall really  very unhappy unless you give me  sort  courage  makes one forget   afraid” “very well i  give you  sort  courage tomorrow” replied oz “how about my heart” asked  tin woodman “why   that” answered oz “i think you  wrong  want  heart it makes most people unhappy if you only knew it you   luck not  have  heart” “that must   matter  opinion” said  tin woodman “for my part i  bear all  unhappiness without  murmur if you  give me  heart” “very well” answered oz meekly “come  me tomorrow  you shall have  heart i have played wizard  so many years  i may  well continue  part  little longer” “and now” said dorothy “how am i  get back  kansas” “we shall have  think about that” replied  little man “give me two or three days  consider  matter  i’ll try  find  way  carry you over  desert in  meantime you shall all  treated  my guests  while you live   palace my people  wait upon you  obey your slightest wish there  only one thing i ask  return  my help—such   is you must keep my secret  tell no one i am  humbug” they agreed  say nothing  what they had learned  went back  their rooms  high spirits even dorothy had hope  “the great  terrible humbug”  she called him would find  way  send her back  kansas  if  did she  willing  forgive him everything chapter xvi the magic art   great humbug next morning  scarecrow said  his friends “congratulate me i am going  oz  get my brains  last when i return i shall   other men are” “i have always liked you  you were” said dorothy simply “it  kind  you  like  scarecrow”  replied “but surely you  think more  me when you hear  splendid thoughts my new brain  going  turn out” then  said goodbye  them all   cheerful voice  went   throne room where  rapped upon  door “come in” said oz the scarecrow went   found  little man sitting down   window engaged  deep thought “i have come  my brains” remarked  scarecrow  little uneasily “oh yes sit down   chair please” replied oz “you must excuse me  taking your head off but i shall have  do   order  put your brains  their proper place” “that’s all right” said  scarecrow “you  quite welcome  take my head off  long      better one when you put   again” so  wizard unfastened his head  emptied out  straw then  entered  back room  took up  measure  bran which  mixed   great many pins  needles having shaken them together thoroughly  filled  top   scarecrow’s head   mixture  stuffed  rest   space  straw  hold   place when  had fastened  scarecrow’s head  his body again  said  him “hereafter you    great man  i have given you  lot  brannew brains” the scarecrow  both pleased  proud   fulfillment  his greatest wish  having thanked oz warmly  went back  his friends dorothy looked  him curiously his head  quite bulged out   top  brains “how do you feel” she asked “i feel wise indeed”  answered earnestly “when i get used  my brains i shall know everything” “why  those needles  pins sticking out  your head” asked  tin woodman “that  proof    sharp” remarked  lion “well i must go  oz  get my heart” said  woodman so  walked   throne room  knocked   door “come in” called oz   woodman entered  said “i have come  my heart” “very well” answered  little man “but i shall have  cut  hole  your breast so i can put your heart   right place i hope  won’t hurt you” “oh no” answered  woodman “i shall not feel   all” so oz brought  pair  tinsmith’s shears  cut  small square hole   left side   tin woodman’s breast then going   chest  drawers  took out  pretty heart made entirely  silk  stuffed  sawdust “isn’t   beauty”  asked “it is indeed” replied  woodman who  greatly pleased “but    kind heart” “oh very” answered oz he put  heart   woodman’s breast  then replaced  square  tin soldering  neatly together where  had been cut “there” said he “now you have  heart  any man might  proud of i’m sorry i had  put  patch  your breast but  really couldn’t  helped” “never mind  patch” exclaimed  happy woodman “i am very grateful  you  shall never forget your kindness” “don’t speak  it” replied oz then  tin woodman went back  his friends who wished him every joy  account  his good fortune the lion now walked   throne room  knocked   door “come in” said oz “i have come  my courage” announced  lion entering  room “very well” answered  little man “i  get   you” he went   cupboard  reaching up   high shelf took down  square green bottle  contents  which  poured into  greengold dish beautifully carved placing this before  cowardly lion who sniffed    if  did not like it  wizard said “drink” “what  it” asked  lion “well” answered oz “if   inside  you  would  courage you know  course  courage  always inside one so  this really cannot  called courage until you have swallowed it therefore i advise you  drink   soon  possible” the lion hesitated no longer but drank till  dish  empty “how do you feel now” asked oz “full  courage” replied  lion who went joyfully back  his friends  tell them  his good fortune oz left  himself smiled  think  his success  giving  scarecrow   tin woodman   lion exactly what they thought they wanted “how can i help being  humbug”  said “when all these people make me do things  everybody knows can’t  done it  easy  make  scarecrow   lion   woodman happy because they imagined i could do anything but   take more than imagination  carry dorothy back  kansas  i’m sure i don’t know how  can  done” chapter xvii how  balloon was launched for three days dorothy heard nothing  oz these  sad days   little girl although her friends  all quite happy  contented the scarecrow told them there  wonderful thoughts  his head but  would not say what they  because  knew no one could understand them but himself when  tin woodman walked about  felt his heart rattling around  his breast   told dorothy  had discovered     kinder  more tender heart than  one  had owned when   made  flesh the lion declared   afraid  nothing  earth  would gladly face  army or  dozen   fierce kalidahs thus each   little party  satisfied except dorothy who longed more than ever  get back  kansas on  fourth day  her great joy oz sent  her  when she entered  throne room  greeted her pleasantly “sit down my dear i think i have found  way  get you out  this country” “and back  kansas” she asked eagerly “well i’m not sure about kansas” said oz “for i haven’t  faintest notion which way  lies but  first thing  do   cross  desert  then  should  easy  find your way home” “how can i cross  desert” she inquired “well i’ll tell you what i think” said  little man “you see when i came  this country     balloon you also came through  air being carried   cyclone so i believe  best way  get across  desert   through  air now   quite beyond my powers  make  cyclone but i’ve been thinking  matter over  i believe i can make  balloon” “how” asked dorothy “a balloon” said oz “is made  silk which  coated  glue  keep  gas  it i have plenty  silk   palace so    no trouble  make  balloon but  all this country there  no gas  fill  balloon with  make  float” “if  won’t float” remarked dorothy “it    no use  us” “true” answered oz “but there  another way  make  float which   fill   hot air hot air isn’t  good  gas  if  air should get cold  balloon would come down   desert  we should  lost” “we” exclaimed  girl “are you going  me” “yes  course” replied oz “i am tired  being such  humbug if i should go out  this palace my people would soon discover i am not  wizard  then they would  vexed  me  having deceived them so i have  stay shut up  these rooms all day   gets tiresome i’d much rather go back  kansas  you     circus again” “i shall  glad  have your company” said dorothy “thank you”  answered “now if you  help me sew  silk together we  begin  work  our balloon” so dorothy took  needle  thread   fast  oz cut  strips  silk into proper shape  girl sewed them neatly together first there   strip  light green silk then  strip  dark green  then  strip  emerald green  oz had  fancy  make  balloon  different shades   color about them it took three days  sew all  strips together but when   finished they had  big bag  green silk more than twenty feet long then oz painted    inside   coat  thin glue  make  airtight after which  announced   balloon  ready “but we must have  basket  ride in”  said so  sent  soldier   green whiskers   big clothes basket which  fastened  many ropes   bottom   balloon when   all ready oz sent word  his people    going  make  visit   great brother wizard who lived   clouds the news spread rapidly throughout  city  everyone came  see  wonderful sight oz ordered  balloon carried out  front   palace   people gazed upon   much curiosity the tin woodman had chopped  big pile  wood  now  made  fire  it  oz held  bottom   balloon over  fire so   hot air  arose   would  caught   silken bag gradually  balloon swelled out  rose into  air until finally  basket just touched  ground then oz got into  basket  said  all  people   loud voice “i am now going away  make  visit while i am gone  scarecrow  rule over you i command you  obey him  you would me” the balloon   this time tugging hard   rope  held    ground   air within   hot  this made  so much lighter  weight than  air without   pulled hard  rise into  sky “come dorothy” cried  wizard “hurry up or  balloon  fly away” “i can’t find toto anywhere” replied dorothy who did not wish  leave her little dog behind toto had run into  crowd  bark   kitten  dorothy  last found him she picked him up  ran towards  balloon she  within  few steps  it  oz  holding out his hands  help her into  basket when crack went  ropes   balloon rose into  air without her “come back” she screamed “i want  go too” “i can’t come back my dear” called oz   basket “goodbye” “goodbye” shouted everyone  all eyes  turned upward  where  wizard  riding   basket rising every moment farther  farther into  sky and    last any  them ever saw  oz  wonderful wizard though  may have reached omaha safely   there now  all we know but  people remembered him lovingly  said  one another “oz  always our friend when   here  built  us this beautiful emerald city  now   gone   left  wise scarecrow  rule over us” still  many days they grieved over  loss   wonderful wizard  would not  comforted chapter xviii away   south dorothy wept bitterly   passing  her hope  get home  kansas again but when she thought  all over she  glad she had not gone up   balloon and she also felt sorry  losing oz  so did her companions the tin woodman came  her  said “truly i should  ungrateful if i failed  mourn   man who gave me my lovely heart i should like  cry  little because oz  gone if you  kindly wipe away my tears so  i shall not rust” “with pleasure” she answered  brought  towel  once then  tin woodman wept  several minutes  she watched  tears carefully  wiped them away   towel when  had finished  thanked her kindly  oiled himself thoroughly  his jeweled oilcan  guard against mishap the scarecrow  now  ruler   emerald city  although   not  wizard  people  proud  him “for” they said “there  not another city  all  world   ruled   stuffed man” and so far  they knew they  quite right the morning after  balloon had gone up  oz  four travelers met   throne room  talked matters over the scarecrow sat   big throne   others stood respectfully before him “we  not so unlucky” said  new ruler “for this palace   emerald city belong  us  we can do just  we please when i remember   short time ago i  up   pole   farmer’s cornfield   now i am  ruler  this beautiful city i am quite satisfied  my lot” “i also” said  tin woodman “am wellpleased  my new heart and really    only thing i wished  all  world” “for my part i am content  knowing i am  brave  any beast  ever lived if not braver” said  lion modestly “if dorothy would only  contented  live   emerald city” continued  scarecrow “we might all  happy together” “but i don’t want  live here” cried dorothy “i want  go  kansas  live  aunt em  uncle henry” “well then what can  done” inquired  woodman the scarecrow decided  think   thought so hard   pins  needles began  stick out  his brains finally  said “why not call  winged monkeys  ask them  carry you over  desert” “i never thought  that” said dorothy joyfully “it’s just  thing i’ll go  once   golden cap” when she brought  into  throne room she spoke  magic words  soon  band  winged monkeys flew  through  open window  stood beside her “this   second time you have called us” said  monkey king bowing before  little girl “what do you wish” “i want you  fly  me  kansas” said dorothy but  monkey king shook his head “that cannot  done”  said “we belong  this country alone  cannot leave it there  never been  winged monkey  kansas yet  i suppose there never  be  they don’t belong there we shall  glad  serve you  any way  our power but we cannot cross  desert goodbye” and  another bow  monkey king spread his wings  flew away through  window followed  all his band dorothy  ready  cry  disappointment “i have wasted  charm   golden cap  no purpose” she said “for  winged monkeys cannot help me” “it  certainly too bad” said  tenderhearted woodman the scarecrow  thinking again  his head bulged out so horribly  dorothy feared  would burst “let us call   soldier   green whiskers”  said “and ask his advice” so  soldier  summoned  entered  throne room timidly  while oz  alive  never  allowed  come farther than  door “this little girl” said  scarecrow   soldier “wishes  cross  desert how can she do so” “i cannot tell” answered  soldier “for nobody  ever crossed  desert unless   oz himself” “is there no one who can help me” asked dorothy earnestly “glinda might”  suggested “who  glinda” inquired  scarecrow “the witch   south she   most powerful  all  witches  rules over  quadlings besides her castle stands   edge   desert so she may know  way  cross it” “glinda   good witch isn’t she” asked  child “the quadlings think she  good” said  soldier “and she  kind  everyone i have heard  glinda   beautiful woman who knows how  keep young  spite   many years she  lived” “how can i get  her castle” asked dorothy “the road  straight   south”  answered “but   said   full  dangers  travelers there  wild beasts   woods   race  queer men who do not like strangers  cross their country for this reason none   quadlings ever come   emerald city” the soldier then left them   scarecrow said “it seems  spite  dangers   best thing dorothy can do   travel   land   south  ask glinda  help her for  course if dorothy stays here she  never get back  kansas” “you must have been thinking again” remarked  tin woodman “i have” said  scarecrow “i shall go  dorothy” declared  lion “for i am tired  your city  long   woods   country again i am really  wild beast you know besides dorothy  need someone  protect her” “that  true” agreed  woodman “my axe may   service  her so i also  go  her   land   south” “when shall we start” asked  scarecrow “are you going” they asked  surprise “certainly if  wasn’t  dorothy i should never have had brains she lifted me   pole   cornfield  brought me   emerald city so my good luck  all due  her  i shall never leave her until she starts back  kansas  good  all” “thank you” said dorothy gratefully “you  all very kind  me but i should like  start  soon  possible” “we shall go tomorrow morning” returned  scarecrow “so now let us all get ready      long journey” chapter xix attacked   fighting trees the next morning dorothy kissed  pretty green girl goodbye  they all shook hands   soldier   green whiskers who had walked  them  far   gate when  guardian   gate saw them again  wondered greatly  they could leave  beautiful city  get into new trouble but   once unlocked their spectacles which  put back into  green box  gave them many good wishes  carry  them “you  now our ruler”  said   scarecrow “so you must come back  us  soon  possible” “i certainly shall if i am able”  scarecrow replied “but i must help dorothy  get home first” as dorothy bade  goodnatured guardian  last farewell she said “i have been very kindly treated  your lovely city  everyone  been good  me i cannot tell you how grateful i am” “don’t try my dear”  answered “we should like  keep you  us but if   your wish  return  kansas i hope you  find  way” he then opened  gate   outer wall  they walked forth  started upon their journey the sun shone brightly  our friends turned their faces toward  land   south they  all   best  spirits  laughed  chatted together dorothy  once more filled   hope  getting home   scarecrow   tin woodman  glad    use  her as   lion  sniffed  fresh air  delight  whisked his tail  side  side  pure joy  being   country again while toto ran around them  chased  moths  butterflies barking merrily all  time “city life does not agree  me  all” remarked  lion  they walked along   brisk pace “i have lost much flesh since i lived there  now i am anxious   chance  show  other beasts how courageous i have grown” they now turned  took  last look   emerald city all they could see   mass  towers  steeples behind  green walls  high up above everything  spires  dome   palace  oz “oz  not such  bad wizard after all” said  tin woodman   felt his heart rattling around  his breast “he knew how  give me brains  very good brains too” said  scarecrow “if oz had taken  dose   same courage  gave me” added  lion “he would have been  brave man” dorothy said nothing oz had not kept  promise  made her but  had done his best so she forgave him as  said    good man even if    bad wizard the first day’s journey  through  green fields  bright flowers  stretched about  emerald city  every side they slept  night   grass  nothing but  stars over them  they rested very well indeed in  morning they traveled  until they came   thick wood there  no way  going around it   seemed  extend   right  left  far  they could see and besides they did not dare change  direction  their journey  fear  getting lost so they looked   place where  would  easiest  get into  forest the scarecrow who    lead finally discovered  big tree  such widespreading branches  there  room   party  pass underneath so  walked forward   tree but just   came under  first branches they bent down  twined around him   next minute   raised   ground  flung headlong among his fellow travelers this did not hurt  scarecrow but  surprised him   looked rather dizzy when dorothy picked him up “here  another space between  trees” called  lion “let me try  first” said  scarecrow “for  doesn’t hurt me  get thrown about” he walked up  another tree   spoke but  branches immediately seized him  tossed him back again “this  strange” exclaimed dorothy “what shall we do” “the trees seem  have made up their minds  fight us  stop our journey” remarked  lion “i believe i  try  myself” said  woodman  shouldering his axe  marched up   first tree  had handled  scarecrow so roughly when  big branch bent down  seize him  woodman chopped   so fiercely   cut   two at once  tree began shaking all  branches  if  pain   tin woodman passed safely under it “come on”  shouted   others “be quick” they all ran forward  passed under  tree without injury except toto who  caught   small branch  shaken until  howled but  woodman promptly chopped off  branch  set  little dog free the other trees   forest did nothing  keep them back so they made up their minds  only  first row  trees could bend down their branches   probably these   policemen   forest  given this wonderful power  order  keep strangers out  it the four travelers walked  ease through  trees until they came   farther edge   wood then  their surprise they found before them  high wall which seemed   made  white china it  smooth like  surface   dish  higher than their heads “what shall we do now” asked dorothy “i  make  ladder” said  tin woodman “for we certainly must climb over  wall” chapter xx the dainty china country while  woodman  making  ladder  wood which  found   forest dorothy lay down  slept  she  tired   long walk the lion also curled himself up  sleep  toto lay beside him the scarecrow watched  woodman while  worked  said  him “i cannot think why this wall  here nor what   made of” “rest your brains  do not worry about  wall” replied  woodman “when we have climbed over it we shall know what    other side” after  time  ladder  finished it looked clumsy but  tin woodman  sure   strong  would answer their purpose the scarecrow waked dorothy   lion  toto  told them   ladder  ready the scarecrow climbed up  ladder first but   so awkward  dorothy had  follow close behind  keep him  falling off when  got his head over  top   wall  scarecrow said “oh my” “go on” exclaimed dorothy so  scarecrow climbed farther up  sat down   top   wall  dorothy put her head over  cried “oh my” just   scarecrow had done then toto came up  immediately began  bark but dorothy made him  still the lion climbed  ladder next   tin woodman came last but both  them cried “oh my”  soon  they looked over  wall when they  all sitting   row   top   wall they looked down  saw  strange sight before them   great stretch  country having  floor  smooth  shining  white   bottom   big platter scattered around  many houses made entirely  china  painted   brightest colors these houses  quite small  biggest  them reaching only  high  dorothy’s waist there  also pretty little barns  china fences around them  many cows  sheep  horses  pigs  chickens all made  china  standing about  groups but  strangest  all   people who lived  this queer country there  milkmaids  shepherdesses  brightly colored bodices  golden spots all over their gowns  princesses  most gorgeous frocks  silver  gold  purple  shepherds dressed  knee breeches  pink  yellow  blue stripes down them  golden buckles  their shoes  princes  jeweled crowns upon their heads wearing ermine robes  satin doublets  funny clowns  ruffled gowns  round red spots upon their cheeks  tall pointed caps and strangest  all these people  all made  china even  their clothes   so small   tallest  them  no higher than dorothy’s knee no one did so much  look   travelers  first except one little purple china dog   extralarge head which came   wall  barked  them   tiny voice afterwards running away again “how shall we get down” asked dorothy they found  ladder so heavy they could not pull  up so  scarecrow fell off  wall   others jumped down upon him so   hard floor would not hurt their feet of course they took pains not  light  his head  get  pins  their feet when all  safely down they picked up  scarecrow whose body  quite flattened out  patted his straw into shape again “we must cross this strange place  order  get   other side” said dorothy “for  would  unwise  us  go any other way except due south” they began walking through  country   china people   first thing they came    china milkmaid milking  china cow as they drew near  cow suddenly gave  kick  kicked over  stool  pail  even  milkmaid herself  all fell   china ground   great clatter dorothy  shocked  see   cow had broken her leg off    pail  lying  several small pieces while  poor milkmaid had  nick  her left elbow “there” cried  milkmaid angrily “see what you have done my cow  broken her leg  i must take her   mender’s shop  have  glued  again what do you mean  coming here  frightening my cow” “i’m very sorry” returned dorothy “please forgive us” but  pretty milkmaid  much too vexed  make any answer she picked up  leg sulkily  led her cow away  poor animal limping  three legs as she left them  milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder   clumsy strangers holding her nicked elbow close  her side dorothy  quite grieved  this mishap “we must  very careful here” said  kindhearted woodman “or we may hurt these pretty little people so they  never get over it” a little farther  dorothy met  most beautifully dressed young princess who stopped short  she saw  strangers  started  run away dorothy wanted  see more   princess so she ran after her but  china girl cried out “don’t chase me don’t chase me” she had such  frightened little voice  dorothy stopped  said “why not” “because” answered  princess also stopping  safe distance away “if i run i may fall down  break myself” “but could you not  mended” asked  girl “oh yes but one  never so pretty after being mended you know” replied  princess “i suppose not” said dorothy “now there  mr joker one  our clowns” continued  china lady “who  always trying  stand upon his head he  broken himself so often    mended   hundred places  doesn’t look  all pretty here  comes now so you can see  yourself” indeed  jolly little clown came walking toward them  dorothy could see   spite  his pretty clothes  red  yellow  green   completely covered  cracks running every which way  showing plainly   had been mended  many places the clown put his hands  his pockets  after puffing out his cheeks  nodding his head  them saucily  said “my lady fair why do you stare at poor old mr joker you’re quite  stiff and prim  if you’d eaten up  poker” “be quiet sir” said  princess “can’t you see these  strangers  should  treated  respect” “well that’s respect i expect” declared  clown  immediately stood upon his head “don’t mind mr joker” said  princess  dorothy “he  considerably cracked  his head   makes him foolish” “oh i don’t mind him  bit” said dorothy “but you  so beautiful” she continued “that i am sure i could love you dearly won’t you let me carry you back  kansas  stand you  aunt em’s mantel i could carry you  my basket” “that would make me very unhappy” answered  china princess “you see here  our country we live contentedly  can talk  move around  we please but whenever any  us  taken away our joints  once stiffen  we can only stand straight  look pretty of course   all   expected  us when we   mantels  cabinets  drawingroom tables but our lives  much pleasanter here  our own country” “i would not make you unhappy  all  world” exclaimed dorothy “so i’ll just say goodbye” “goodbye” replied  princess they walked carefully through  china country the little animals  all  people scampered out  their way fearing  strangers would break them  after  hour or so  travelers reached  other side   country  came  another china wall it  not so high   first however   standing upon  lion’s back they all managed  scramble   top then  lion gathered his legs under him  jumped   wall but just   jumped  upset  china church  his tail  smashed  all  pieces “that  too bad” said dorothy “but really i think we  lucky  not doing these little people more harm than breaking  cow’s leg   church they  all so brittle” “they are indeed” said  scarecrow “and i am thankful i am made  straw  cannot  easily damaged there  worse things   world than being  scarecrow” chapter xxi the lion becomes  king  beasts after climbing down   china wall  travelers found themselves   disagreeable country full  bogs  marshes  covered  tall rank grass it  difficult  walk without falling into muddy holes   grass  so thick   hid them  sight however  carefully picking their way they got safely along until they reached solid ground but here  country seemed wilder than ever  after  long  tiresome walk through  underbrush they entered another forest where  trees  bigger  older than any they had ever seen “this forest  perfectly delightful” declared  lion looking around him  joy “never have i seen  more beautiful place” “it seems gloomy” said  scarecrow “not  bit  it” answered  lion “i should like  live here all my life see how soft  dried leaves  under your feet  how rich  green  moss   clings  these old trees surely no wild beast could wish  pleasanter home” “perhaps there  wild beasts   forest now” said dorothy “i suppose there are” returned  lion “but i do not see any  them about” they walked through  forest until  became too dark  go any farther dorothy  toto   lion lay down  sleep while  woodman   scarecrow kept watch over them  usual when morning came they started again before they had gone far they heard  low rumble    growling  many wild animals toto whimpered  little but none   others  frightened  they kept along  welltrodden path until they came   opening   wood  which  gathered hundreds  beasts  every variety there  tigers  elephants  bears  wolves  foxes  all  others   natural history    moment dorothy  afraid but  lion explained   animals  holding  meeting   judged  their snarling  growling  they   great trouble as  spoke several   beasts caught sight  him   once  great assemblage hushed  if  magic the biggest   tigers came up   lion  bowed saying “welcome o king  beasts you have come  good time  fight our enemy  bring peace  all  animals   forest once more” “what  your trouble” asked  lion quietly “we  all threatened” answered  tiger “by  fierce enemy which  lately come into this forest it   most tremendous monster like  great spider   body  big   elephant  legs  long   tree trunk it  eight  these long legs    monster crawls through  forest  seizes  animal   leg  drags   his mouth where  eats    spider does  fly not one  us  safe while this fierce creature  alive  we had called  meeting  decide how  take care  ourselves when you came among us” the lion thought   moment “are there any other lions  this forest”  asked “no there  some but  monster  eaten them all and besides they  none  them nearly so large  brave  you” “if i put  end  your enemy  you bow down  me  obey me  king   forest” inquired  lion “we  do  gladly” returned  tiger  all  other beasts roared   mighty roar “we will” “where  this great spider  yours now” asked  lion “yonder among  oak trees” said  tiger pointing  his forefoot “take good care  these friends  mine” said  lion “and i  go  once  fight  monster” he bade his comrades goodbye  marched proudly away  do battle   enemy the great spider  lying asleep when  lion found him   looked so ugly   foe turned up his nose  disgust its legs  quite  long   tiger had said   body covered  coarse black hair it had  great mouth   row  sharp teeth  foot long but  head  joined   pudgy body   neck  slender   wasp’s waist this gave  lion  hint   best way  attack  creature    knew   easier  fight  asleep than awake  gave  great spring  landed directly upon  monster’s back then  one blow  his heavy paw all armed  sharp claws  knocked  spider’s head   body jumping down  watched  until  long legs stopped wiggling when  knew   quite dead the lion went back   opening where  beasts   forest  waiting  him  said proudly “you need fear your enemy no longer” then  beasts bowed down   lion  their king   promised  come back  rule over them  soon  dorothy  safely  her way  kansas chapter xxii the country   quadlings the four travelers passed through  rest   forest  safety  when they came out   gloom saw before them  steep hill covered  top  bottom  great pieces  rock “that    hard climb” said  scarecrow “but we must get over  hill nevertheless” so  led  way   others followed they had nearly reached  first rock when they heard  rough voice cry out “keep back” “who  you” asked  scarecrow then  head showed itself over  rock   same voice said “this hill belongs  us  we don’t allow anyone  cross it” “but we must cross it” said  scarecrow “we’re going   country   quadlings” “but you shall not” replied  voice  there stepped  behind  rock  strangest man  travelers had ever seen he  quite short  stout  had  big head which  flat   top  supported   thick neck full  wrinkles but  had no arms  all and seeing this  scarecrow did not fear  so helpless  creature could prevent them  climbing  hill so  said “i’m sorry not  do  you wish but we must pass over your hill whether you like  or not”   walked boldly forward as quick  lightning  man’s head shot forward  his neck stretched out until  top   head where   flat struck  scarecrow   middle  sent him tumbling over  over down  hill almost  quickly   came  head went back   body   man laughed harshly   said “it isn’t  easy  you think” a chorus  boisterous laughter came   other rocks  dorothy saw hundreds   armless hammerheads upon  hillside one behind every rock the lion became quite angry   laughter caused   scarecrow’s mishap  giving  loud roar  echoed like thunder  dashed up  hill again  head shot swiftly out   great lion went rolling down  hill  if  had been struck   cannon ball dorothy ran down  helped  scarecrow  his feet   lion came up  her feeling rather bruised  sore  said “it  useless  fight people  shooting heads no one can withstand them” “what can we do then” she asked “call  winged monkeys” suggested  tin woodman “you have still  right  command them once more” “very well” she answered  putting   golden cap she uttered  magic words the monkeys   prompt  ever    few moments  entire band stood before her “what  your commands” inquired  king   monkeys bowing low “carry us over  hill   country   quadlings” answered  girl “it shall  done” said  king   once  winged monkeys caught  four travelers  toto up  their arms  flew away  them as they passed over  hill  hammerheads yelled  vexation  shot their heads high   air but they could not reach  winged monkeys which carried dorothy  her comrades safely over  hill  set them down   beautiful country   quadlings “this   last time you can summon us” said  leader  dorothy “so goodbye  good luck  you” “goodbye  thank you very much” returned  girl   monkeys rose into  air   out  sight   twinkling the country   quadlings seemed rich  happy there  field upon field  ripening grain  wellpaved roads running between  pretty rippling brooks  strong bridges across them the fences  houses  bridges  all painted bright red just  they had been painted yellow   country   winkies  blue   country   munchkins the quadlings themselves who  short  fat  looked chubby  goodnatured  dressed all  red which showed bright against  green grass   yellowing grain the monkeys had set them down near  farmhouse   four travelers walked up    knocked   door it  opened   farmer’s wife  when dorothy asked  something  eat  woman gave them all  good dinner  three kinds  cake  four kinds  cookies   bowl  milk  toto “how far     castle  glinda” asked  child “it  not  great way” answered  farmer’s wife “take  road   south  you  soon reach it” thanking  good woman they started afresh  walked   fields  across  pretty bridges until they saw before them  very beautiful castle before  gates  three young girls dressed  handsome red uniforms trimmed  gold braid   dorothy approached one  them said  her “why have you come   south country” “to see  good witch who rules here” she answered “will you take me  her” “let me have your name  i  ask glinda if she  receive you” they told who they were   girl soldier went into  castle after  few moments she came back  say  dorothy   others    admitted  once chapter xxiii glinda the good witch grants dorothy’s wish before they went  see glinda however they  taken   room   castle where dorothy washed her face  combed her hair   lion shook  dust out  his mane   scarecrow patted himself into his best shape   woodman polished his tin  oiled his joints when they  all quite presentable they followed  soldier girl into  big room where  witch glinda sat upon  throne  rubies she  both beautiful  young  their eyes her hair   rich red  color  fell  flowing ringlets over her shoulders her dress  pure white but her eyes  blue  they looked kindly upon  little girl “what can i do  you my child” she asked dorothy told  witch all her story how  cyclone had brought her   land  oz how she had found her companions    wonderful adventures they had met with “my greatest wish now” she added “is  get back  kansas  aunt em  surely think something dreadful  happened  me    make her put  mourning  unless  crops  better this year than they  last i am sure uncle henry cannot afford it” glinda leaned forward  kissed  sweet upturned face   loving little girl “bless your dear heart” she said “i am sure i can tell you   way  get back  kansas” then she added “but if i do you must give me  golden cap” “willingly” exclaimed dorothy “indeed    no use  me now  when you have  you can command  winged monkeys three times” “and i think i shall need their service just those three times” answered glinda smiling dorothy then gave her  golden cap   witch said   scarecrow “what  you do when dorothy  left us” “i  return   emerald city”  replied “for oz  made me  ruler   people like me the only thing  worries me  how  cross  hill   hammerheads” “by means   golden cap i shall command  winged monkeys  carry you   gates   emerald city” said glinda “for  would   shame  deprive  people  so wonderful  ruler” “am i really wonderful” asked  scarecrow “you  unusual” replied glinda turning   tin woodman she asked “what  become  you when dorothy leaves this country” he leaned  his axe  thought  moment then  said “the winkies  very kind  me  wanted me  rule over them after  wicked witch died i am fond   winkies  if i could get back again   country   west i should like nothing better than  rule over them forever” “my second command   winged monkeys” said glinda “will   they carry you safely   land   winkies your brain may not  so large  look   those   scarecrow but you  really brighter than  is—when you  well polished—and i am sure you  rule  winkies wisely  well” then  witch looked   big shaggy lion  asked “when dorothy  returned  her own home what  become  you” “over  hill   hammerheads”  answered “lies  grand old forest  all  beasts  live there have made me their king if i could only get back  this forest i would pass my life very happily there” “my third command   winged monkeys” said glinda “shall   carry you  your forest then having used up  powers   golden cap i shall give    king   monkeys    his band may thereafter  free  evermore” the scarecrow   tin woodman   lion now thanked  good witch earnestly  her kindness  dorothy exclaimed “you  certainly  good  you  beautiful but you have not yet told me how  get back  kansas” “your silver shoes  carry you over  desert” replied glinda “if you had known their power you could have gone back  your aunt em  very first day you came  this country” “but then i should not have had my wonderful brains” cried  scarecrow “i might have passed my whole life   farmer’s cornfield” “and i should not have had my lovely heart” said  tin woodman “i might have stood  rusted   forest till  end   world” “and i should have lived  coward forever” declared  lion “and no beast  all  forest would have had  good word  say  me” “this  all true” said dorothy “and i am glad i   use  these good friends but now  each  them  had what  most desired  each  happy  having  kingdom  rule besides i think i should like  go back  kansas” “the silver shoes” said  good witch “have wonderful powers and one   most curious things about them   they can carry you  any place   world  three steps  each step   made   wink   eye all you have  do   knock  heels together three times  command  shoes  carry you wherever you wish  go” “if   so” said  child joyfully “i  ask them  carry me back  kansas  once” she threw her arms around  lion’s neck  kissed him patting his big head tenderly then she kissed  tin woodman who  weeping   way most dangerous  his joints but she hugged  soft stuffed body   scarecrow  her arms instead  kissing his painted face  found she  crying herself  this sorrowful parting  her loving comrades glinda  good stepped down  her ruby throne  give  little girl  goodbye kiss  dorothy thanked her  all  kindness she had shown  her friends  herself dorothy now took toto up solemnly  her arms  having said one last goodbye she clapped  heels  her shoes together three times saying “take me home  aunt em” instantly she  whirling through  air so swiftly  all she could see or feel   wind whistling past her ears the silver shoes took but three steps  then she stopped so suddenly  she rolled over upon  grass several times before she knew where she was at length however she sat up  looked about her “good gracious” she cried for she  sitting   broad kansas prairie  just before her   new farmhouse uncle henry built after  cyclone had carried away  old one uncle henry  milking  cows   barnyard  toto had jumped out  her arms   running toward  barn barking furiously dorothy stood up  found she   her stockingfeet for  silver shoes had fallen off  her flight through  air   lost forever   desert chapter xxiv home again aunt em had just come out   house  water  cabbages when she looked up  saw dorothy running toward her “my darling child” she cried folding  little girl  her arms  covering her face  kisses “where   world did you come from” “from  land  oz” said dorothy gravely
