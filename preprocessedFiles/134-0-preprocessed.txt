before arriving  what  termed years  discretion pledged my faith i  treated   world  bound  ever   man whose vices  notorious yet what   vices generally known   various miseries   woman may  subject to which though deeply felt eating into  soul elude description  may  glossed over a false morality  even established which makes all  virtue  women consist  chastity submission   forgiveness  injuries “i pardon my oppressorbitterly  i lament  loss  my child torn  me   most violent manner but nature revolts  my soul sickens   bare supposition   could ever   duty  pretend affection when

positive punishmentswhile no command   husband can prevent  woman  suffering  certain crimes she must  allowed  consult her conscience  regulate her conduct  some degree  her own sense  right the

expence  my peace till he who should have been  guardian laid traps  ensnare me from  moment i believed myself   sight  heaven freeand no power  earth shall force me  renounce my resolution” the judge  summing up  evidence alluded  “the fallacy  letting women plead their feelings   excuse   violation   marriagevow for his part  had always determined  oppose all innovation   newfangled notions which incroached   good old rules  conduct we did not want french principles  public or private lifeand if women  allowed  plead their feelings   excuse or palliation  infidelity   opening  floodgate

and though they might bear  little hard   few very few individuals   evidently   good   whole” conclusion by the editor   ie godwin publisher’s note very few hints exist respecting  plan   remainder   work i find only two detached sentences  some scattered heads   continuation   story i transcribe  whole i “darnford’s letters  affectionate but circumstances occasioned delays   miscarriage  some letters rendered  reception  wishedfor answers doubtful his return  necessary  calm maria’s mind” ii “as darnford had informed her  his business  settled his delaying  return seemed extraordinary but love  excess excludes fear or suspicion” the scattered heads   continuation   story   follow   to understand these minutes   necessary  reader should consider each  them  setting out   same point   story viz  point  which   brought down   preceding chapter godwin’s note i “trial  adulterymaria defends herselfa separation  bed  board   consequenceher fortune  thrown into chancerydarnford obtains  part  his propertymaria goes into  country” ii “a prosecution  adultery commencedtrialdarnford sets out  francelettersonce more pregnanthe returnsmysterious

londonexpects  see her loverthe rack  expectationfinds herself again  childdelighteda discoverya visita miscarriageconclusion” iv “divorced  her husbandher lover unfaithfulpregnancymiscarriagesuicide” the following passage appears  some respects  deviate   preceding hints it  superscribed “the end “she swallowed  laudanum her soul  calmthe tempest had subsidedand nothing remained but  eager longing  forget herselfto fly   anguish she endured  escape  thoughtfrom this hell  disappointment “still her eyes closed notone remembrance  frightful velocity followed anotherall  incidents  her life   arms embodied  assail her  prevent her sinking into  sleep  deathher murdered child again appeared  her mourning   babe  which she   tomb‘and could  have  noblersurely   better  die  me than  enter  life without  mother’s carei cannot livebut could i have deserted my child  moment   bornthrown    troubled wave  life without  hand  support it’she looked up ‘what have i not sufferedmay i find  father where i am goingher head turned  stupor ensued  faintness‘have  little patience’ said maria holding her swimming head she thought  her mother ‘this cannot last long  what   little bodily pain   pangs i have endured’ “a new vision swam before her jemima seemed  enterleading  little creature that  tottering footsteps approached  bed the voice  jemima sounding    distance called hershe tried  listen  speak  look “‘behold your child’ exclaimed jemima maria started off  bed  faintedviolent vomiting followed “when she  restored  life jemima addressed her  great solemnity ‘ led me  suspect  your husband  brother had deceived you  secreted  child i would not torment you  doubtful hopes  i left you at  fatal moment  search   childi snatched her  miseryand now she  alive again would you leave her alone   world  endure what i have endured’ “maria gazed wildly  her her whole frame  convulsed  emotion when  child whom jemima had been tutoring all  journey uttered  word ‘mamma’ she caught her  her bosom  burst into  passion  tearsthen resting  child gently   bed  if afraid  killing itshe put her hand  her eyes  conceal     agonizing struggle  her soul she remained silent  five minutes crossing her arms over her bosom  reclining her headthen exclaimed ‘the conflict  overi  live  my child’” a few readers perhaps  looking over these hints  wonder how  could have been practicable without tediousness or remitting  any degree  interest   story  have filled  these slight sketches  number  pages more considerable than those which have been already presented but  reality these hints simple  they are  pregnant  passion  distress it   refuge  barren authors only  crowd their fictions  so great  number  events   suffer no one  them  sink into  reader’s mind it   province  true genius  develop events  discover their capabilities  ascertain  different passions  sentiments  which they  fraught   diversify them  incidents  give reality   picture  take  hold upon  mind   reader  taste  which they can never  loosened it  particularly  design   author   present instance  make her story subordinate   great moral purpose  “of exhibiting  misery  oppression peculiar  women  arise out   partial laws  customs  societythis view restrained her fancy”  it  necessary  her  place   striking point  view evils   too frequently overlooked   drag into light those details  oppression
