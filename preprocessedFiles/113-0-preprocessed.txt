misselthwaite manor  live  her uncle everybody said she   most disagreeablelooking child ever seen it  true too she had  little thin face   little thin body thin light hair   sour expression her hair  yellow  her face  yellow because she had been born  india  had always been ill  one way or another her father had held  position under  english government  had always been busy  ill himself  her mother had been  great beauty who cared only  go  parties  amuse herself  gay people she had not wanted  little girl  all  when mary  born she handed her over   care   ayah who  made  understand  if she wished  please  mem sahib she must keep  child out  sight  much  possible so when she   sickly fretful ugly little baby she  kept out   way  when she became  sickly fretful toddling thing she  kept out   way also she never remembered seeing familiarly anything but  dark faces  her ayah   other native servants   they always obeyed her  gave her her own way  everything because  mem sahib would  angry if she  disturbed  her crying   time she  six years old she   tyrannical  selfish  little pig  ever lived the young english governess who came  teach her  read  write disliked her so much  she gave up her place  three months  when other governesses came  try  fill  they always went away   shorter time than  first one so if mary had not chosen  really want  know how  read books she would never have learned her letters  all one frightfully hot morning when she  about nine years old she awakened feeling very cross  she became crosser still when she saw   servant who stood  her bedside  not her ayah “why did you come” she said   strange woman “i  not let you stay send my ayah  me” the woman looked frightened but she only stammered   ayah could not come  when mary threw herself into  passion  beat  kicked her she looked only more frightened  repeated    not possible   ayah  come  missie sahib there  something mysterious   air  morning nothing  done   regular order  several   native servants seemed missing while those whom mary saw slunk or hurried about  ashy  scared faces but no one would tell her anything  her ayah did not come she  actually left alone   morning went on   last she wandered out into  garden  began  play  herself under  tree near  veranda she pretended  she  making  flowerbed  she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps  earth all  time growing more  more angry  muttering  herself  things she would say   names she would call saidie when she returned “pig pig daughter  pigs” she said because  call  native  pig   worst insult  all she  grinding her teeth  saying this over  over again when she heard her mother come out   veranda  someone she    fair young man  they stood talking together  low strange voices mary knew  fair young man who looked like  boy she had heard     very young officer who had just come  england the child stared  him but she stared most  her mother she always did this when she had  chance  see her because  mem sahib—mary used  call her  oftener than anything else—was such  tall slim pretty person  wore such lovely clothes her hair  like curly silk  she had  delicate little nose which seemed   disdaining things  she had large laughing eyes all her clothes  thin  floating  mary said they  “full  lace” they looked fuller  lace than ever this morning but her eyes  not laughing  all they  large  scared  lifted imploringly   fair boy officer’s face “is  so very bad oh  it” mary heard her say “awfully”  young man answered   trembling voice “awfully mrs lennox you ought  have gone   hills two weeks ago” the mem sahib wrung her hands “oh i know i ought” she cried “i only stayed  go   silly dinner party what  fool i was” at  very moment such  loud sound  wailing broke out   servants’ quarters  she clutched  young man’s arm  mary stood shivering  head  foot the wailing grew wilder  wilder “what  it what  it” mrs lennox gasped “someone  died” answered  boy officer “you did not say  had broken out among your servants” “i did not know”  mem sahib cried “come  me come  me”  she turned  ran into  house after  appalling things happened   mysteriousness   morning  explained  mary the cholera had broken out   most fatal form  people  dying like flies the ayah had been taken ill   night    because she had just died   servants had wailed   huts before  next day three other servants  dead  others had run away  terror there  panic  every side  dying people  all  bungalows during  confusion  bewilderment   second day mary hid herself   nursery   forgotten  everyone nobody thought  her nobody wanted her  strange things happened  which she knew nothing mary alternately cried  slept through  hours she only knew  people  ill   she heard mysterious  frightening sounds once she crept into  diningroom  found  empty though  partly finished meal    table  chairs  plates looked  if they had been hastily pushed back when  diners rose suddenly  some reason the child ate some fruit  biscuits  being thirsty she drank  glass  wine which stood nearly filled it  sweet  she did not know how strong  was very soon  made her intensely drowsy  she went back  her nursery  shut herself  again frightened  cries she heard   huts    hurrying sound  feet the wine made her so sleepy  she could scarcely keep her eyes open  she lay down  her bed  knew nothing more   long time many things happened during  hours  which she slept so heavily but she  not disturbed   wails   sound  things being carried   out   bungalow when she awakened she lay  stared   wall the house  perfectly still she had never known    so silent before she heard neither voices nor footsteps  wondered if everybody had got well   cholera  all  trouble  over she wondered also who would take care  her now her ayah  dead there would   new ayah  perhaps she would know some new stories mary had been rather tired   old ones she did not cry because her nurse had died she  not  affectionate child  had never cared much  anyone the noise  hurrying about  wailing over  cholera had frightened her  she had been angry because no one seemed  remember  she  alive everyone  too panicstricken  think   little girl no one  fond of when people had  cholera  seemed  they remembered nothing but themselves but if everyone had got well again surely someone would remember  come  look  her but no one came   she lay waiting  house seemed  grow more  more silent she heard something rustling   matting  when she looked down she saw  little snake gliding along  watching her  eyes like jewels she  not frightened because    harmless little thing who would not hurt her   seemed   hurry  get out   room he slipped under  door  she watched him “how queer  quiet  is” she said “it sounds  if there  no one   bungalow but me   snake” almost  next minute she heard footsteps   compound  then   veranda they  men’s footsteps   men entered  bungalow  talked  low voices no one went  meet or speak  them  they seemed  open doors  look into rooms “what desolation” she heard one voice say “that pretty pretty woman i suppose  child too i heard there   child though no one ever saw her” mary  standing   middle   nursery when they opened  door  few minutes later she looked  ugly cross little thing   frowning because she  beginning   hungry  feel disgracefully neglected the first man who came    large officer she had once seen talking  her father he looked tired  troubled but when  saw her   so startled   almost jumped back “barney”  cried out “there   child here a child alone in  place like this mercy  us who  she” “i am mary lennox”  little girl said drawing herself up stiffly she thought  man  very rude  call her father’s bungalow “a place like this” “i fell asleep when everyone had  cholera  i have only just wakened up why does nobody come” “it   child no one ever saw” exclaimed  man turning  his companions “she  actually been forgotten” “why  i forgotten” mary said stamping her foot “why does nobody come” the young man whose name  barney looked  her very sadly mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes  if  wink tears away “poor little kid”  said “there  nobody left  come” it    strange  sudden way  mary found out  she had neither father nor mother left  they had died  been carried away   night    few native servants who had not died also had left  house  quickly  they could get out  it none  them even remembering  there   missie sahib that  why  place  so quiet it  true  there  no one   bungalow but herself   little rustling snake chapter ii mistress mary quite contrary mary had liked  look  her mother   distance  she had thought her very pretty but  she knew very little  her she could scarcely have been expected  love her or  miss her very much when she  gone she did not miss her  all  fact   she   selfabsorbed child she gave her entire thought  herself  she had always done if she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious  being left alone   world but she  very young   she had always been taken care of she supposed she always would be what she thought   she would like  know if she  going  nice people who would  polite  her  give her her own way  her ayah   other native servants had done she knew  she  not going  stay   english clergyman’s house where she  taken  first she did not want  stay the english clergyman  poor   had five children nearly all  same age  they wore shabby clothes   always quarreling  snatching toys  each other mary hated their untidy bungalow   so disagreeable  them  after  first day or two nobody would play  her by  second day they had given her  nickname which made her furious it  basil who thought   first basil   little boy  impudent blue eyes   turnedup nose  mary hated him she  playing  herself under  tree just  she had been playing  day  cholera broke out she  making heaps  earth  paths   garden  basil came  stood near  watch her presently  got rather interested  suddenly made  suggestion “why don’t you put  heap  stones there  pretend    rockery”  said “there   middle”   leaned over her  point “go away” cried mary “i don’t want boys go away” for  moment basil looked angry  then  began  tease he  always teasing his sisters he danced round  round her  made faces  sang  laughed “mistress mary quite contrary how does your garden grow with silver bells  cockle shells and marigolds all   row” he sang  until  other children heard  laughed too   crosser mary got  more they sang “mistress mary quite contrary”  after   long  she stayed  them they called her “mistress mary quite contrary” when they spoke  her  each other  often when they spoke  her “you  going   sent home” basil said  her “at  end   week and we’re glad  it” “i am glad  it too” answered mary “where  home” “she doesn’t know where home is” said basil  sevenyearold scorn “it’s england  course our grandmama lives there  our sister mabel  sent  her last year you  not going  your grandmama you have none you  going  your uncle his name  mr archibald craven” “i don’t know anything about him” snapped mary “i know you don’t” basil answered “you don’t know anything girls never do i heard father  mother talking about him he lives   great big desolate old house   country  no one goes near him he’s so cross  won’t let them  they wouldn’t come if  would let them he’s  hunchback  he’s horrid” “i don’t believe you” said mary  she turned her back  stuck her fingers  her ears because she would not listen any more but she thought over   great deal afterward  when mrs crawford told her  night  she  going  sail away  england   few days  go  her uncle mr archibald craven who lived  misselthwaite manor she looked so stony  stubbornly uninterested  they did not know what  think about her they tried   kind  her but she only turned her face away when mrs crawford attempted  kiss her  held herself stiffly when mr crawford patted her shoulder “she  such  plain child” mrs crawford said pityingly afterward “and her mother  such  pretty creature she had  very pretty manner too  mary   most unattractive ways i ever saw   child the children call her ‘mistress mary quite contrary’  though it’s naughty  them one can’t help understanding it” “perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face  her pretty manners oftener into  nursery mary might have learned some pretty ways too it  very sad now  poor beautiful thing  gone  remember  many people never even knew  she had  child  all” “i believe she scarcely ever looked  her” sighed mrs crawford “when her ayah  dead there  no one  give  thought   little thing think   servants running away  leaving her all alone   deserted bungalow colonel mcgrew said  nearly jumped out  his skin when  opened  door  found her standing  herself   middle   room” mary made  long voyage  england under  care   officer’s wife who  taking her children  leave them   boardingschool she  very much absorbed  her own little boy  girl   rather glad  hand  child over   woman mr archibald craven sent  meet her  london the woman  his housekeeper  misselthwaite manor  her name  mrs medlock she   stout woman  very red cheeks  sharp black eyes she wore  very purple dress  black silk mantle  jet fringe     black bonnet  purple velvet flowers which stuck up  trembled when she moved her head mary did not like her  all but  she very seldom liked people there  nothing remarkable  that besides which   very evident mrs medlock did not think much  her “my word she’s  plain little piece  goods” she said “and we’d heard  her mother   beauty she hasn’t handed much   down  she ma’am” “perhaps she  improve  she grows older”  officer’s wife said goodnaturedly “if she  not so sallow  had  nicer expression her features  rather good children alter so much” “she’ll have  alter  good deal” answered mrs medlock “and there’s nothing likely  improve children  misselthwaite—if you ask me” they thought mary  not listening because she  standing  little apart  them   window   private hotel they had gone to she  watching  passing buses  cabs  people but she heard quite well   made very curious about her uncle   place  lived in what sort   place  it  what would   like what   hunchback she had never seen one perhaps there  none  india since she had been living  other people’s houses  had had no ayah she had begun  feel lonely   think queer thoughts which  new  her she had begun  wonder why she had never seemed  belong  anyone even when her father  mother had been alive other children seemed  belong  their fathers  mothers but she had never seemed  really  anyone’s little girl she had had servants  food  clothes but no one had taken any notice  her she did not know  this  because she   disagreeable child but then  course she did not know she  disagreeable she often thought  other people were but she did not know  she  so herself she thought mrs medlock  most disagreeable person she had ever seen  her common highly colored face  her common fine bonnet when  next day they set out  their journey  yorkshire she walked through  station   railway carriage  her head up  trying  keep  far away  her  she could because she did not want  seem  belong  her it would have made her angry  think people imagined she  her little girl but mrs medlock  not   least disturbed  her  her thoughts she   kind  woman who would “stand no nonsense  young ones” at least   what she would have said if she had been asked she had not wanted  go  london just when her sister maria’s daughter  going   married but she had  comfortable well paid place  housekeeper  misselthwaite manor   only way  which she could keep    do  once what mr archibald craven told her  do she never dared even  ask  question “captain lennox  his wife died   cholera” mr craven had said  his short cold way “captain lennox  my wife’s brother  i am their daughter’s guardian the child    brought here you must go  london  bring her yourself” so she packed her small trunk  made  journey mary sat  her corner   railway carriage  looked plain  fretful she had nothing  read or  look at  she had folded her thin little blackgloved hands  her lap her black dress made her look yellower than ever  her limp light hair straggled  under her black crêpe hat “a more marredlooking young one i never saw  my life” mrs medlock thought marred   yorkshire word  means spoiled  pettish she had never seen  child who sat so still without doing anything   last she got tired  watching her  began  talk   brisk hard voice “i suppose i may  well tell you something about where you  going to” she said “do you know anything about your uncle” “no” said mary “never heard your father  mother talk about him” “no” said mary frowning she frowned because she remembered  her father  mother had never talked  her about anything  particular certainly they had never told her things “humph” muttered mrs medlock staring  her queer unresponsive little face she did not say any more   few moments  then she began again “i suppose you might  well  told something—to prepare you you  going   queer place” mary said nothing  all  mrs medlock looked rather discomfited  her apparent indifference but after taking  breath she went on “not but  it’s  grand big place   gloomy way  mr craven’s proud    his way—and that’s gloomy enough too the house  six hundred years old  it’s   edge   moor  there’s near  hundred rooms  it though most  them’s shut up  locked and there’s pictures  fine old furniture  things that’s been there  ages  there’s  big park round   gardens  trees  branches trailing   ground—some  them” she paused  took another breath “but there’s nothing else” she ended suddenly mary had begun  listen  spite  herself it all sounded so unlike india  anything new rather attracted her but she did not intend  look  if she  interested that  one  her unhappy disagreeable ways so she sat still “well” said mrs medlock “what do you think  it” “nothing” she answered “i know nothing about such places” that made mrs medlock laugh  short sort  laugh “eh” she said “but you  like  old woman don’t you care” “it doesn’t matter” said mary “whether i care or not” “you  right enough there” said mrs medlock “it doesn’t what you’re   kept  misselthwaite manor  i don’t know unless because it’s  easiest way he’s not going  trouble himself about you that’s sure  certain he never troubles himself about no one” she stopped herself  if she had just remembered something  time “he’s got  crooked back” she said “that set him wrong he   sour young man  got no good  all his money  big place till   married” mary’s eyes turned toward her  spite  her intention not  seem  care she had never thought   hunchback’s being married  she   trifle surprised mrs medlock saw this   she   talkative woman she continued  more interest this  one way  passing some   time  any rate “she   sweet pretty thing  he’d have walked  world over  get her  blade o’ grass she wanted nobody thought she’d marry him but she did  people said she married him  his money but she didn’t—she didn’t” positively “when she died—” mary gave  little involuntary jump “oh did she die” she exclaimed quite without meaning to she had just remembered  french fairy story she had once read called “riquet à la houppe” it had been about  poor hunchback   beautiful princess   had made her suddenly sorry  mr archibald craven “yes she died” mrs medlock answered “and  made him queerer than ever he cares about nobody he won’t see people most   time  goes away  when    misselthwaite  shuts himself up   west wing  won’t let anyone but pitcher see him pitcher’s  old fellow but  took care  him when    child   knows his ways” it sounded like something   book   did not make mary feel cheerful a house   hundred rooms nearly all shut up   their doors locked—a house   edge   moor—whatsoever  moor was—sounded dreary a man   crooked back who shut himself up also she stared out   window  her lips pinched together   seemed quite natural   rain should have begun  pour down  gray slanting lines  splash  stream down  windowpanes if  pretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful  being something like her own mother   running   out  going  parties  she had done  frocks “full  lace” but she  not there any more “you needn’t expect  see him because ten  one you won’t” said mrs medlock “and you mustn’t expect  there   people  talk  you you’ll have  play about  look after yourself you’ll  told what rooms you can go into  what rooms you’re  keep out of there’s gardens enough but when you’re   house don’t go wandering  poking about mr craven won’t have it” “i shall not want  go poking about” said sour little mary  just  suddenly  she had begun   rather sorry  mr archibald craven she began  cease   sorry   think   unpleasant enough  deserve all  had happened  him and she turned her face toward  streaming panes   window   railway carriage  gazed out   gray rainstorm which looked  if  would go  forever  ever she watched  so long  steadily   grayness grew heavier  heavier before her eyes  she fell asleep chapter iii across the moor she slept  long time  when she awakened mrs medlock had bought  lunchbasket  one   stations  they had some chicken  cold beef  bread  butter  some hot tea the rain seemed   streaming down more heavily than ever  everybody   station wore wet  glistening waterproofs the guard lighted  lamps   carriage  mrs medlock cheered up very much over her tea  chicken  beef she ate  great deal  afterward fell asleep herself  mary sat  stared  her  watched her fine bonnet slip  one side until she herself fell asleep once more   corner   carriage lulled   splashing   rain against  windows it  quite dark when she awakened again the train had stopped   station  mrs medlock  shaking her “you have had  sleep” she said “it’s time  open your eyes we’re  thwaite station  we’ve got  long drive before us” mary stood up  tried  keep her eyes open while mrs medlock collected her parcels the little girl did not offer  help her because  india native servants always picked up or carried things   seemed quite proper  other people should wait  one the station   small one  nobody but themselves seemed   getting out   train the stationmaster spoke  mrs medlock   rough goodnatured way pronouncing his words   queer broad fashion which mary found out afterward  yorkshire “i see tha’s got back”  said “an’ tha’s browt th’ young ’un  thee” “aye that’s her” answered mrs medlock speaking   yorkshire accent herself  jerking her head over her shoulder toward mary “how’s thy missus” “well enow th’ carriage  waitin’ outside  thee” a brougham stood   road before  little outside platform mary saw     smart carriage      smart footman who helped her in his long waterproof coat   waterproof covering  his hat  shining  dripping  rain  everything was  burly stationmaster included when  shut  door mounted  box   coachman  they drove off  little girl found herself seated   comfortably cushioned corner but she  not inclined  go  sleep again she sat  looked out   window curious  see something   road over which she  being driven   queer place mrs medlock had spoken of she  not  all  timid child  she  not exactly frightened but she felt  there  no knowing what might happen   house   hundred rooms nearly all shut up—a house standing   edge   moor “what   moor” she said suddenly  mrs medlock “look out   window  about ten minutes  you’ll see”  woman answered “we’ve got  drive five miles across missel moor before we get   manor you won’t see much because it’s  dark night but you can see something” mary asked no more questions but waited   darkness  her corner keeping her eyes   window the carriage lamps cast rays  light  little distance ahead  them  she caught glimpses   things they passed after they had left  station they had driven through  tiny village  she had seen whitewashed cottages   lights   public house then they had passed  church   vicarage   little shopwindow or so   cottage  toys  sweets  odd things set out  sale then they    highroad  she saw hedges  trees after  there seemed nothing different   long time—or  least  seemed  long time  her at last  horses began  go more slowly  if they  climbing uphill  presently there seemed   no more hedges  no more trees she could see nothing  fact but  dense darkness  either side she leaned forward  pressed her face against  window just   carriage gave  big jolt “eh we’re   moor now sure enough” said mrs medlock the carriage lamps shed  yellow light   roughlooking road which seemed   cut through bushes  lowgrowing things which ended   great expanse  dark apparently spread out before  around them a wind  rising  making  singular wild low rushing sound “it’s—it’s not  sea  it” said mary looking round  her companion “no not it” answered mrs medlock “nor  isn’t fields nor mountains it’s just miles  miles  miles  wild land  nothing grows  but heather  gorse  broom  nothing lives  but wild ponies  sheep” “i feel  if  might   sea if there  water  it” said mary “it sounds like  sea just now” “that’s  wind blowing through  bushes” mrs medlock said “it’s  wild dreary enough place  my mind though there’s plenty  likes it—particularly when  heather’s  bloom” on   they drove through  darkness  though  rain stopped  wind rushed   whistled  made strange sounds the road went up  down  several times  carriage passed over  little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast   great deal  noise mary felt  if  drive would never come   end    wide bleak moor   wide expanse  black ocean through which she  passing   strip  dry land “i don’t like it” she said  herself “i don’t like it”  she pinched her thin lips more tightly together the horses  climbing up  hilly piece  road when she first caught sight   light mrs medlock saw   soon  she did  drew  long sigh  relief “eh i am glad  see  bit o’ light twinkling” she exclaimed “it’s  light   lodge window we shall get  good cup  tea after  bit  all events” it  “after  bit”  she said  when  carriage passed through  park gates there  still two miles  avenue  drive through   trees which nearly met overhead made  seem  if they  driving through  long dark vault they drove out   vault into  clear space  stopped before  immensely long but lowbuilt house which seemed  ramble round  stone court at first mary thought  there  no lights  all   windows but  she got out   carriage she saw  one room   corner upstairs showed  dull glow the entrance door   huge one made  massive curiously shaped panels  oak studded  big iron nails  bound  great iron bars it opened into  enormous hall which  so dimly lighted   faces   portraits   walls   figures   suits  armor made mary feel  she did not want  look  them as she stood   stone floor she looked  very small odd little black figure  she felt  small  lost  odd  she looked a neat thin old man stood near  manservant who opened  door  them “you   take her  her room”  said   husky voice “he doesn’t want  see her he’s going  london   morning” “very well mr pitcher” mrs medlock answered “so long  i know what’s expected  me i can manage” “what’s expected  you mrs medlock” mr pitcher said “is  you make sure  he’s not disturbed    doesn’t see what  doesn’t want  see” and then mary lennox  led up  broad staircase  down  long corridor  up  short flight  steps  through another corridor  another until  door opened   wall  she found herself   room   fire     supper   table mrs medlock said unceremoniously “well here you are this room   next  where you’ll live—and you must keep  them don’t you forget that” it   this way mistress mary arrived  misselthwaite manor  she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary  all her life chapter iv martha when she opened her eyes   morning   because  young housemaid had come into her room  light  fire   kneeling   hearthrug raking out  cinders noisily mary lay  watched her   few moments  then began  look about  room she had never seen  room  all like   thought  curious  gloomy the walls  covered  tapestry   forest scene embroidered  it there  fantastically dressed people under  trees    distance there   glimpse   turrets   castle there  hunters  horses  dogs  ladies mary felt  if she    forest  them out   deep window she could see  great climbing stretch  land which seemed  have no trees  it   look rather like  endless dull purplish sea “what  that” she said pointing out   window martha  young housemaid who had just risen  her feet looked  pointed also “that there” she said “yes” “that’s th’ moor”   goodnatured grin “does tha’ like it” “no” answered mary “i hate it” “that’s because tha’rt not used  it” martha said going back  her hearth “tha’ thinks it’s too big an’ bare now but tha’  like it” “do you” inquired mary “aye  i do” answered martha cheerfully polishing away   grate “i just love it it’s none bare it’s covered wi’ growin’ things  smells sweet it’s fair lovely  spring an’ summer when th’ gorse an’ broom an’ heather’s  flower it smells o’ honey an’ there’s such  lot o’ fresh air—an’ th’ sky looks so high an’ th’ bees an’ skylarks makes such  nice noise hummin’ an’ singin’ eh i wouldn’t live away  th’ moor  anythin’” mary listened  her   grave puzzled expression the native servants she had been used   india  not   least like this they  obsequious  servile  did not presume  talk  their masters  if they  their equals they made salaams  called them “protector   poor”  names   sort indian servants  commanded  do things not asked it  not  custom  say “please”  “thank you”  mary had always slapped her ayah   face when she  angry she wondered  little what this girl would do if one slapped her   face she   round rosy goodnatured looking creature but she had  sturdy way which made mistress mary wonder if she might not even slap back—if  person who slapped her  only  little girl “you   strange servant” she said  her pillows rather haughtily martha sat up  her heels  her blackingbrush  her hand  laughed without seeming  least out  temper “eh i know that” she said “if there   grand missus  misselthwaite i should never have been even one  th’ under housemaids i might have been let   scullerymaid but i’d never have been let upstairs i’m too common an’ i talk too much yorkshire but this   funny house  all it’s so grand seems like there’s neither master nor mistress except mr pitcher an’ mrs medlock mr craven  won’t  troubled about anythin’ when he’s here an’ he’s nearly always away mrs medlock gave me th’ place out o’ kindness she told me she could never have done  if misselthwaite had been like other big houses” “are you going   my servant” mary asked still  her imperious little indian way martha began  rub her grate again “i’m mrs medlock’s servant” she said stoutly “an’ she’s mr craven’s—but i’m  do  housemaid’s work up here an’ wait  you  bit but you won’t need much waitin’ on” “who  going  dress me” demanded mary martha sat up  her heels again  stared she spoke  broad yorkshire  her amazement “canna’ tha’ dress thysen” she said “what do you mean i don’t understand your language” said mary “eh i forgot” martha said “mrs medlock told me i’d have   careful or you wouldn’t know what i  sayin’ i mean can’t you put  your own clothes” “no” answered mary quite indignantly “i never did  my life my ayah dressed me  course” “well” said martha evidently not   least aware  she  impudent “it’s time tha’ should learn tha’ cannot begin younger it’ll do thee good  wait  thysen  bit my mother always said she couldn’t see why grand people’s children didn’t turn out fair fools—what  nurses an’ bein’ washed an’ dressed an’ took out  walk  if they  puppies” “it  different  india” said mistress mary disdainfully she could scarcely stand this but martha  not  all crushed “eh i can see it’s different” she answered almost sympathetically “i dare say it’s because there’s such  lot o’ blacks there instead o’ respectable white people when i heard you  comin’  india i thought you   black too” mary sat up  bed furious “what” she said “what you thought i   native you—you daughter   pig” martha stared  looked hot “who  you callin’ names” she said “you needn’t  so vexed that’s not th’ way   young lady  talk i’ve nothin’ against th’ blacks when you read about ’em  tracts they’re always very religious you always read   black’s  man an’  brother i’ve never seen  black an’ i  fair pleased  think i  goin’  see one close when i come   light your fire this mornin’ i crep’ up  your bed an’ pulled th’ cover back careful  look  you an’ there you was” disappointedly “no more black than me—for all you’re so yeller” mary did not even try  control her rage  humiliation “you thought i   native you dared you don’t know anything about natives they  not people—they’re servants who must salaam  you you know nothing about india you know nothing about anything” she   such  rage  felt so helpless before  girl’s simple stare  somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely  far away  everything she understood  which understood her  she threw herself face downward   pillows  burst into passionate sobbing she sobbed so unrestrainedly  goodnatured yorkshire martha   little frightened  quite sorry  her she went   bed  bent over her “eh you mustn’t cry like  there” she begged “you mustn’t  sure i didn’t know you’d  vexed i don’t know anythin’ about anythin’—just like you said i beg your pardon miss do stop cryin’” there  something comforting  really friendly  her queer yorkshire speech  sturdy way which had  good effect  mary she gradually ceased crying  became quiet martha looked relieved “it’s time  thee  get up now” she said “mrs medlock said i   carry tha’ breakfast an’ tea an’ dinner into th’ room next  this it’s been made into  nursery  thee i’ll help thee   thy clothes if tha’ll get out o’ bed if th’ buttons   th’ back tha’ cannot button them up tha’self” when mary  last decided  get up  clothes martha took   wardrobe  not  ones she had worn when she arrived  night before  mrs medlock “those  not mine” she said “mine  black” she looked  thick white wool coat  dress over  added  cool approval “those  nicer than mine” “these  th’ ones tha’ must put on” martha answered “mr craven ordered mrs medlock  get ’em  london he said ‘i won’t have  child dressed  black wanderin’ about like  lost soul’  said ‘it’d make  place sadder than  is put color  her’ mother she said she knew what  meant mother always knows what  body means she doesn’t hold  black hersel’” “i hate black things” said mary the dressing process  one which taught them both something martha had “buttoned up” her little sisters  brothers but she had never seen  child who stood still  waited  another person  do things  her  if she had neither hands nor feet  her own “why doesn’t tha’ put  tha’ own shoes” she said when mary quietly held out her foot “my ayah did it” answered mary staring “it   custom” she said  very often—“it   custom” the native servants  always saying it if one told them  do  thing their ancestors had not done   thousand years they gazed  one mildly  said “it  not  custom”  one knew    end   matter it had not been  custom  mistress mary should do anything but stand  allow herself   dressed like  doll but before she  ready  breakfast she began  suspect  her life  misselthwaite manor would end  teaching her  number  things quite new  her—things such  putting  her own shoes  stockings  picking up things she let fall if martha had been  welltrained fine young lady’s maid she would have been more subservient  respectful  would have known    her business  brush hair  button boots  pick things up  lay them away she was however only  untrained yorkshire rustic who had been brought up   moorland cottage   swarm  little brothers  sisters who had never dreamed  doing anything but waiting  themselves    younger ones who  either babies  arms or just learning  totter about  tumble over things if mary lennox had been  child who  ready   amused she would perhaps have laughed  martha’s readiness  talk but mary only listened  her coldly  wondered  her freedom  manner at first she  not  all interested but gradually   girl rattled   her goodtempered homely way mary began  notice what she  saying “eh you should see ’em all” she said “there’s twelve  us an’ my father only gets sixteen shilling  week i can tell you my mother’s put    get porridge  ’em all they tumble about  th’ moor an’ play there all day an’ mother says th’ air  th’ moor fattens ’em she says she believes they eat th’ grass same  th’ wild ponies do our dickon he’s twelve years old  he’s got  young pony  calls his own” “where did  get it” asked mary “he found   th’ moor   mother when    little one an’  began  make friends   an’ give  bits o’ bread an’ pluck young grass  it and  got  like him so  follows him about an’  lets him get   back dickon’s  kind lad an’ animals likes him” mary had never possessed  animal pet  her own  had always thought she should like one so she began  feel  slight interest  dickon   she had never before been interested  anyone but herself    dawning   healthy sentiment when she went into  room which had been made into  nursery  her she found    rather like  one she had slept in it  not  child’s room but  grownup person’s room  gloomy old pictures   walls  heavy old oak chairs a table   center  set   good substantial breakfast but she had always had  very small appetite  she looked  something more than indifference   first plate martha set before her “i don’t want it” she said “tha’ doesn’t want thy porridge” martha exclaimed incredulously “no” “tha’ doesn’t know how good  is put  bit o’ treacle   or  bit o’ sugar” “i don’t want it” repeated mary “eh” said martha “i can’t abide  see good victuals go  waste if our children   this table they’d clean  bare  five minutes” “why” said mary coldly “why” echoed martha “because they scarce ever had their stomachs full  their lives they’re  hungry  young hawks an’ foxes” “i don’t know what     hungry” said mary   indifference  ignorance martha looked indignant “well  would do thee good  try it i can see  plain enough” she said outspokenly “i’ve no patience  folk  sits an’ just stares  good bread an’ meat my word don’t i wish dickon  phil an’ jane an’ th’ rest  ’em had what’s here under their pinafores” “why don’t you take   them” suggested mary “it’s not mine” answered martha stoutly “an’ this isn’t my day out i get my day out once  month same  th’ rest then i go home an’ clean up  mother an’ give her  day’s rest” mary drank some tea  ate  little toast  some marmalade “you wrap up warm an’ run out an’ play you” said martha “it’ll do you good  give you some stomach  your meat” mary went   window there  gardens  paths  big trees but everything looked dull  wintry “out why should i go out   day like this” “well if tha’ doesn’t go out tha’lt have  stay in an’ what  tha’ got  do” mary glanced about her there  nothing  do when mrs medlock had prepared  nursery she had not thought  amusement perhaps  would  better  go  see what  gardens  like “who  go  me” she inquired martha stared “you’ll go  yourself” she answered “you’ll have  learn  play like other children does when they haven’t got sisters  brothers our dickon goes off  th’ moor  himself an’ plays  hours that’s how  made friends  th’ pony he’s got sheep  th’ moor  knows him an’ birds  comes an’ eats out  his hand however little there   eat  always saves  bit o’ his bread  coax his pets” it  really this mention  dickon which made mary decide  go out though she  not aware  it there would be birds outside though there would not  ponies or sheep they would  different   birds  india   might amuse her  look  them martha found her coat  hat  her   pair  stout little boots  she showed her her way downstairs “if tha’ goes round  way tha’ll come  th’ gardens” she said pointing   gate   wall  shrubbery “there’s lots o’ flowers  summertime but there’s nothin’ bloomin’ now” she seemed  hesitate  second before she added “one  th’ gardens  locked up no one  been    ten years” “why” asked mary  spite  herself here  another locked door added   hundred   strange house “mr craven had  shut when his wife died so sudden he won’t let no one go inside it  her garden he locked th’ door an’ dug  hole  buried th’ key there’s mrs medlock’s bell ringing—i must run” after she  gone mary turned down  walk which led   door   shrubbery she could not help thinking about  garden which no one had been into  ten years she wondered what  would look like  whether there  any flowers still alive  it when she had passed through  shrubbery gate she found herself  great gardens  wide lawns  winding walks  clipped borders there  trees  flowerbeds  evergreens clipped into strange shapes   large pool   old gray fountain   midst but  flowerbeds  bare  wintry   fountain  not playing this  not  garden which  shut up how could  garden  shut up you could always walk into  garden she  just thinking this when she saw that   end   path she  following there seemed    long wall  ivy growing over it she  not familiar enough  england  know  she  coming upon  kitchengardens where  vegetables  fruit  growing she went toward  wall  found  there   green door   ivy    stood open this  not  closed garden evidently  she could go into it she went through  door  found     garden  walls all round      only one  several walled gardens which seemed  open into one another she saw another open green door revealing bushes  pathways between beds containing winter vegetables fruittrees  trained flat against  wall  over some   beds there  glass frames the place  bare  ugly enough mary thought  she stood  stared about her it might  nicer  summer when things  green but there  nothing pretty about  now presently  old man   spade over his shoulder walked through  door leading   second garden he looked startled when  saw mary  then touched his cap he had  surly old face  did not seem  all pleased  see her—but then she  displeased  his garden  wore her “quite contrary” expression  certainly did not seem  all pleased  see him “what  this place” she asked “one o’ th’ kitchengardens”  answered “what  that” said mary pointing through  other green door “another  ’em” shortly “there’s another  t’other side o’ th’ wall an’ there’s th’ orchard t’other side o’ that” “can i go  them” asked mary “if tha’ likes but there’s nowt  see” mary made no response she went down  path  through  second green door there she found more walls  winter vegetables  glass frames but   second wall there  another green door    not open perhaps  led into  garden which no one had seen  ten years as she  not  all  timid child  always did what she wanted  do mary went   green door  turned  handle she hoped  door would not open because she wanted   sure she had found  mysterious garden—but  did open quite easily  she walked through   found herself   orchard there  walls all round  also  trees trained against them  there  bare fruittrees growing   winterbrowned grass—but there  no green door   seen anywhere mary looked  it  yet when she had entered  upper end   garden she had noticed   wall did not seem  end   orchard but  extend beyond   if  enclosed  place   other side she could see  tops  trees above  wall  when she stood still she saw  bird   bright red breast sitting   topmost branch  one  them  suddenly  burst into his winter song—almost  if  had caught sight  her   calling  her she stopped  listened  him  somehow his cheerful friendly little whistle gave her  pleased feeling—even  disagreeable little girl may  lonely   big closed house  big bare moor  big bare gardens had made this one feel  if there  no one left   world but herself if she had been  affectionate child who had been used  being loved she would have broken her heart but even though she  “mistress mary quite contrary” she  desolate   brightbreasted little bird brought  look into her sour little face which  almost  smile she listened  him until  flew away he  not like  indian bird  she liked him  wondered if she should ever see him again perhaps  lived   mysterious garden  knew all about it perhaps   because she had nothing whatever  do  she thought so much   deserted garden she  curious about   wanted  see what   like why had mr archibald craven buried  key if  had liked his wife so much why did  hate her garden she wondered if she should ever see him but she knew  if she did she should not like him   would not like her   she should only stand  stare  him  say nothing though she should  wanting dreadfully  ask him why  had done such  queer thing “people never like me  i never like people” she thought “and i never can talk   crawford children could they  always talking  laughing  making noises” she thought   robin    way  seemed  sing his song  her   she remembered  treetop  perched  she stopped rather suddenly   path “i believe  tree    secret garden—i feel sure  was” she said “there   wall round  place  there  no door” she walked back into  first kitchengarden she had entered  found  old man digging there she went  stood beside him  watched him  few moments  her cold little way he took no notice  her  so  last she spoke  him “i have been into  other gardens” she said “there  nothin’  prevent thee”  answered crustily “i went into  orchard” “there  no dog  th’ door  bite thee”  answered “there  no door there into  other garden” said mary “what garden”  said   rough voice stopping his digging   moment “the one   other side   wall” answered mistress mary “there  trees there—i saw  tops  them a bird   red breast  sitting  one  them   sang” to her surprise  surly old weatherbeaten face actually changed  expression a slow smile spread over    gardener looked quite different it made her think    curious how much nicer  person looked when  smiled she had not thought   before he turned about   orchard side  his garden  began  whistle—a low soft whistle she could not understand how such  surly man could make such  coaxing sound almost  next moment  wonderful thing happened she heard  soft little rushing flight through  air—and    bird   red breast flying  them   actually alighted   big clod  earth quite near   gardener’s foot “here  is” chuckled  old man  then  spoke   bird  if   speaking   child “where  tha’ been tha’ cheeky little beggar”  said “i’ve not seen thee before today has tha begun tha’ courtin’ this early  th’ season tha’rt too forrad” the bird put his tiny head  one side  looked up  him  his soft bright eye which  like  black dewdrop he seemed quite familiar  not  least afraid he hopped about  pecked  earth briskly looking  seeds  insects it actually gave mary  queer feeling  her heart because   so pretty  cheerful  seemed so like  person he had  tiny plump body   delicate beak  slender delicate legs “will  always come when you call him” she asked almost   whisper “aye   will i’ve knowed him ever since    fledgling he come out  th’ nest  th’ other garden an’ when first  flew over th’ wall   too weak  fly back   few days an’ we got friendly when  went over th’ wall again th’ rest  th’ brood  gone an’   lonely an’  come back  me” “what kind   bird  he” mary asked “doesn’t tha’ know he’s  robin redbreast an’ they’re th’ friendliest curiousest birds alive they’re almost  friendly  dogs—if you know how  get   ’em watch him peckin’ about there an’ lookin’ round  us now an’ again he knows we’re talkin’ about him” it   queerest thing   world  see  old fellow he looked   plump little scarletwaistcoated bird  if   both proud  fond  him “he’s  conceited one”  chuckled “he likes  hear folk talk about him an’ curious—bless me there never  his like  curiosity an’ meddlin’ he’s always comin’  see what i’m plantin’ he knows all th’ things mester craven never troubles hissel’  find out he’s th’ head gardener  is” the robin hopped about busily pecking  soil  now  then stopped  looked  them  little mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed  her  great curiosity it really seemed  if   finding out all about her the queer feeling  her heart increased “where did  rest   brood fly to” she asked “there’s no knowin’ the old ones turn ’em out o’ their nest an’ make ’em fly an’ they’re scattered before you know it this one   knowin’ one an’  knew   lonely” mistress mary went  step nearer   robin  looked  him very hard “i’m lonely” she said she had not known before  this  one   things which made her feel sour  cross she seemed  find  out when  robin looked  her  she looked   robin the old gardener pushed his cap back  his bald head  stared  her  minute “art tha’ th’ little wench  india”  asked mary nodded “then no wonder tha’rt lonely tha’lt  lonlier before tha’s done”  said he began  dig again driving his spade deep into  rich black garden soil while  robin hopped about very busily employed “what  your name” mary inquired he stood up  answer her “ben weatherstaff”  answered  then  added   surly chuckle “i’m lonely mysel’ except when he’s  me”   jerked his thumb toward  robin “he’s th’ only friend i’ve got” “i have no friends  all” said mary “i never had my ayah didn’t like me  i never played  anyone” it   yorkshire habit  say what you think  blunt frankness  old ben weatherstaff   yorkshire moor man “tha’ an’ me   good bit alike”  said “we  wove out  th’ same cloth we’re neither  us good lookin’ an’ we’re both  us  sour  we look we’ve got  same nasty tempers both  us i’ll warrant” this  plain speaking  mary lennox had never heard  truth about herself  her life native servants always salaamed  submitted  you whatever you did she had never thought much about her looks but she wondered if she   unattractive  ben weatherstaff  she also wondered if she looked  sour   had looked before  robin came she actually began  wonder also if she  “nasty tempered” she felt uncomfortable suddenly  clear rippling little sound broke out near her  she turned round she  standing  few feet   young appletree   robin had flown   one   branches  had burst out into  scrap   song ben weatherstaff laughed outright “what did  do  for” asked mary “he’s made up his mind  make friends  thee” replied ben “dang me if  hasn’t took  fancy  thee” “to me” said mary  she moved toward  little tree softly  looked up “would you make friends  me” she said   robin just  if she  speaking   person “would you” and she did not say  either  her hard little voice or  her imperious indian voice but   tone so soft  eager  coaxing  ben weatherstaff   surprised  she had been when she heard him whistle “why”  cried out “tha’ said   nice an’ human  if tha’   real child instead   sharp old woman tha’ said  almost like dickon talks  his wild things  th’ moor” “do you know dickon” mary asked turning round rather   hurry “everybody knows him dickon’s wanderin’ about everywhere th’ very blackberries an’ heatherbells knows him i warrant th’ foxes shows him where their cubs lies an’ th’ skylarks doesn’t hide their nests  him” mary would have liked  ask some more questions she  almost  curious about dickon  she  about  deserted garden but just  moment  robin who had ended his song gave  little shake  his wings spread them  flew away he had made his visit  had other things  do “he  flown over  wall” mary cried out watching him “he  flown into  orchard—he  flown across  other wall—into  garden where there  no door” “he lives there” said old ben “he came out o’ th’ egg there if he’s courtin’ he’s makin’ up  some young madam   robin  lives among th’ old rosetrees there” “rosetrees” said mary “are there rosetrees” ben weatherstaff took up his spade again  began  dig “there  ten year’ ago”  mumbled “i should like  see them” said mary “where   green door there must   door somewhere” ben drove his spade deep  looked  uncompanionable   had looked when she first saw him “there  ten year’ ago but there isn’t now”  said “no door” cried mary “there must be” “none  anyone can find an’ none   anyone’s business don’t you   meddlesome wench an’ poke your nose where it’s no cause  go here i must go   my work get you gone an’ play you i’ve no more time” and  actually stopped digging threw his spade over his shoulder  walked off without even glancing  her or saying goodby chapter v the cry in the corridor at first each day which passed   mary lennox  exactly like  others every morning she awoke  her tapestried room  found martha kneeling upon  hearth building her fire every morning she ate her breakfast   nursery which had nothing amusing  it  after each breakfast she gazed out   window across   huge moor which seemed  spread out  all sides  climb up   sky  after she had stared   while she realized  if she did not go out she would have  stay   do nothing—and so she went out she did not know  this   best thing she could have done  she did not know that when she began  walk quickly or even run along  paths  down  avenue she  stirring her slow blood  making herself stronger  fighting   wind which swept down   moor she ran only  make herself warm  she hated  wind which rushed  her face  roared  held her back  if   some giant she could not see but  big breaths  rough fresh air blown over  heather filled her lungs  something which  good  her whole thin body  whipped some red color into her cheeks  brightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it but after  few days spent almost entirely out  doors she wakened one morning knowing what     hungry  when she sat down  her breakfast she did not glance disdainfully  her porridge  push  away but took up her spoon  began  eat   went  eating  until her bowl  empty “tha’ got  well enough   this mornin’ didn’t tha’” said martha “it tastes nice today” said mary feeling  little surprised herself “it’s th’ air  th’ moor that’s givin’ thee stomach  tha’ victuals” answered martha “it’s lucky  thee  tha’s got victuals  well  appetite there’s been twelve  our cottage  had th’ stomach an’ nothin’  put  it you go  playin’ you out o’ doors every day an’ you’ll get some flesh  your bones an’ you won’t  so yeller” “i don’t play” said mary “i have nothing  play with” “nothin’  play with” exclaimed martha “our children plays  sticks  stones they just runs about an’ shouts an’ looks  things” mary did not shout but she looked  things there  nothing else  do she walked round  round  gardens  wandered about  paths   park sometimes she looked  ben weatherstaff but though several times she saw him  work   too busy  look  her or  too surly once when she  walking toward him  picked up his spade  turned away  if  did   purpose one place she went  oftener than  any other it   long walk outside  gardens   walls round them there  bare flowerbeds  either side    against  walls ivy grew thickly there  one part   wall where  creeping dark green leaves  more bushy than elsewhere it seemed  if   long time  part had been neglected the rest   had been clipped  made  look neat but  this lower end   walk  had not been trimmed  all a few days after she had talked  ben weatherstaff mary stopped  notice this  wondered why   so she had just paused   looking up   long spray  ivy swinging   wind when she saw  gleam  scarlet  heard  brilliant chirp  there   top   wall perched ben weatherstaff’s robin redbreast tilting forward  look  her  his small head  one side “oh” she cried out “is  you—is  you” and  did not seem  all queer  her  she spoke  him  if she  sure   would understand  answer her he did answer he twittered  chirped  hopped along  wall  if   telling her all sorts  things it seemed  mistress mary  if she understood him too though   not speaking  words it   if  said “good morning isn’t  wind nice isn’t  sun nice isn’t everything nice let us both chirp  hop  twitter come on come on” mary began  laugh    hopped  took little flights along  wall she ran after him poor little thin sallow ugly mary—she actually looked almost pretty   moment “i like you i like you” she cried out pattering down  walk  she chirped  tried  whistle which last she did not know how  do   least but  robin seemed   quite satisfied  chirped  whistled back  her at last  spread his wings  made  darting flight   top   tree where  perched  sang loudly that reminded mary   first time she had seen him he had been swinging   treetop then  she had been standing   orchard now she    other side   orchard  standing   path outside  wall—much lower down—and there   same tree inside “it’s   garden no one can go into” she said  herself “it’s  garden without  door he lives  there how i wish i could see what   like” she ran up  walk   green door she had entered  first morning then she ran down  path through  other door  then into  orchard  when she stood  looked up there   tree   other side   wall  there   robin just finishing his song  beginning  preen his feathers  his beak “it   garden” she said “i am sure  is” she walked round  looked closely   side   orchard wall but she only found what she had found before—that there  no door  it then she ran through  kitchengardens again  out into  walk outside  long ivycovered wall  she walked   end    looked  it but there  no door  then she walked   other end looking again but there  no door “it’s very queer” she said “ben weatherstaff said there  no door  there  no door but there must have been one ten years ago because mr craven buried  key” this gave her so much  think   she began   quite interested  feel  she  not sorry  she had come  misselthwaite manor in india she had always felt hot  too languid  care much about anything the fact    fresh wind   moor had begun  blow  cobwebs out  her young brain   waken her up  little she stayed out  doors nearly all day  when she sat down  her supper  night she felt hungry  drowsy  comfortable she did not feel cross when martha chattered away she felt  if she rather liked  hear her   last she thought she would ask her  question she asked  after she had finished her supper  had sat down   hearthrug before  fire “why did mr craven hate  garden” she said she had made martha stay  her  martha had not objected  all she  very young  used   crowded cottage full  brothers  sisters  she found  dull   great servants’ hall downstairs where  footman  upperhousemaids made fun  her yorkshire speech  looked upon her   common little thing  sat  whispered among themselves martha liked  talk   strange child who had lived  india  been waited upon  “blacks”  novelty enough  attract her she sat down   hearth herself without waiting   asked “art tha’ thinkin’ about  garden yet” she said “i knew tha’ would that  just  way  me when i first heard about it” “why did  hate it” mary persisted martha tucked her feet under her  made herself quite comfortable “listen  th’ wind wutherin’ round  house” she said “you could bare stand up   moor if you  out   tonight” mary did not know what “wutherin’” meant until she listened  then she understood it must mean  hollow shuddering sort  roar which rushed round  round  house  if  giant no one could see  buffeting   beating   walls  windows  try  break in but one knew  could not get in  somehow  made one feel very safe  warm inside  room   red coal fire “but why did  hate  so” she asked after she had listened she intended  know if martha did then martha gave up her store  knowledge “mind” she said “mrs medlock said it’s not   talked about there’s lots o’ things  this place that’s not   talked over that’s mr craven’s orders his troubles  none servants’ business  says but  th’ garden  wouldn’t  like  is it  mrs craven’s garden  she had made when first they  married an’ she just loved it an’ they used  ’tend  flowers themselves an’ none o’ th’ gardeners  ever let  go in him an’ her used  go  an’ shut th’ door an’ stay there hours an’ hours readin’  talkin’ an’ she  just  bit   girl an’ there   old tree   branch bent like  seat  it an’ she made roses grow over  an’ she used  sit there but one day when she  sittin’ there th’ branch broke an’ she fell  th’ ground an’  hurt so bad  next day she died th’ doctors thought he’d go out o’ his mind an’ die too that’s why  hates it no one’s never gone  since an’  won’t let anyone talk about it” mary did not ask any more questions she looked   red fire  listened   wind “wutherin’” it seemed   “wutherin’” louder than ever at  moment  very good thing  happening  her four good things had happened  her  fact since she came  misselthwaite manor she had felt  if she had understood  robin    had understood her she had run   wind until her blood had grown warm she had been healthily hungry   first time  her life  she had found out what     sorry  someone but  she  listening   wind she began  listen  something else she did not know what  was because  first she could scarcely distinguish    wind itself it   curious sound—it seemed almost  if  child  crying somewhere sometimes  wind sounded rather like  child crying but presently mistress mary felt quite sure this sound  inside  house not outside it it  far away but   inside she turned round  looked  martha “do you hear anyone crying” she said martha suddenly looked confused “no” she answered “it’s th’ wind sometimes  sounds like  if someone  lost  th’ moor an’ wailin’ it’s got all sorts o’ sounds” “but listen” said mary “it’s   house—down one  those long corridors” and   very moment  door must have been opened somewhere downstairs   great rushing draft blew along  passage   door   room they sat   blown open   crash   they both jumped  their feet  light  blown out   crying sound  swept down  far corridor so      heard more plainly than ever “there” said mary “i told you so it  someone crying—and  isn’t  grownup person” martha ran  shut  door  turned  key but before she did  they both heard  sound   door  some far passage shutting   bang  then everything  quiet  even  wind ceased “wutherin’”   few moments “it  th’ wind” said martha stubbornly “an’ if  wasn’t   little betty butterworth th’ scullerymaid she’s had th’ toothache all day” but something troubled  awkward  her manner made mistress mary stare very hard  her she did not believe she  speaking  truth chapter vi “there was someone crying—there was” the next day  rain poured down  torrents again  when mary looked out  her window  moor  almost hidden  gray mist  cloud there could  no going out today “what do you do  your cottage when  rains like this” she asked martha “try  keep  under each other’s feet mostly” martha answered “eh there does seem  lot  us then mother’s  goodtempered woman but she gets fair moithered the biggest ones goes out  th’ cowshed  plays there dickon  doesn’t mind th’ wet he goes out just th’ same  if th’ sun  shinin’ he says  sees things  rainy days  doesn’t show when it’s fair weather he once found  little fox cub half drowned   hole   brought  home  th’ bosom  his shirt  keep  warm its mother had been killed nearby an’ th’ hole  swum out an’ th’ rest o’ th’ litter  dead he’s got   home now he found  halfdrowned young crow another time an’  brought  home too an’ tamed it it’s named soot because it’s so black an’  hops an’ flies about  him everywhere” the time had come when mary had forgotten  resent martha’s familiar talk she had even begun  find  interesting    sorry when she stopped or went away the stories she had been told  her ayah when she lived  india had been quite unlike those martha had  tell about  moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived  four little rooms  never had quite enough  eat the children seemed  tumble about  amuse themselves like  litter  rough goodnatured collie puppies mary  most attracted   mother  dickon when martha told stories  what “mother” said or did they always sounded comfortable “if i had  raven or  fox cub i could play  it” said mary “but i have nothing” martha looked perplexed “can tha’ knit” she asked “no” answered mary “can tha’ sew” “no” “can tha’ read” “yes” “then why doesn’t tha read somethin’ or learn  bit o’ spellin’ tha’st old enough   learnin’ thy book  good bit now” “i haven’t any books” said mary “those i had  left  india” “that’s  pity” said martha “if mrs medlock’d let thee go into th’ library there’s thousands o’ books there” mary did not ask where  library was because she  suddenly inspired   new idea she made up her mind  go  find  herself she  not troubled about mrs medlock mrs medlock seemed always    her comfortable housekeeper’s sittingroom downstairs in this queer place one scarcely ever saw anyone  all in fact there  no one  see but  servants  when their master  away they lived  luxurious life below stairs where there   huge kitchen hung about  shining brass  pewter   large servants’ hall where there  four or five abundant meals eaten every day  where  great deal  lively romping went  when mrs medlock  out   way mary’s meals  served regularly  martha waited  her but no one troubled themselves about her   least mrs medlock came  looked  her every day or two but no one inquired what she did or told her what  do she supposed  perhaps this   english way  treating children in india she had always been attended  her ayah who had followed her about  waited  her hand  foot she had often been tired  her company now she  followed  nobody   learning  dress herself because martha looked  though she thought she  silly  stupid when she wanted  have things handed  her  put on “hasn’t tha’ got good sense” she said once when mary had stood waiting  her  put  her gloves  her “our susan ann  twice  sharp  thee an’ she’s only four year’ old sometimes tha’ looks fair soft  th’ head” mary had worn her contrary scowl   hour after that but  made her think several entirely new things she stood   window  about ten minutes this morning after martha had swept up  hearth   last time  gone downstairs she  thinking over  new idea which had come  her when she heard   library she did not care very much about  library itself because she had read very few books but  hear   brought back  her mind  hundred rooms  closed doors she wondered if they  all really locked  what she would find if she could get into any  them were there  hundred really why shouldn’t she go  see how many doors she could count it would  something  do  this morning when she could not go out she had never been taught  ask permission  do things  she knew nothing  all about authority so she would not have thought  necessary  ask mrs medlock if she might walk about  house even if she had seen her she opened  door   room  went into  corridor  then she began her wanderings it   long corridor   branched into other corridors   led her up short flights  steps which mounted  others again there  doors  doors  there  pictures   walls sometimes they  pictures  dark curious landscapes but oftenest they  portraits  men  women  queer grand costumes made  satin  velvet she found herself  one long gallery whose walls  covered  these portraits she had never thought there could  so many  any house she walked slowly down this place  stared   faces which also seemed  stare  her she felt  if they  wondering what  little girl  india  doing  their house some  pictures  children—little girls  thick satin frocks which reached  their feet  stood out about them  boys  puffed sleeves  lace collars  long hair or  big ruffs around their necks she always stopped  look   children  wonder what their names were  where they had gone  why they wore such odd clothes there   stiff plain little girl rather like herself she wore  green brocade dress  held  green parrot  her finger her eyes had  sharp curious look “where do you live now” said mary aloud  her “i wish you  here” surely no other little girl ever spent such  queer morning it seemed  if there  no one  all  huge rambling house but her own small self wandering about upstairs  down through narrow passages  wide ones where  seemed  her  no one but herself had ever walked since so many rooms had been built people must have lived  them but  all seemed so empty  she could not quite believe  true it  not until she climbed   second floor  she thought  turning  handle   door all  doors  shut  mrs medlock had said they were but  last she put her hand   handle  one  them  turned it she  almost frightened   moment when she felt   turned without difficulty   when she pushed upon  door itself  slowly  heavily opened it   massive door  opened into  big bedroom there  embroidered hangings   wall  inlaid furniture such  she had seen  india stood about  room a broad window  leaded panes looked out upon  moor  over  mantel  another portrait   stiff plain little girl who seemed  stare  her more curiously than ever “perhaps she slept here once” said mary “she stares  me so  she makes me feel queer” after  she opened more doors  more she saw so many rooms  she became quite tired  began  think  there must   hundred though she had not counted them in all  them there  old pictures or old tapestries  strange scenes worked  them there  curious pieces  furniture  curious ornaments  nearly all  them in one room which looked like  lady’s sittingroom  hangings  all embroidered velvet    cabinet  about  hundred little elephants made  ivory they   different sizes  some had their mahouts or palanquins  their backs some  much bigger than  others  some  so tiny  they seemed only babies mary had seen carved ivory  india  she knew all about elephants she opened  door   cabinet  stood   footstool  played  these  quite  long time when she got tired she set  elephants  order  shut  door   cabinet in all her wanderings through  long corridors   empty rooms she had seen nothing alive but  this room she saw something just after she had closed  cabinet door she heard  tiny rustling sound it made her jump  look around   sofa   fireplace  which  seemed  come in  corner   sofa there   cushion    velvet which covered  there   hole  out   hole peeped  tiny head   pair  frightened eyes  it mary crept softly across  room  look the bright eyes belonged   little gray mouse   mouse had eaten  hole into  cushion  made  comfortable nest there six baby mice  cuddled up asleep near her if there  no one else alive   hundred rooms there  seven mice who did not look lonely  all “if they wouldn’t  so frightened i would take them back  me” said mary she had wandered about long enough  feel too tired  wander any farther  she turned back two or three times she lost her way  turning down  wrong corridor   obliged  ramble up  down until she found  right one but  last she reached her own floor again though she  some distance  her own room  did not know exactly where she was “i believe i have taken  wrong turning again” she said standing still  what seemed  end   short passage  tapestry   wall “i don’t know which way  go how still everything is” it  while she  standing here  just after she had said this   stillness  broken   sound it  another cry but not quite like  one she had heard last night   only  short one  fretful childish whine muffled  passing through walls “it’s nearer than  was” said mary her heart beating rather faster “and  is crying” she put her hand accidentally upon  tapestry near her  then sprang back feeling quite startled the tapestry   covering   door which fell open  showed her  there  another part   corridor behind it  mrs medlock  coming up   her bunch  keys  her hand   very cross look  her face “what  you doing here” she said  she took mary   arm  pulled her away “what did i tell you” “i turned round  wrong corner” explained mary “i didn’t know which way  go  i heard someone crying” she quite hated mrs medlock   moment but she hated her more  next “you didn’t hear anything   sort” said  housekeeper “you come along back  your own nursery or i’ll box your ears” and she took her   arm  half pushed half pulled her up one passage  down another until she pushed her    door  her own room “now” she said “you stay where you’re told  stay or you’ll find yourself locked up the master had better get you  governess same   said  would you’re one  needs someone  look sharp after you i’ve got enough  do” she went out   room  slammed  door after her  mary went  sat   hearthrug pale  rage she did not cry but ground her teeth “there was someone crying—there was—there was” she said  herself she had heard  twice now  sometime she would find out she had found out  great deal this morning she felt  if she had been   long journey   any rate she had had something  amuse her all  time  she had played   ivory elephants  had seen  gray mouse   babies  their nest   velvet cushion chapter vii the key to the garden two days after this when mary opened her eyes she sat upright  bed immediately  called  martha “look   moor look   moor” the rainstorm had ended   gray mist  clouds had been swept away   night   wind the wind itself had ceased   brilliant deep blue sky arched high over  moorland never never had mary dreamed   sky so blue in india skies  hot  blazing this    deep cool blue which almost seemed  sparkle like  waters  some lovely bottomless lake  here  there high high   arched blueness floated small clouds  snowwhite fleece the farreaching world   moor itself looked softly blue instead  gloomy purpleblack or awful dreary gray “aye” said martha   cheerful grin “th’ storm’s over   bit it does like this  this time o’ th’ year it goes off   night like   pretendin’  had never been here an’ never meant  come again that’s because th’ springtime’s   way it’s  long way off yet but it’s comin’” “i thought perhaps  always rained or looked dark  england” mary said “eh no” said martha sitting up  her heels among her black lead brushes “nowt o’ th’ soart” “what does  mean” asked mary seriously in india  natives spoke different dialects which only  few people understood so she  not surprised when martha used words she did not know martha laughed  she had done  first morning “there now” she said “i’ve talked broad yorkshire again like mrs medlock said i mustn’t ‘nowt o’ th’ soart’ means ‘nothin’ofthesort’” slowly  carefully “but  takes so long  say it yorkshire’s th’ sunniest place  earth when   sunny i told thee tha’d like th’ moor after  bit just you wait till you see th’ goldcolored gorse blossoms an’ th’ blossoms o’ th’ broom an’ th’ heather flowerin’ all purple bells an’ hundreds o’ butterflies flutterin’ an’ bees hummin’ an’ skylarks soarin’ up an’ singin’ you’ll want  get out    sunrise an’ live out   all day like dickon does” “could i ever get there” asked mary wistfully looking through her window   faroff blue it  so new  big  wonderful  such  heavenly color “i don’t know” answered martha “tha’s never used tha’ legs since tha’  born  seems  me tha’ couldn’t walk five mile it’s five mile  our cottage” “i should like  see your cottage” martha stared  her  moment curiously before she took up her polishing brush  began  rub  grate again she  thinking   small plain face did not look quite  sour  this moment   had done  first morning she saw it it looked just  trifle like little susan ann’s when she wanted something very much “i’ll ask my mother about it” she said “she’s one o’ them  nearly always sees  way  do things it’s my day out today an’ i’m goin’ home eh i am glad mrs medlock thinks  lot o’ mother perhaps she could talk  her” “i like your mother” said mary “i should think tha’ did” agreed martha polishing away “i’ve never seen her” said mary “no tha’ hasn’t” replied martha she sat up  her heels again  rubbed  end  her nose   back  her hand  if puzzled   moment but she ended quite positively “well she’s  sensible an’ hard workin’ an’ goodnatured an’ clean  no one could help likin’ her whether they’d seen her or not when i’m goin’ home  her  my day out i just jump  joy when i’m crossin’  moor” “i like dickon” added mary “and i’ve never seen him” “well” said martha stoutly “i’ve told thee  th’ very birds likes him an’ th’ rabbits an’ wild sheep an’ ponies an’ th’ foxes themselves i wonder” staring  her reflectively “what dickon would think  thee” “he wouldn’t like me” said mary  her stiff cold little way “no one does” martha looked reflective again “how does tha’ like thysel’” she inquired really quite  if she  curious  know mary hesitated  moment  thought  over “not  all—really” she answered “but i never thought   before” martha grinned  little  if  some homely recollection “mother said   me once” she said “she   her washtub an’ i    bad temper an’ talkin’ ill  folk an’ she turns round  me an’ says ‘tha’ young vixen tha’ there tha’ stands sayin’ tha’ doesn’t like this one an’ tha’ doesn’t like  one how does tha’ like thysel’’ it made me laugh an’  brought me  my senses   minute” she went away  high spirits  soon  she had given mary her breakfast she  going  walk five miles across  moor   cottage  she  going  help her mother   washing  do  week’s baking  enjoy herself thoroughly mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she  no longer   house she went out into  garden  quickly  possible   first thing she did   run round  round  fountain flower garden ten times she counted  times carefully  when she had finished she felt  better spirits the sunshine made  whole place look different the high deep blue sky arched over misselthwaite  well  over  moor  she kept lifting her face  looking up into it trying  imagine what  would  like  lie down  one   little snowwhite clouds  float about she went into  first kitchengarden  found ben weatherstaff working there  two other gardeners the change   weather seemed  have done him good he spoke  her  his own accord “springtime’s comin’”  said “cannot tha’ smell it” mary sniffed  thought she could “i smell something nice  fresh  damp” she said “that’s th’ good rich earth”  answered digging away “it’s   good humor makin’ ready  grow things it’s glad when plantin’ time comes it’s dull  th’ winter when it’s got nowt  do in th’ flower gardens out there things   stirrin’ down below  th’ dark th’ sun’s warmin’ ’em you’ll see bits o’ green spikes stickin’ out o’ th’ black earth after  bit” “what  they be” asked mary “crocuses an’ snowdrops an’ daffydowndillys has tha’ never seen them” “no everything  hot  wet  green after  rains  india” said mary “and i think things grow up   night” “these won’t grow up   night” said weatherstaff “tha’ll have  wait  ’em they’ll poke up  bit higher here an’ push out  spike more there an’ uncurl  leaf this day an’ another that you watch ’em” “i am going to” answered mary very soon she heard  soft rustling flight  wings again  she knew  once   robin had come again he  very pert  lively  hopped about so close  her feet  put his head  one side  looked  her so slyly  she asked ben weatherstaff  question “do you think  remembers me” she said “remembers thee” said weatherstaff indignantly “he knows every cabbage stump  th’ gardens let alone th’ people he’s never seen  little wench here before an’ he’s bent  findin’ out all about thee tha’s no need  try  hide anything  him” “are things stirring down below   dark   garden where  lives” mary inquired “what garden” grunted weatherstaff becoming surly again “the one where  old rosetrees are” she could not help asking because she wanted so much  know “are all  flowers dead or do some  them come again   summer are there ever any roses” “ask him” said ben weatherstaff hunching his shoulders toward  robin “he’s  only one  knows no one else  seen inside   ten year’” ten years   long time mary thought she had been born ten years ago she walked away slowly thinking she had begun  like  garden just  she had begun  like  robin  dickon  martha’s mother she  beginning  like martha too that seemed  good many people  like—when you  not used  liking she thought   robin  one   people she went  her walk outside  long ivycovered wall over which she could see  treetops   second time she walked up  down  most interesting  exciting thing happened  her    all through ben weatherstaff’s robin she heard  chirp   twitter  when she looked   bare flowerbed  her left side there   hopping about  pretending  peck things out   earth  persuade her   had not followed her but she knew  had followed her   surprise so filled her  delight  she almost trembled  little “you do remember me” she cried out “you do you  prettier than anything else   world” she chirped  talked  coaxed   hopped  flirted his tail  twittered it   if   talking his red waistcoat  like satin   puffed his tiny breast out   so fine  so grand  so pretty    really  if   showing her how important  like  human person  robin could be mistress mary forgot  she had ever been contrary  her life when  allowed her  draw closer  closer  him  bend down  talk  try  make something like robin sounds oh  think   should actually let her come  near  him  that he knew nothing   world would make her put out her hand toward him or startle him   least tiniest way he knew  because    real person—only nicer than any other person   world she  so happy  she scarcely dared  breathe the flowerbed  not quite bare it  bare  flowers because  perennial plants had been cut down  their winter rest but there  tall shrubs  low ones which grew together   back   bed    robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over  small pile  freshly turned up earth he stopped    look   worm the earth had been turned up because  dog had been trying  dig up  mole   had scratched quite  deep hole mary looked  it not really knowing why  hole  there   she looked she saw something almost buried   newlyturned soil it  something like  ring  rusty iron or brass  when  robin flew up into  tree nearby she put out her hand  picked  ring up it  more than  ring however    old key which looked  if  had been buried  long time mistress mary stood up  looked     almost frightened face   hung  her finger “perhaps   been buried  ten years” she said   whisper “perhaps    key   garden” chapter viii the robin who showed the way she looked   key quite  long time she turned  over  over  thought about it as i have said before she  not  child who had been trained  ask permission or consult her elders about things all she thought about  key   if    key   closed garden  she could find out where  door was she could perhaps open   see what  inside  walls  what had happened   old rosetrees it  because  had been shut up so long  she wanted  see it it seemed  if  must  different  other places   something strange must have happened   during ten years besides that if she liked  she could go into  every day  shut  door behind her  she could make up some play  her own  play  quite alone because nobody would ever know where she was but would think  door  still locked   key buried   earth the thought   pleased her very much living   were all  herself   house   hundred mysteriously closed rooms  having nothing whatever  do  amuse herself had set her inactive brain  working   actually awakening her imagination there  no doubt   fresh strong pure air   moor had  great deal  do  it just   had given her  appetite  fighting   wind had stirred her blood so  same things had stirred her mind in india she had always been too hot  languid  weak  care much about anything but  this place she  beginning  care   want  do new things already she felt less “contrary” though she did not know why she put  key  her pocket  walked up  down her walk no one but herself ever seemed  come there so she could walk slowly  look   wall or rather   ivy growing  it the ivy   baffling thing howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but thickly growing glossy dark green leaves she  very much disappointed something  her contrariness came back  her  she paced  walk  looked over    treetops inside it seemed so silly she said  herself   near   not  able  get in she took  key  her pocket when she went back   house  she made up her mind  she would always carry   her when she went out so  if she ever should find  hidden door she would  ready mrs medlock had allowed martha  sleep all night   cottage but she  back  her work   morning  cheeks redder than ever    best  spirits “i got up  four o’clock” she said “eh   pretty  th’ moor  th’ birds gettin’ up an’ th’ rabbits scamperin’ about an’ th’ sun risin’ i didn’t walk all th’ way a man gave me  ride  his cart an’ i did enjoy myself” she  full  stories   delights  her day out her mother had been glad  see her  they had got  baking  washing all out   way she had even made each   children  doughcake   bit  brown sugar  it “i had ’em all pipin’ hot when they came   playin’  th’ moor an’ th’ cottage all smelt o’ nice clean hot bakin’ an’ there   good fire an’ they just shouted  joy our dickon  said our cottage  good enough   king  live in” in  evening they had all sat round  fire  martha  her mother had sewed patches  torn clothes  mended stockings  martha had told them about  little girl who had come  india  who had been waited  all her life  what martha called “blacks” until she didn’t know how  put  her own stockings “eh they did like  hear about you” said martha “they wanted  know all about th’ blacks an’ about th’ ship you came in i couldn’t tell ’em enough” mary reflected  little “i’ll tell you  great deal more before your next day out” she said “so  you  have more  talk about i dare say they would like  hear about riding  elephants  camels  about  officers going  hunt tigers” “my word” cried delighted martha “it would set ’em clean off their heads would tha’ really do that miss it would  same   wild beast show like we heard they had  york once” “india  quite different  yorkshire” mary said slowly  she thought  matter over “i never thought  that did dickon  your mother like  hear you talk about me” “why our dickon’s eyes nearly started out o’ his head they got  round” answered martha “but mother she  put out about your seemin’   all  yourself like she said ‘hasn’t mr craven got no governess  her nor no nurse’  i said ‘no  hasn’t though mrs medlock says   when  thinks  it but she says  mayn’t think    two or three years’” “i don’t want  governess” said mary sharply “but mother says you ought   learnin’ your book  this time an’ you ought  have  woman  look after you an’ she says ‘now martha you just think how you’d feel yourself   big place like that wanderin’ about all alone an’ no mother you do your best  cheer her up’ she says an’ i said i would” mary gave her  long steady look “you do cheer me up” she said “i like  hear you talk” presently martha went out   room  came back  something held  her hands under her apron “what does tha’ think” she said   cheerful grin “i’ve brought thee  present” “a present” exclaimed mistress mary how could  cottage full  fourteen hungry people give anyone  present “a man  drivin’ across  moor peddlin’” martha explained “an’  stopped his cart  our door he had pots an’ pans an’ odds an’ ends but mother had no money  buy anythin’ just    goin’ away our ’lizabeth ellen called out ‘mother he’s got skippin’ropes  red an’ blue handles’ an’ mother she calls out quite sudden ‘here stop mister how much  they’ an’  says ‘tuppence’ an’ mother she began fumblin’  her pocket an’ she says  me ‘martha tha’s brought me thy wages like  good lass an’ i’ve got four places  put every penny but i’m just goin’  take tuppence out    buy  child  skippin’rope’ an’ she bought one an’ here  is” she brought  out  under her apron  exhibited  quite proudly it   strong slender rope   striped red  blue handle  each end but mary lennox had never seen  skippingrope before she gazed     mystified expression “what   for” she asked curiously “for” cried out martha “does tha’ mean  they’ve not got skippin’ropes  india  all they’ve got elephants  tigers  camels no wonder most  ’em’s black this  what it’s for just watch me” and she ran into  middle   room and taking  handle  each hand began  skip  skip  skip while mary turned  her chair  stare  her   queer faces   old portraits seemed  stare  her too  wonder what  earth this common little cottager had  impudence   doing under their very noses but martha did not even see them the interest  curiosity  mistress mary’s face delighted her  she went  skipping  counted  she skipped until she had reached  hundred “i could skip longer than that” she said when she stopped “i’ve skipped  much  five hundred when i  twelve but i wasn’t  fat then  i am now an’ i   practice” mary got up  her chair beginning  feel excited herself “it looks nice” she said “your mother   kind woman do you think i could ever skip like that” “you just try it” urged martha handing her  skippingrope “you can’t skip  hundred  first but if you practice you’ll mount up that’s what mother said she says ‘nothin’  do her more good than skippin’ rope it’s th’ sensiblest toy  child can have let her play out  th’ fresh air skippin’ an’ it’ll stretch her legs an’ arms an’ give her some strength  ’em’” it  plain  there  not  great deal  strength  mistress mary’s arms  legs when she first began  skip she  not very clever  it but she liked  so much  she did not want  stop “put  tha’ things  run an’ skip out o’ doors” said martha “mother said i must tell you  keep out o’ doors  much  you could even when  rains  bit so  tha’ wrap up warm” mary put  her coat  hat  took her skippingrope over her arm she opened  door  go out  then suddenly thought  something  turned back rather slowly “martha” she said “they  your wages it  your twopence really thank you” she said  stiffly because she  not used  thanking people or noticing  they did things  her “thank you” she said  held out her hand because she did not know what else  do martha gave her hand  clumsy little shake  if she  not accustomed  this sort  thing either then she laughed “eh th’ art  queer oldwomanish thing” she said “if tha’d been our ’lizabeth ellen tha’d have given me  kiss” mary looked stiffer than ever “do you want me  kiss you” martha laughed again “nay not me” she answered “if tha’  different p’raps tha’d want  thysel’ but tha’ isn’t run off outside an’ play  thy rope” mistress mary felt  little awkward  she went out   room yorkshire people seemed strange  martha  always rather  puzzle  her at first she had disliked her very much but now she did not the skippingrope   wonderful thing she counted  skipped  skipped  counted until her cheeks  quite red  she  more interested than she had ever been since she  born the sun  shining   little wind  blowing—not  rough wind but one which came  delightful little gusts  brought  fresh scent  newly turned earth  it she skipped round  fountain garden  up one walk  down another she skipped  last into  kitchengarden  saw ben weatherstaff digging  talking  his robin which  hopping about him she skipped down  walk toward him   lifted his head  looked  her   curious expression she had wondered if  would notice her she wanted him  see her skip “well”  exclaimed “upon my word p’raps tha’ art  young ’un after all an’ p’raps tha’s got child’s blood  thy veins instead  sour buttermilk tha’s skipped red into thy cheeks  sure  my name’s ben weatherstaff i wouldn’t have believed tha’ could do it” “i never skipped before” mary said “i’m just beginning i can only go up  twenty” “tha’ keep on” said ben “tha’ shapes well enough     young ’un that’s lived  heathen just see how he’s watchin’ thee” jerking his head toward  robin “he followed after thee yesterday he’ll    again today he’ll  bound  find out what th’ skippin’rope is he’s never seen one eh” shaking his head   bird “tha’ curiosity   th’ death  thee sometime if tha’ doesn’t look sharp” mary skipped round all  gardens  round  orchard resting every few minutes at length she went  her own special walk  made up her mind  try if she could skip  whole length  it it   good long skip  she began slowly but before she had gone halfway down  path she  so hot  breathless  she  obliged  stop she did not mind much because she had already counted up  thirty she stopped   little laugh  pleasure  there lo  behold   robin swaying   long branch  ivy he had followed her   greeted her   chirp as mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy  her pocket strike against her  each jump  when she saw  robin she laughed again “you showed me where  key  yesterday” she said “you ought  show me  door today but i don’t believe you know” the robin flew  his swinging spray  ivy    top   wall   opened his beak  sang  loud lovely trill merely  show off nothing   world  quite  adorably lovely   robin when  shows off—and they  nearly always doing it mary lennox had heard  great deal about magic  her ayah’s stories  she always said  what happened almost   moment  magic one   nice little gusts  wind rushed down  walk     stronger one than  rest it  strong enough  wave  branches   trees    more than strong enough  sway  trailing sprays  untrimmed ivy hanging   wall mary had stepped close   robin  suddenly  gust  wind swung aside some loose ivy trails  more suddenly still she jumped toward   caught   her hand this she did because she had seen something under it—a round knob which had been covered   leaves hanging over it it   knob   door she put her hands under  leaves  began  pull  push them aside thick   ivy hung  nearly all   loose  swinging curtain though some had crept over wood  iron mary’s heart began  thump  her hands  shake  little  her delight  excitement the robin kept singing  twittering away  tilting his head  one side  if    excited  she was what  this under her hands which  square  made  iron  which her fingers found  hole in it   lock   door which had been closed ten years  she put her hand  her pocket drew out  key  found  fitted  keyhole she put  key   turned it it took two hands  do it but  did turn and then she took  long breath  looked behind her up  long walk  see if anyone  coming no one  coming no one ever did come  seemed  she took another long breath because she could not help it  she held back  swinging curtain  ivy  pushed back  door which opened slowly—slowly then she slipped through it  shut  behind her  stood  her back against it looking about her  breathing quite fast  excitement  wonder  delight she  standing inside  secret garden chapter ix the strangest house anyone ever lived in it   sweetest most mysteriouslooking place anyone could imagine the high walls which shut    covered   leafless stems  climbing roses which  so thick  they  matted together mary lennox knew they  roses because she had seen  great many roses  india all  ground  covered  grass   wintry brown  out   grew clumps  bushes which  surely rosebushes if they  alive there  numbers  standard roses which had so spread their branches  they  like little trees there  other trees   garden  one   things which made  place look strangest  loveliest   climbing roses had run all over them  swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains  here  there they had caught  each other or   farreaching branch  had crept  one tree  another  made lovely bridges  themselves there  neither leaves nor roses  them now  mary did not know whether they  dead or alive but their thin gray or brown branches  sprays looked like  sort  hazy mantle spreading over everything walls  trees  even brown grass where they had fallen  their fastenings  run along  ground it  this hazy tangle  tree  tree which made  all look so mysterious mary had thought  must  different  other gardens which had not been left all  themselves so long  indeed   different  any other place she had ever seen  her life “how still  is” she whispered “how still” then she waited  moment  listened   stillness the robin who had flown  his treetop  still  all  rest he did not even flutter his wings  sat without stirring  looked  mary “no wonder   still” she whispered again “i am  first person who  spoken  here  ten years” she moved away   door stepping  softly  if she  afraid  awakening someone she  glad  there  grass under her feet   her steps made no sounds she walked under one   fairylike gray arches between  trees  looked up   sprays  tendrils which formed them “i wonder if they  all quite dead” she said “is  all  quite dead garden i wish  wasn’t” if she had been ben weatherstaff she could have told whether  wood  alive  looking  it but she could only see  there  only gray or brown sprays  branches  none showed any signs  even  tiny leafbud anywhere but she  inside  wonderful garden  she could come through  door under  ivy any time  she felt  if she had found  world all her own the sun  shining inside  four walls   high arch  blue sky over this particular piece  misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant  soft than   over  moor the robin flew down  his treetop  hopped about or flew after her  one bush  another he chirped  good deal  had  very busy air  if   showing her things everything  strange  silent  she seemed   hundreds  miles away  anyone but somehow she did not feel lonely  all all  troubled her  her wish  she knew whether all  roses  dead or if perhaps some  them had lived  might put out leaves  buds   weather got warmer she did not want     quite dead garden if    quite alive garden how wonderful  would be  what thousands  roses would grow  every side her skippingrope had hung over her arm when she came   after she had walked about   while she thought she would skip round  whole garden stopping when she wanted  look  things there seemed  have been grass paths here  there   one or two corners there  alcoves  evergreen  stone seats or tall mosscovered flower urns  them as she came near  second  these alcoves she stopped skipping there had once been  flowerbed  it  she thought she saw something sticking out   black earth—some sharp little pale green points she remembered what ben weatherstaff had said  she knelt down  look  them “yes they  tiny growing things  they might  crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils” she whispered she bent very close  them  sniffed  fresh scent   damp earth she liked  very much “perhaps there  some other ones coming up  other places” she said “i  go all over  garden  look” she did not skip but walked she went slowly  kept her eyes   ground she looked   old border beds  among  grass  after she had gone round trying  miss nothing she had found ever so many more sharp pale green points  she had become quite excited again “it isn’t  quite dead garden” she cried out softly  herself “even if  roses  dead there  other things alive” she did not know anything about gardening but  grass seemed so thick  some   places where  green points  pushing their way through  she thought they did not seem  have room enough  grow she searched about until she found  rather sharp piece  wood  knelt down  dug  weeded out  weeds  grass until she made nice little clear places around them “now they look  if they could breathe” she said after she had finished   first ones “i am going  do ever so many more i’ll do all i can see if i haven’t time today i can come tomorrow” she went  place  place  dug  weeded  enjoyed herself so immensely  she  led   bed  bed  into  grass under  trees the exercise made her so warm  she first threw her coat off  then her hat  without knowing  she  smiling down    grass   pale green points all  time the robin  tremendously busy he  very much pleased  see gardening begun  his own estate he had often wondered  ben weatherstaff where gardening  done all sorts  delightful things  eat  turned up   soil now here  this new kind  creature who  not half ben’s size  yet had had  sense  come into his garden  begin  once mistress mary worked  her garden until   time  go  her midday dinner in fact she  rather late  remembering  when she put  her coat  hat  picked up her skippingrope she could not believe  she had been working two or three hours she had been actually happy all  time  dozens  dozens   tiny pale green points    seen  cleared places looking twice  cheerful  they had looked before when  grass  weeds had been smothering them “i shall come back this afternoon” she said looking all round  her new kingdom  speaking   trees   rosebushes  if they heard her then she ran lightly across  grass pushed open  slow old door  slipped through  under  ivy she had such red cheeks  such bright eyes  ate such  dinner  martha  delighted “two pieces o’ meat an’ two helps o’ rice puddin’” she said “eh mother   pleased when i tell her what th’ skippin’rope’s done  thee” in  course  her digging  her pointed stick mistress mary had found herself digging up  sort  white root rather like  onion she had put  back   place  patted  earth carefully down    just now she wondered if martha could tell her what  was “martha” she said “what  those white roots  look like onions” “they’re bulbs” answered martha “lots o’ spring flowers grow  ’em th’ very little ones  snowdrops an’ crocuses an’ th’ big ones  narcissuses an’ jonquils  daffydowndillys th’ biggest  all  lilies an’ purple flags eh they  nice dickon’s got  whole lot  ’em planted  our bit o’ garden” “does dickon know all about them” asked mary  new idea taking possession  her “our dickon can make  flower grow out   brick walk mother says  just whispers things out o’ th’ ground” “do bulbs live  long time would they live years  years if no one helped them” inquired mary anxiously “they’re things  helps themselves” said martha “that’s why poor folk can afford  have ’em if you don’t trouble ’em most  ’em’ll work away underground   lifetime an’ spread out an’ have little ’uns there’s  place  th’ park woods here where there’s snowdrops  thousands they’re  prettiest sight  yorkshire when th’ spring comes no one knows when they  first planted” “i wish  spring  here now” said mary “i want  see all  things  grow  england” she had finished her dinner  gone  her favorite seat   hearthrug “i wish—i wish i had  little spade” she said “whatever does tha’ want  spade for” asked martha laughing “art tha’ goin’  take  diggin’ i must tell mother that too” mary looked   fire  pondered  little she must  careful if she meant  keep her secret kingdom she wasn’t doing any harm but if mr craven found out about  open door  would  fearfully angry  get  new key  lock  up forevermore she really could not bear that “this  such  big lonely place” she said slowly  if she  turning matters over  her mind “the house  lonely   park  lonely   gardens  lonely so many places seem shut up i never did many things  india but there  more people  look at—natives  soldiers marching by—and sometimes bands playing  my ayah told me stories there  no one  talk  here except you  ben weatherstaff and you have  do your work  ben weatherstaff won’t speak  me often i thought if i had  little spade i could dig somewhere   does  i might make  little garden if  would give me some seeds” martha’s face quite lighted up “there now” she exclaimed “if  wasn’t one  th’ things mother said she says ‘there’s such  lot o’ room   big place why don’t they give her  bit  herself even if she doesn’t plant nothin’ but parsley an’ radishes she’d dig an’ rake away an’  right down happy over it’ them   very words she said” “were they” said mary “how many things she knows doesn’t she” “eh” said martha “it’s like she says ‘a woman  brings up twelve children learns something besides her a b c children’s  good  ’rithmetic  set you findin’ out things’” “how much would  spade cost—a little one” mary asked “well”  martha’s reflective answer “at thwaite village there’s  shop or so an’ i saw little garden sets   spade an’  rake an’  fork all tied together  two shillings an’ they  stout enough  work with too” “i’ve got more than   my purse” said mary “mrs morrison gave me five shillings  mrs medlock gave me some money  mr craven” “did  remember thee  much” exclaimed martha “mrs medlock said i   have  shilling  week  spend she gives me one every saturday i didn’t know what  spend  on” “my word that’s riches” said martha “tha’ can buy anything  th’ world tha’ wants th’ rent  our cottage  only one an’ threepence an’ it’s like pullin’ eyeteeth  get it now i’ve just thought  somethin’” putting her hands  her hips “what” said mary eagerly “in  shop  thwaite they sell packages o’ flowerseeds   penny each  our dickon  knows which  th’ prettiest ones an’ how  make ’em grow he walks over  thwaite many  day just  th’ fun  it does tha’ know how  print letters” suddenly “i know how  write” mary answered martha shook her head “our dickon can only read printin’ if tha’ could print we could write  letter  him an’ ask him  go an’ buy th’ garden tools an’ th’ seeds  th’ same time” “oh you’re  good girl” mary cried “you are really i didn’t know you  so nice i know i can print letters if i try let’s ask mrs medlock   pen  ink  some paper” “i’ve got some  my own” said martha “i bought ’em so i could print  bit   letter  mother   sunday i’ll go  get it” she ran out   room  mary stood   fire  twisted her thin little hands together  sheer pleasure “if i have  spade” she whispered “i can make  earth nice  soft  dig up weeds if i have seeds  can make flowers grow  garden won’t  dead  all—it  come alive” she did not go out again  afternoon because when martha returned  her pen  ink  paper she  obliged  clear  table  carry  plates  dishes downstairs  when she got into  kitchen mrs medlock  there  told her  do something so mary waited  what seemed  her  long time before she came back then    serious piece  work  write  dickon mary had been taught very little because her governesses had disliked her too much  stay  her she could not spell particularly well but she found  she could print letters when she tried this   letter martha dictated  her “my dear dickon this comes hoping  find you well   leaves me  present miss mary  plenty  money   you go  thwaite  buy her some flower seeds   set  garden tools  make  flowerbed pick  prettiest ones  easy  grow because she  never done  before  lived  india which  different give my love  mother  everyone  you miss mary  going  tell me  lot more so   my next day out you can hear about elephants  camels  gentlemen going hunting lions  tigers “your loving sister “martha phœbe sowerby” “we’ll put  money  th’ envelope an’ i’ll get th’ butcher boy  take   his cart he’s  great friend o’ dickon’s” said martha “how shall i get  things when dickon buys them” “he’ll bring ’em  you himself he’ll like  walk over this way” “oh” exclaimed mary “then i shall see him i never thought i should see dickon” “does tha’ want  see him” asked martha suddenly  mary had looked so pleased “yes i do i never saw  boy foxes  crows loved i want  see him very much” martha gave  little start  if she remembered something “now  think” she broke out “to think o’ me forgettin’  there an’ i thought i  goin’  tell you first thing this mornin’ i asked mother—and she said she’d ask mrs medlock her own self” “do you mean—” mary began “what i said tuesday ask her if you might  driven over  our cottage some day  have  bit o’ mother’s hot oat cake an’ butter an’  glass o’ milk” it seemed  if all  interesting things  happening  one day to think  going over  moor   daylight  when  sky  blue to think  going into  cottage which held twelve children “does she think mrs medlock would let me go” she asked quite anxiously “aye she thinks she would she knows what  tidy woman mother   how clean she keeps  cottage” “if i went i should see your mother  well  dickon” said mary thinking  over  liking  idea very much “she doesn’t seem   like  mothers  india” her work   garden   excitement   afternoon ended  making her feel quiet  thoughtful martha stayed  her until teatime but they sat  comfortable quiet  talked very little but just before martha went downstairs   teatray mary asked  question “martha” she said “has  scullerymaid had  toothache again today” martha certainly started slightly “what makes thee ask that” she said “because when i waited so long  you  come back i opened  door  walked down  corridor  see if you  coming and i heard  faroff crying again just  we heard   other night there isn’t  wind today so you see  couldn’t have been  wind” “eh” said martha restlessly “tha’ mustn’t go walkin’ about  corridors an’ listenin’ mr craven would   there angry there’s no knowin’ what he’d do” “i wasn’t listening” said mary “i  just waiting  you—and i heard it that’s three times” “my word there’s mrs medlock’s bell” said martha  she almost ran out   room “it’s  strangest house anyone ever lived in” said mary drowsily  she dropped her head   cushioned seat   armchair near her fresh air  digging  skippingrope had made her feel so comfortably tired  she fell asleep chapter x dickon the sun shone down  nearly  week   secret garden the secret garden  what mary called  when she  thinking  it she liked  name  she liked still more  feeling  when  beautiful old walls shut her  no one knew where she was it seemed almost like being shut out   world  some fairy place the few books she had read  liked had been fairystory books  she had read  secret gardens  some   stories sometimes people went  sleep  them   hundred years which she had thought must  rather stupid she had no intention  going  sleep and  fact she  becoming wider awake every day which passed  misselthwaite she  beginning  like   out  doors she no longer hated  wind but enjoyed it she could run faster  longer  she could skip up   hundred the bulbs   secret garden must have been much astonished such nice clear places  made round them  they had all  breathing space they wanted  really if mistress mary had known it they began  cheer up under  dark earth  work tremendously the sun could get  them  warm them  when  rain came down  could reach them  once so they began  feel very much alive mary   odd determined little person  now she had something interesting   determined about she  very much absorbed indeed she worked  dug  pulled up weeds steadily only becoming more pleased  her work every hour instead  tiring  it it seemed  her like  fascinating sort  play she found many more   sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped  find they seemed   starting up everywhere  each day she  sure she found tiny new ones some so tiny  they barely peeped above  earth there  so many  she remembered what martha had said about  “snowdrops   thousands”  about bulbs spreading  making new ones these had been left  themselves  ten years  perhaps they had spread like  snowdrops into thousands she wondered how long  would  before they showed  they  flowers sometimes she stopped digging  look   garden  try  imagine what  would  like when   covered  thousands  lovely things  bloom during  week  sunshine she became more intimate  ben weatherstaff she surprised him several times  seeming  start up beside him  if she sprang out   earth the truth   she  afraid   would pick up his tools  go away if  saw her coming so she always walked toward him  silently  possible but  fact  did not object  her  strongly   had  first perhaps   secretly rather flattered  her evident desire  his elderly company then also she  more civil than she had been he did not know  when she first saw him she spoke  him  she would have spoken   native  had not known   cross sturdy old yorkshire man  not accustomed  salaam  his masters   merely commanded  them  do things “tha’rt like th’ robin”  said  her one morning when  lifted his head  saw her standing  him “i never knows when i shall see thee or which side tha’ll come from” “he’s friends  me now” said mary “that’s like him” snapped ben weatherstaff “makin’ up  th’ women folk just  vanity an’ flightiness there’s nothin’  wouldn’t do  th’ sake o’ showin’ off an’ flirtin’ his tailfeathers he’s  full o’ pride   egg’s full o’ meat” he very seldom talked much  sometimes did not even answer mary’s questions except   grunt but this morning  said more than usual he stood up  rested one hobnailed boot   top  his spade while  looked her over “how long  tha’ been here”  jerked out “i think it’s about  month” she answered “tha’s beginnin’  do misselthwaite credit”  said “tha’s  bit fatter than tha’  an’ tha’s not quite so yeller tha’ looked like  young plucked crow when tha’ first came into this garden thinks i  myself i never set eyes   uglier sourer faced young ’un” mary  not vain   she had never thought much  her looks she  not greatly disturbed “i know i’m fatter” she said “my stockings  getting tighter they used  make wrinkles there’s  robin ben weatherstaff” there indeed   robin  she thought  looked nicer than ever his red waistcoat   glossy  satin   flirted his wings  tail  tilted his head  hopped about  all sorts  lively graces he seemed determined  make ben weatherstaff admire him but ben  sarcastic “aye there tha’ art”  said “tha’ can put up  me   bit sometimes when tha’s got no one better tha’s been reddenin’ up thy waistcoat an’ polishin’ thy feathers this two weeks i know what tha’s up to tha’s courtin’ some bold young madam somewhere tellin’ thy lies  her about bein’ th’ finest cock robin  missel moor an’ ready  fight all th’ rest  ’em” “oh look  him” exclaimed mary the robin  evidently   fascinating bold mood he hopped closer  closer  looked  ben weatherstaff more  more engagingly he flew    nearest currant bush  tilted his head  sang  little song right  him “tha’ thinks tha’ll get over me  doin’ that” said ben wrinkling his face up  such  way  mary felt sure   trying not  look pleased “tha’ thinks no one can stand out against thee—that’s what tha’ thinks” the robin spread his wings—mary could scarcely believe her eyes he flew right up   handle  ben weatherstaff’s spade  alighted   top  it then  old man’s face wrinkled itself slowly into  new expression he stood still  if   afraid  breathe—as if  would not have stirred   world lest his robin should start away he spoke quite   whisper “well i’m danged”  said  softly  if   saying something quite different “tha’ does know how  get   chap—tha’ does tha’s fair unearthly tha’s so knowin’” and  stood without stirring—almost without drawing his breath—until  robin gave another flirt  his wings  flew away then  stood looking   handle   spade  if there might  magic  it  then  began  dig again  said nothing  several minutes but because  kept breaking into  slow grin now  then mary  not afraid  talk  him “have you  garden  your own” she asked “no i’m bachelder an’ lodge  martin  th’ gate” “if you had one” said mary “what would you plant” “cabbages an’ ’taters an’ onions” “but if you wanted  make  flower garden” persisted mary “what would you plant” “bulbs an’ sweetsmellin’ things—but mostly roses” mary’s face lighted up “do you like roses” she said ben weatherstaff rooted up  weed  threw  aside before  answered “well yes i do i  learned    young lady i  gardener to she had  lot   place she  fond of an’ she loved ’em like they  children—or robins i’ve seen her bend over an’ kiss ’em” he dragged out another weed  scowled  it “that   much  ten year’ ago” “where  she now” asked mary much interested “heaven”  answered  drove his spade deep into  soil “’cording  what parson says” “what happened   roses” mary asked again more interested than ever “they  left  themselves” mary  becoming quite excited “did they quite die do roses quite die when they  left  themselves” she ventured “well i’d got  like ’em—an’ i liked her—an’ she liked ’em” ben weatherstaff admitted reluctantly “once or twice  year i’d go an’ work  ’em  bit—prune ’em an’ dig about th’ roots they run wild but they   rich soil so some  ’em lived” “when they have no leaves  look gray  brown  dry how can you tell whether they  dead or alive” inquired mary “wait till th’ spring gets  ’em—wait till th’ sun shines  th’ rain  th’ rain falls  th’ sunshine an’ then tha’ll find out” “how—how” cried mary forgetting   careful “look along th’ twigs an’ branches an’ if tha’ see  bit   brown lump swelling here an’ there watch  after th’ warm rain an’ see what happens” he stopped suddenly  looked curiously  her eager face “why does tha’ care so much about roses an’ such all   sudden”  demanded mistress mary felt her face grow red she  almost afraid  answer “i—i want  play that—that i have  garden  my own” she stammered “i—there  nothing  me  do i have nothing—and no one” “well” said ben weatherstaff slowly   watched her “that’s true tha’ hasn’t” he said   such  odd way  mary wondered if   actually  little sorry  her she had never felt sorry  herself she had only felt tired  cross because she disliked people  things so much but now  world seemed   changing  getting nicer if no one found out about  secret garden she should enjoy herself always she stayed  him  ten or fifteen minutes longer  asked him  many questions  she dared he answered everyone  them  his queer grunting way   did not seem really cross  did not pick up his spade  leave her he said something about roses just  she  going away   reminded her   ones  had said  had been fond of “do you go  see those other roses now” she asked “not been this year my rheumatics  made me too stiff  th’ joints” he said   his grumbling voice  then quite suddenly  seemed  get angry  her though she did not see why  should “now look here”  said sharply “don’t tha’ ask so many questions tha’rt th’ worst wench  askin’ questions i’ve ever come across get thee gone an’ play thee i’ve done talkin’  today” and  said  so crossly  she knew there  not  least use  staying another minute she went skipping slowly down  outside walk thinking him over  saying  herself that queer   was here  another person whom she liked  spite  his crossness she liked old ben weatherstaff yes she did like him she always wanted  try  make him talk  her also she began  believe   knew everything   world about flowers there   laurelhedged walk which curved round  secret garden  ended   gate which opened into  wood   park she thought she would slip round this walk  look into  wood  see if there  any rabbits hopping about she enjoyed  skipping very much  when she reached  little gate she opened   went through because she heard  low peculiar whistling sound  wanted  find out what  was it   very strange thing indeed she quite caught her breath  she stopped  look  it a boy  sitting under  tree  his back against it playing   rough wooden pipe he   funny looking boy about twelve he looked very clean  his nose turned up  his cheeks   red  poppies  never had mistress mary seen such round  such blue eyes  any boy’s face and   trunk   tree  leaned against  brown squirrel  clinging  watching him   behind  bush nearby  cock pheasant  delicately stretching his neck  peep out  quite near him  two rabbits sitting up  sniffing  tremulous noses—and actually  appeared  if they  all drawing near  watch him  listen   strange low little call his pipe seemed  make when  saw mary  held up his hand  spoke  her   voice almost  low   rather like his piping “don’t tha’ move”  said “it’d flight ’em” mary remained motionless he stopped playing his pipe  began  rise   ground he moved so slowly   scarcely seemed  though   moving  all but  last  stood  his feet  then  squirrel scampered back up into  branches  his tree  pheasant withdrew his head   rabbits dropped  all fours  began  hop away though not  all  if they  frightened “i’m dickon”  boy said “i know tha’rt miss mary” then mary realized  somehow she had known  first    dickon who else could have been charming rabbits  pheasants   natives charm snakes  india he had  wide red curving mouth  his smile spread all over his face “i got up slow”  explained “because if tha’ makes  quick move  startles ’em a body ’as  move gentle an’ speak low when wild things  about” he did not speak  her  if they had never seen each other before but  if  knew her quite well mary knew nothing about boys  she spoke  him  little stiffly because she felt rather shy “did you get martha’s letter” she asked he nodded his curly rustcolored head “that’s why i come” he stooped  pick up something which had been lying   ground beside him when  piped “i’ve got th’ garden tools there’s  little spade an’ rake an’  fork an’ hoe eh they  good ’uns there’s  trowel too an’ th’ woman  th’ shop threw   packet o’ white poppy an’ one o’ blue larkspur when i bought th’ other seeds” “will you show  seeds  me” mary said she wished she could talk   did his speech  so quick  easy it sounded  if  liked her   not  least afraid she would not like him though   only  common moor boy  patched clothes    funny face   rough rustyred head as she came closer  him she noticed  there   clean fresh scent  heather  grass  leaves about him almost  if   made  them she liked  very much  when she looked into his funny face   red cheeks  round blue eyes she forgot  she had felt shy “let us sit down  this log  look  them” she said they sat down   took  clumsy little brown paper package out  his coat pocket he untied  string  inside there  ever so many neater  smaller packages   picture   flower  each one “there’s  lot o’ mignonette an’ poppies”  said “mignonette’s th’ sweetest smellin’ thing  grows an’ it’ll grow wherever you cast it same  poppies will them as’ll come up an’ bloom if you just whistle  ’em them’s th’ nicest  all” he stopped  turned his head quickly his poppycheeked face lighting up “where’s  robin   callin’ us”  said the chirp came   thick holly bush bright  scarlet berries  mary thought she knew whose  was “is  really calling us” she asked “aye” said dickon  if    most natural thing   world “he’s callin’ someone he’s friends with that’s same  sayin’ ‘here i am look  me i wants  bit   chat’ there     bush whose  he” “he’s ben weatherstaff’s but i think  knows me  little” answered mary “aye  knows thee” said dickon  his low voice again “an’  likes thee he’s took thee on he’ll tell me all about thee   minute” he moved quite close   bush   slow movement mary had noticed before  then  made  sound almost like  robin’s own twitter the robin listened  few seconds intently  then answered quite  if   replying   question “aye he’s  friend o’ yours” chuckled dickon “do you think  is” cried mary eagerly she did so want  know “do you think  really likes me” “he wouldn’t come near thee if  didn’t” answered dickon “birds  rare choosers an’  robin can flout  body worse than  man see he’s making up  thee now ‘cannot tha’ see  chap’ he’s sayin’” and  really seemed  if  must  true he so sidled  twittered  tilted   hopped  his bush “do you understand everything birds say” said mary dickon’s grin spread until  seemed all wide red curving mouth   rubbed his rough head “i think i do  they think i do”  said “i’ve lived  th’ moor  ’em so long i’ve watched ’em break shell an’ come out an’ fledge an’ learn  fly an’ begin  sing till i think i’m one  ’em sometimes i think p’raps i’m  bird or  fox or  rabbit or  squirrel or even  beetle an’ i don’t know it” he laughed  came back   log  began  talk about  flower seeds again he told her what they looked like when they  flowers  told her how  plant them  watch them  feed  water them “see here”  said suddenly turning round  look  her “i’ll plant them  thee myself where  tha’ garden” mary’s thin hands clutched each other  they lay  her lap she did not know what  say so   whole minute she said nothing she had never thought  this she felt miserable and she felt  if she went red  then pale “tha’s got  bit o’ garden hasn’t tha’” dickon said it  true  she had turned red  then pale dickon saw her do it   she still said nothing  began   puzzled “wouldn’t they give thee  bit”  asked “hasn’t tha’ got any yet” she held her hands tighter  turned her eyes toward him “i don’t know anything about boys” she said slowly “could you keep  secret if i told you one it’s  great secret i don’t know what i should do if anyone found  out i believe i should die” she said  last sentence quite fiercely dickon looked more puzzled than ever  even rubbed his hand over his rough head again but  answered quite goodhumoredly “i’m keepin’ secrets all th’ time”  said “if i couldn’t keep secrets  th’ other lads secrets about foxes’ cubs an’ birds’ nests an’ wild things’ holes there’d  naught safe  th’ moor aye i can keep secrets” mistress mary did not mean  put out her hand  clutch his sleeve but she did it “i’ve stolen  garden” she said very fast “it isn’t mine it isn’t anybody’s nobody wants it nobody cares  it nobody ever goes into it perhaps everything  dead   already i don’t know” she began  feel hot   contrary  she had ever felt  her life “i don’t care i don’t care nobody  any right  take   me when i care about   they don’t they’re letting  die all shut   itself” she ended passionately  she threw her arms over her face  burst out crying—poor little mistress mary dickon’s curious blue eyes grew rounder  rounder “ehhh”  said drawing his exclamation out slowly   way  did  meant both wonder  sympathy “i’ve nothing  do” said mary “nothing belongs  me i found  myself  i got into  myself i  only just like  robin  they wouldn’t take    robin” “where  it” asked dickon   dropped voice mistress mary got up   log  once she knew she felt contrary again  obstinate  she did not care  all she  imperious  indian    same time hot  sorrowful “come  me  i’ll show you” she said she led him round  laurel path    walk where  ivy grew so thickly dickon followed her   queer almost pitying look  his face he felt  if   being led  look  some strange bird’s nest  must move softly when she stepped   wall  lifted  hanging ivy  started there   door  mary pushed  slowly open  they passed  together  then mary stood  waved her hand round defiantly “it’s this” she said “it’s  secret garden  i’m  only one   world who wants    alive” dickon looked round  round about it  round  round again “eh”  almost whispered “it   queer pretty place it’s like  if  body    dream” chapter xi the nest of the missel thrush for two or three minutes  stood looking round him while mary watched him  then  began  walk about softly even more lightly than mary had walked  first time she had found herself inside  four walls his eyes seemed   taking  everything—the gray trees   gray creepers climbing over them  hanging  their branches  tangle   walls  among  grass  evergreen alcoves   stone seats  tall flower urns standing  them “i never thought i’d see this place”  said  last   whisper “did you know about it” asked mary she had spoken aloud   made  sign  her “we must talk low”  said “or someone’ll hear us an’ wonder what’s  do  here” “oh i forgot” said mary feeling frightened  putting her hand quickly against her mouth “did you know about  garden” she asked again when she had recovered herself dickon nodded “martha told me there  one  no one ever went inside”  answered “us used  wonder what   like” he stopped  looked round   lovely gray tangle about him  his round eyes looked queerly happy “eh  nests as’ll  here come springtime”  said “it’d  th’ safest nestin’ place  england no one never comin’ near an’ tangles o’ trees an’ roses  build in i wonder all th’ birds  th’ moor don’t build here” mistress mary put her hand  his arm again without knowing it “will there  roses” she whispered “can you tell i thought perhaps they  all dead” “eh no not them—not all  ’em”  answered “look here” he stepped over   nearest tree—an old old one  gray lichen all over  bark but upholding  curtain  tangled sprays  branches he took  thick knife out  his pocket  opened one   blades “there’s lots o’ dead wood  ought   cut out”  said “an’ there’s  lot o’ old wood but  made some new last year this here’s  new bit”   touched  shoot which looked brownish green instead  hard dry gray mary touched  herself   eager reverent way “that one” she said “is  one quite alive quite” dickon curved his wide smiling mouth “it’s  wick  you or me”  said  mary remembered  martha had told her  “wick” meant “alive” or “lively” “i’m glad it’s wick” she cried out  her whisper “i want them all   wick let us go round  garden  count how many wick ones there are” she quite panted  eagerness  dickon   eager  she was they went  tree  tree   bush  bush dickon carried his knife  his hand  showed her things which she thought wonderful “they’ve run wild”  said “but th’ strongest ones  fair thrived  it the delicatest ones  died out but th’ others  growed an’ growed an’ spread an’ spread till they’s  wonder see here”   pulled down  thick gray drylooking branch “a body might think this  dead wood but i don’t believe  is—down  th’ root i’ll cut  low down an’ see” he knelt   his knife cut  lifelesslooking branch through not far above  earth “there”  said exultantly “i told thee so there’s green   wood yet look  it” mary  down  her knees before  spoke gazing  all her might “when  looks  bit greenish an’ juicy like that it’s wick”  explained “when th’ inside  dry an’ breaks easy like this here piece i’ve cut off it’s done for there’s  big root here  all this live wood sprung out of an’ if th’ old wood’s cut off an’ it’s dug round  took care  there’ll be—”  stopped  lifted his face  look up   climbing  hanging sprays above him—“there’ll   fountain o’ roses here this summer” they went  bush  bush   tree  tree he  very strong  clever  his knife  knew how  cut  dry  dead wood away  could tell when  unpromising bough or twig had still green life  it in  course  half  hour mary thought she could tell too  when  cut through  lifelesslooking branch she would cry out joyfully under her breath when she caught sight   least shade  moist green the spade  hoe  fork  very useful he showed her how  use  fork while  dug about roots   spade  stirred  earth  let  air in they  working industriously round one   biggest standard roses when  caught sight  something which made him utter  exclamation  surprise “why”  cried pointing   grass  few feet away “who did  there” it  one  mary’s own little clearings round  pale green points “i did it” said mary “why i thought tha’ didn’t know nothin’ about gardenin’”  exclaimed “i don’t” she answered “but they  so little   grass  so thick  strong  they looked  if they had no room  breathe so i made  place  them i don’t even know what they are” dickon went  knelt down  them smiling his wide smile “tha’  right”  said “a gardener couldn’t have told thee better they’ll grow now like jack’s beanstalk they’re crocuses an’ snowdrops an’ these here  narcissuses” turning  another patch “an here’s daffydowndillys eh they    sight” he ran  one clearing  another “tha’  done  lot o’ work  such  little wench”  said looking her over “i’m growing fatter” said mary “and i’m growing stronger i used always   tired when i dig i’m not tired  all i like  smell  earth when it’s turned up” “it’s rare good  thee”  said nodding his head wisely “there’s naught  nice  th’ smell o’ good clean earth except th’ smell o’ fresh growin’ things when th’ rain falls  ’em i get out  th’ moor many  day when it’s rainin’ an’ i lie under  bush an’ listen  th’ soft swish o’ drops  th’ heather an’ i just sniff an’ sniff my nose end fair quivers like  rabbit’s mother says” “do you never catch cold” inquired mary gazing  him wonderingly she had never seen such  funny boy or such  nice one “not me”  said grinning “i never ketched cold since i  born i wasn’t brought up nesh enough i’ve chased about th’ moor  all weathers same  th’ rabbits does mother says i’ve sniffed up too much fresh air  twelve year’  ever get  sniffin’  cold i’m  tough   whitethorn knobstick” he  working all  time   talking  mary  following him  helping him  her fork or  trowel “there’s  lot  work  do here”  said once looking about quite exultantly “will you come again  help me  do it” mary begged “i’m sure i can help too i can dig  pull up weeds  do whatever you tell me oh do come dickon” “i’ll come every day if tha’ wants me rain or shine”  answered stoutly “it’s  best fun i ever had  my life—shut  here an’ wakenin’ up  garden” “if you  come” said mary “if you  help me  make  alive i’ll—i don’t know what i’ll do” she ended helplessly what could you do   boy like that “i’ll tell thee what tha’ll do” said dickon  his happy grin “tha’ll get fat an’ tha’ll get  hungry   young fox an’ tha’ll learn how  talk  th’ robin same  i do eh we’ll have  lot o’ fun” he began  walk about looking up   trees    walls  bushes   thoughtful expression “i wouldn’t want  make  look like  gardener’s garden all clipped an’ spick an’ span would you”  said “it’s nicer like this  things runnin’ wild an’ swingin’ an’ catchin’ hold  each other” “don’t let us make  tidy” said mary anxiously “it wouldn’t seem like  secret garden if   tidy” dickon stood rubbing his rustyred head   rather puzzled look “it’s  secret garden sure enough”  said “but seems like someone besides th’ robin must have been   since   shut up ten year’ ago” “but  door  locked   key  buried” said mary “no one could get in” “that’s true”  answered “it’s  queer place seems  me  if there’d been  bit o’ prunin’ done here an’ there later than ten year’ ago” “but how could  have been done” said mary he  examining  branch   standard rose   shook his head “aye how could it”  murmured “with th’ door locked an’ th’ key buried” mistress mary always felt  however many years she lived she should never forget  first morning when her garden began  grow of course  did seem  begin  grow  her  morning when dickon began  clear places  plant seeds she remembered what basil had sung  her when  wanted  tease her “are there any flowers  look like bells” she inquired “lilies o’ th’ valley does”  answered digging away   trowel “an’ there’s canterbury bells an’ campanulas” “let’s plant some” said mary “there’s lilies o’ th valley here already i saw ’em they’ll have growed too close an’ we’ll have  separate ’em but there’s plenty th’ other ones takes two years  bloom  seed but i can bring you some bits o’ plants  our cottage garden why does tha’ want ’em” then mary told him about basil  his brothers  sisters  india   how she had hated them   their calling her “mistress mary quite contrary” “they used  dance round  sing  me they sang— ‘mistress mary quite contrary how does your garden grow with silver bells  cockle shells and marigolds all   row’ i just remembered    made me wonder if there  really flowers like silver bells” she frowned  little  gave her trowel  rather spiteful dig into  earth “i wasn’t  contrary  they were” but dickon laughed “eh”  said    crumbled  rich black soil she saw   sniffing up  scent  it “there doesn’t seem   no need  no one   contrary when there’s flowers an’ such like an’ such lots o’ friendly wild things runnin’ about makin’ homes  themselves or buildin’ nests an’ singin’ an’ whistlin’ does there” mary kneeling  him holding  seeds looked  him  stopped frowning “dickon” she said “you   nice  martha said you were i like you  you make  fifth person i never thought i should like five people” dickon sat up  his heels  martha did when she  polishing  grate he did look funny  delightful mary thought  his round blue eyes  red cheeks  happy looking turnedup nose “only five folk  tha’ likes”  said “who  th’ other four” “your mother  martha” mary checked them off  her fingers “and  robin  ben weatherstaff” dickon laughed so    obliged  stifle  sound  putting his arm over his mouth “i know tha’ thinks i’m  queer lad”  said “but i think tha’ art th’ queerest little lass i ever saw” then mary did  strange thing she leaned forward  asked him  question she had never dreamed  asking anyone before and she tried  ask   yorkshire because   his language   india  native  always pleased if you knew his speech “does tha’ like me” she said “eh”  answered heartily “that i does i likes thee wonderful an’ so does th’ robin i do believe” “that’s two then” said mary “that’s two  me” and then they began  work harder than ever  more joyfully mary  startled  sorry when she heard  big clock   courtyard strike  hour  her midday dinner “i shall have  go” she said mournfully “and you  have  go too won’t you” dickon grinned “my dinner’s easy  carry about  me”  said “mother always lets me put  bit o’ somethin’  my pocket” he picked up his coat   grass  brought out   pocket  lumpy little bundle tied up   quite clean coarse blue  white handkerchief it held two thick pieces  bread   slice  something laid between them “it’s oftenest naught but bread”  said “but i’ve got  fine slice o’ fat bacon   today” mary thought  looked  queer dinner but  seemed ready  enjoy it “run  an’ get thy victuals”  said “i’ll  done  mine first i’ll get some more work done before i start back home” he sat down  his back against  tree “i’ll call th’ robin up”  said “and give him th’ rind o’ th’ bacon  peck at they likes  bit o’ fat wonderful” mary could scarcely bear  leave him suddenly  seemed  if  might   sort  wood fairy who might  gone when she came into  garden again he seemed too good   true she went slowly halfway   door   wall  then she stopped  went back “whatever happens you—you never would tell” she said his poppycolored cheeks  distended  his first big bite  bread  bacon but  managed  smile encouragingly “if tha’   missel thrush an’ showed me where thy nest was does tha’ think i’d tell anyone not me”  said “tha’ art  safe   missel thrush” and she  quite sure she was chapter xii “might i have a bit of earth” mary ran so fast  she  rather out  breath when she reached her room her hair  ruffled  her forehead  her cheeks  bright pink her dinner  waiting   table  martha  waiting near it “tha’s  bit late” she said “where  tha’ been” “i’ve seen dickon” said mary “i’ve seen dickon” “i knew he’d come” said martha exultantly “how does tha’ like him” “i think—i think he’s beautiful” said mary   determined voice martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased too “well” she said “he’s th’ best lad  ever  born but us never thought   handsome his nose turns up too much” “i like   turn up” said mary “an’ his eyes  so round” said martha  trifle doubtful “though they’re  nice color” “i like them round” said mary “and they  exactly  color   sky over  moor” martha beamed  satisfaction “mother says  made ’em  color  always lookin’ up  th’ birds an’ th’ clouds but   got  big mouth hasn’t he now” “i love his big mouth” said mary obstinately “i wish mine  just like it” martha chuckled delightedly “it’d look rare an’ funny  thy bit   face” she said “but i knowed  would   way when tha’ saw him how did tha’ like th’ seeds an’ th’ garden tools” “how did you know  brought them” asked mary “eh i never thought  him not bringin’ ’em he’d  sure  bring ’em if they   yorkshire he’s such  trusty lad” mary  afraid  she might begin  ask difficult questions but she did not she  very much interested   seeds  gardening tools  there  only one moment when mary  frightened this  when she began  ask where  flowers    planted “who did tha’ ask about it” she inquired “i haven’t asked anybody yet” said mary hesitating “well i wouldn’t ask th’ head gardener he’s too grand mr roach is” “i’ve never seen him” said mary “i’ve only seen undergardeners  ben weatherstaff” “if i  you i’d ask ben weatherstaff” advised martha “he’s not half  bad   looks  all he’s so crabbed mr craven lets him do what  likes because   here when mrs craven  alive an’  used  make her laugh she liked him perhaps he’d find you  corner somewhere out o’  way” “if   out   way  no one wanted it no one could mind my having it could they” mary said anxiously “there wouldn’t  no reason” answered martha “you wouldn’t do no harm” mary ate her dinner  quickly  she could  when she rose   table she  going  run  her room  put  her hat again but martha stopped her “i’ve got somethin’  tell you” she said “i thought i’d let you eat your dinner first mr craven came back this mornin’  i think  wants  see you” mary turned quite pale “oh” she said “why why he didn’t want  see me when i came i heard pitcher say  didn’t” “well” explained martha “mrs medlock says it’s because o’ mother she  walkin’  thwaite village an’ she met him she’d never spoke  him before but mrs craven had been  our cottage two or three times he’d forgot but mother hadn’t an’ she made bold  stop him i don’t know what she said  him about you but she said somethin’  put him  th’ mind  see you before  goes away again tomorrow” “oh” cried mary “is  going away tomorrow i am so glad” “he’s goin’   long time he mayn’t come back till autumn or winter he’s goin’  travel  foreign places he’s always doin’ it” “oh i’m so glad—so glad” said mary thankfully if  did not come back until winter or even autumn there would  time  watch  secret garden come alive even if  found out then  took  away  her she would have had  much  least “when do you think   want  see—” she did not finish  sentence because  door opened  mrs medlock walked in she had  her best black dress  cap  her collar  fastened   large brooch   picture   man’s face  it it   colored photograph  mr medlock who had died years ago  she always wore  when she  dressed up she looked nervous  excited “your hair’s rough” she said quickly “go  brush it martha help her  slip  her best dress mr craven sent me  bring her  him  his study” all  pink left mary’s cheeks her heart began  thump  she felt herself changing into  stiff plain silent child again she did not even answer mrs medlock but turned  walked into her bedroom followed  martha she said nothing while her dress  changed  her hair brushed  after she  quite tidy she followed mrs medlock down  corridors  silence what  there  her  say she  obliged  go  see mr craven   would not like her  she would not like him she knew what  would think  her she  taken   part   house she had not been into before at last mrs medlock knocked   door  when someone said “come in” they entered  room together a man  sitting   armchair before  fire  mrs medlock spoke  him “this  miss mary sir” she said “you can go  leave her here i  ring  you when i want you  take her away” said mr craven when she went out  closed  door mary could only stand waiting  plain little thing twisting her thin hands together she could see   man   chair  not so much  hunchback   man  high rather crooked shoulders   had black hair streaked  white he turned his head over his high shoulders  spoke  her “come here”  said mary went  him he  not ugly his face would have been handsome if  had not been so miserable he looked  if  sight  her worried  fretted him   if  did not know what   world  do  her “are you well”  asked “yes” answered mary “do they take good care  you” “yes” he rubbed his forehead fretfully   looked her over “you  very thin”  said “i am getting fatter” mary answered  what she knew  her stiffest way what  unhappy face  had his black eyes seemed  if they scarcely saw her  if they  seeing something else   could hardly keep his thoughts upon her “i forgot you”  said “how could i remember you i intended  send you  governess or  nurse or someone   sort but i forgot” “please” began mary “please—”  then  lump  her throat choked her “what do you want  say”  inquired “i am—i am too big   nurse” said mary “and please—please don’t make me have  governess yet” he rubbed his forehead again  stared  her “that  what  sowerby woman said”  muttered absentmindedly then mary gathered  scrap  courage “is she—is she martha’s mother” she stammered “yes i think so”  replied “she knows about children” said mary “she  twelve she knows” he seemed  rouse himself “what do you want  do” “i want  play out  doors” mary answered hoping  her voice did not tremble “i never liked   india it makes me hungry here  i am getting fatter” he  watching her “mrs sowerby said  would do you good perhaps  will”  said “she thought you had better get stronger before you had  governess” “it makes me feel strong when i play   wind comes over  moor” argued mary “where do you play”  asked next “everywhere” gasped mary “martha’s mother sent me  skippingrope i skip  run—and i look about  see if things  beginning  stick up out   earth i don’t do any harm” “don’t look so frightened”  said   worried voice “you could not do any harm  child like you you may do what you like” mary put her hand up  her throat because she  afraid  might see  excited lump which she felt jump into it she came  step nearer  him “may i” she said tremulously her anxious little face seemed  worry him more than ever “don’t look so frightened”  exclaimed “of course you may i am your guardian though i am  poor one  any child i cannot give you time or attention i am too ill  wretched  distracted but i wish you   happy  comfortable i don’t know anything about children but mrs medlock   see  you have all you need i sent  you today because mrs sowerby said i ought  see you her daughter had talked about you she thought you needed fresh air  freedom  running about” “she knows all about children” mary said again  spite  herself “she ought to” said mr craven “i thought her rather bold  stop me   moor but she said—mrs craven had been kind  her” it seemed hard  him  speak his dead wife’s name “she   respectable woman now i have seen you i think she said sensible things play out  doors  much  you like it’s  big place  you may go where you like  amuse yourself  you like is there anything you want”  if  sudden thought had struck him “do you want toys books dolls” “might i” quavered mary “might i have  bit  earth” in her eagerness she did not realize how queer  words would sound   they  not  ones she had meant  say mr craven looked quite startled “earth”  repeated “what do you mean” “to plant seeds in—to make things grow—to see them come alive” mary faltered he gazed  her  moment  then passed his hand quickly over his eyes “do you—care about gardens so much”  said slowly “i didn’t know about them  india” said mary “i  always ill  tired    too hot i sometimes made little beds   sand  stuck flowers  them but here   different” mr craven got up  began  walk slowly across  room “a bit  earth”  said  himself  mary thought  somehow she must have reminded him  something when  stopped  spoke  her his dark eyes looked almost soft  kind “you can have  much earth  you want”  said “you remind me  someone else who loved  earth  things  grow when you see  bit  earth you want”  something like  smile “take it child  make  come alive” “may i take   anywhere—if it’s not wanted” “anywhere”  answered “there you must go now i am tired” he touched  bell  call mrs medlock “goodby i shall  away all summer” mrs medlock came so quickly  mary thought she must have been waiting   corridor “mrs medlock” mr craven said  her “now i have seen  child i understand what mrs sowerby meant she must  less delicate before she begins lessons give her simple healthy food let her run wild   garden don’t look after her too much she needs liberty  fresh air  romping about mrs sowerby   come  see her now  then  she may sometimes go   cottage” mrs medlock looked pleased she  relieved  hear  she need not “look after” mary too much she had felt her  tiresome charge  had indeed seen  little  her  she dared in addition  this she  fond  martha’s mother “thank you sir” she said “susan sowerby  me went  school together  she’s  sensible  goodhearted  woman  you’d find   day’s walk i never had any children myself  she’s had twelve  there never  healthier or better ones miss mary can get no harm  them i’d always take susan sowerby’s advice about children myself she’s what you might call healthyminded—if you understand me” “i understand” mr craven answered “take miss mary away now  send pitcher  me” when mrs medlock left her   end  her own corridor mary flew back  her room she found martha waiting there martha had  fact hurried back after she had removed  dinner service “i can have my garden” cried mary “i may have  where i like i am not going  have  governess   long time your mother  coming  see me  i may go  your cottage he says  little girl like me could not do any harm  i may do what i like—anywhere” “eh” said martha delightedly “that  nice  him wasn’t it” “martha” said mary solemnly “he  really  nice man only his face  so miserable  his forehead  all drawn together” she ran  quickly  she could   garden she had been away so much longer than she had thought she should  she knew dickon would have  set out early  his fivemile walk when she slipped through  door under  ivy she saw   not working where she had left him the gardening tools  laid together under  tree she ran  them looking all round  place but there  no dickon   seen he had gone away   secret garden  empty—except   robin who had just flown across  wall  sat   standard rosebush watching her “he’s gone” she said woefully “oh  he—was he—was  only  wood fairy” something white fastened   standard rosebush caught her eye it   piece  paper  fact    piece   letter she had printed  martha  send  dickon it  fastened   bush   long thorn    minute she knew dickon had left  there there  some roughly printed letters     sort  picture at first she could not tell what  was then she saw   meant   nest   bird sitting  it underneath   printed letters  they said “i  cum bak” chapter xiii “i am colin” mary took  picture back   house when she went  her supper  she showed   martha “eh” said martha  great pride “i never knew our dickon   clever  that that there’s  picture   missel thrush  her nest  large  life an’ twice  natural” then mary knew dickon had meant  picture    message he had meant  she might  sure  would keep her secret her garden  her nest  she  like  missel thrush oh how she did like  queer common boy she hoped  would come back  very next day  she fell asleep looking forward   morning but you never know what  weather  do  yorkshire particularly   springtime she  awakened   night   sound  rain beating  heavy drops against her window it  pouring down  torrents   wind  “wuthering” round  corners    chimneys   huge old house mary sat up  bed  felt miserable  angry “the rain   contrary  i ever was” she said “it came because  knew i did not want it” she threw herself back  her pillow  buried her face she did not cry but she lay  hated  sound   heavily beating rain she hated  wind   “wuthering” she could not go  sleep again the mournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself if she had felt happy  would probably have lulled her  sleep how  “wuthered”  how  big raindrops poured down  beat against  pane “it sounds just like  person lost   moor  wandering    crying” she said she had been lying awake turning  side  side  about  hour when suddenly something made her sit up  bed  turn her head toward  door listening she listened  she listened “it isn’t  wind now” she said   loud whisper “that isn’t  wind it  different it   crying i heard before” the door  her room  ajar   sound came down  corridor  faroff faint sound  fretful crying she listened   few minutes  each minute she became more  more sure she felt  if she must find out what  was it seemed even stranger than  secret garden   buried key perhaps  fact  she    rebellious mood made her bold she put her foot out  bed  stood   floor “i am going  find out what  is” she said “everybody   bed  i don’t care about mrs medlock—i don’t care” there   candle  her bedside  she took  up  went softly out   room the corridor looked very long  dark but she  too excited  mind that she thought she remembered  corners she must turn  find  short corridor   door covered  tapestry—the one mrs medlock had come through  day she lost herself the sound had come up  passage so she went   her dim light almost feeling her way her heart beating so loud  she fancied she could hear it the faroff faint crying went   led her sometimes  stopped   moment or so  then began again was this  right corner  turn she stopped  thought yes  was down this passage  then   left  then up two broad steps  then   right again yes there   tapestry door she pushed  open very gently  closed  behind her  she stood   corridor  could hear  crying quite plainly though   not loud it    other side   wall  her left   few yards farther  there   door she could see  glimmer  light coming  beneath it the someone  crying   room    quite  young someone so she walked   door  pushed  open  there she  standing   room it   big room  ancient handsome furniture  it there   low fire glowing faintly   hearth   night light burning   side   carved fourposted bed hung  brocade    bed  lying  boy crying fretfully mary wondered if she    real place or if she had fallen asleep again   dreaming without knowing it the boy had  sharp delicate face  color  ivory   seemed  have eyes too big  it he had also  lot  hair which tumbled over his forehead  heavy locks  made his thin face seem smaller he looked like  boy who had been ill but   crying more  if   tired  cross than  if    pain mary stood near  door  her candle  her hand holding her breath then she crept across  room and  she drew nearer  light attracted  boy’s attention   turned his head  his pillow  stared  her his gray eyes opening so wide  they seemed immense “who  you”  said  last   halffrightened whisper “are you  ghost” “no i am not” mary answered her own whisper sounding half frightened “are you one” he stared  stared  stared mary could not help noticing what strange eyes  had they  agate gray  they looked too big  his face because they had black lashes all round them “no”  replied after waiting  moment or so “i am colin” “who  colin” she faltered “i am colin craven who  you” “i am mary lennox mr craven  my uncle” “he  my father” said  boy “your father” gasped mary “no one ever told me  had  boy why didn’t they” “come here”  said still keeping his strange eyes fixed  her   anxious expression she came close   bed   put out his hand  touched her “you  real aren’t you”  said “i have such real dreams very often you might  one  them” mary had slipped   woolen wrapper before she left her room  she put  piece   between his fingers “rub   see how thick  warm  is” she said “i  pinch you  little if you like  show you how real i am for  minute i thought you might   dream too” “where did you come from”  asked “from my own room the wind wuthered so i couldn’t go  sleep  i heard someone crying  wanted  find out who  was what  you crying for” “because i couldn’t go  sleep either  my head ached tell me your name again” “mary lennox did no one ever tell you i had come  live here” he  still fingering  fold  her wrapper but  began  look  little more  if  believed  her reality “no”  answered “they daren’t” “why” asked mary “because i should have been afraid you would see me i won’t let people see me  talk me over” “why” mary asked again feeling more mystified every moment “because i am like this always ill  having  lie down my father won’t let people talk me over either the servants  not allowed  speak about me if i live i may   hunchback but i shan’t live my father hates  think i may  like him” “oh what  queer house this is” mary said “what  queer house everything   kind  secret rooms  locked up  gardens  locked up—and you have you been locked up” “no i stay  this room because i don’t want   moved out  it it tires me too much” “does your father come  see you” mary ventured “sometimes generally when i am asleep he doesn’t want  see me” “why” mary could not help asking again a sort  angry shadow passed over  boy’s face “my mother died when i  born   makes him wretched  look  me he thinks i don’t know but i’ve heard people talking he almost hates me” “he hates  garden because she died” said mary half speaking  herself “what garden”  boy asked “oh just—just  garden she used  like” mary stammered “have you been here always” “nearly always sometimes i have been taken  places   seaside but i won’t stay because people stare  me i used  wear  iron thing  keep my back straight but  grand doctor came  london  see me  said   stupid he told them  take  off  keep me out   fresh air i hate fresh air  i don’t want  go out” “i didn’t when first i came here” said mary “why do you keep looking  me like that” “because   dreams   so real”  answered rather fretfully “sometimes when i open my eyes i don’t believe i’m awake” “we’re both awake” said mary she glanced round  room   high ceiling  shadowy corners  dim firelight “it looks quite like  dream  it’s  middle   night  everybody   house  asleep—everybody but us we  wide awake” “i don’t want     dream”  boy said restlessly mary thought  something all  once “if you don’t like people  see you” she began “do you want me  go away” he still held  fold  her wrapper   gave   little pull “no”  said “i should  sure you   dream if you went if you  real sit down   big footstool  talk i want  hear about you” mary put down her candle   table near  bed  sat down   cushioned stool she did not want  go away  all she wanted  stay   mysterious hiddenaway room  talk   mysterious boy “what do you want me  tell you” she said he wanted  know how long she had been  misselthwaite  wanted  know which corridor her room  on  wanted  know what she had been doing if she disliked  moor   disliked it where she had lived before she came  yorkshire she answered all these questions  many more   lay back  his pillow  listened he made her tell him  great deal about india  about her voyage across  ocean she found out  because  had been  invalid  had not learned things  other children had one  his nurses had taught him  read when   quite little    always reading  looking  pictures  splendid books though his father rarely saw him when   awake   given all sorts  wonderful things  amuse himself with he never seemed  have been amused however he could have anything  asked    never made  do anything  did not like  do “everyone  obliged  do what pleases me”  said indifferently “it makes me ill   angry no one believes i shall live  grow up” he said   if   so accustomed   idea   had ceased  matter  him  all he seemed  like  sound  mary’s voice as she went  talking  listened   drowsy interested way once or twice she wondered if   not gradually falling into  doze but  last  asked  question which opened up  new subject “how old  you”  asked “i am ten” answered mary forgetting herself   moment “and so  you” “how do you know that”  demanded   surprised voice “because when you  born  garden door  locked   key  buried and   been locked  ten years” colin half sat up turning toward her leaning  his elbows “what garden door  locked who did it where   key buried”  exclaimed  if   suddenly very much interested “it—it   garden mr craven hates” said mary nervously “he locked  door no one—no one knew where  buried  key” “what sort   garden  it” colin persisted eagerly “no one  been allowed  go into   ten years”  mary’s careful answer but   too late   careful he  too much like herself he too had had nothing  think about   idea   hidden garden attracted him   had attracted her he asked question after question where  it had she never looked   door had she never asked  gardeners “they won’t talk about it” said mary “i think they have been told not  answer questions” “i would make them” said colin “could you” mary faltered beginning  feel frightened if  could make people answer questions who knew what might happen “everyone  obliged  please me i told you that”  said “if i   live this place would sometime belong  me they all know that i would make them tell me” mary had not known  she herself had been spoiled but she could see quite plainly  this mysterious boy had been he thought   whole world belonged  him how peculiar    how coolly  spoke  not living “do you think you won’t live” she asked partly because she  curious  partly  hope  making him forget  garden “i don’t suppose i shall”  answered  indifferently   had spoken before “ever since i remember anything i have heard people say i shan’t at first they thought i  too little  understand  now they think i don’t hear but i do my doctor  my father’s cousin he  quite poor  if i die   have all misselthwaite when my father  dead i should think  wouldn’t want me  live” “do you want  live” inquired mary “no”  answered   cross tired fashion “but i don’t want  die when i feel ill i lie here  think about  until i cry  cry” “i have heard you crying three times” mary said “but i did not know who  was were you crying about that” she did so want him  forget  garden “i dare say”  answered “let us talk about something else talk about  garden don’t you want  see it” “yes” answered mary  quite  low voice “i do”  went  persistently “i don’t think i ever really wanted  see anything before but i want  see  garden i want  key dug up i want  door unlocked i would let them take me there  my chair that would  getting fresh air i am going  make them open  door” he had become quite excited  his strange eyes began  shine like stars  looked more immense than ever “they have  please me”  said “i  make them take me there  i  let you go too” mary’s hands clutched each other everything would  spoiled—everything dickon would never come back she would never again feel like  missel thrush   safehidden nest “oh don’t—don’t—don’t—don’t do that” she cried out he stared  if  thought she had gone crazy “why”  exclaimed “you said you wanted  see it” “i do” she answered almost   sob  her throat “but if you make them open  door  take you  like    never   secret again” he leaned still farther forward “a secret”  said “what do you mean tell me” mary’s words almost tumbled over one another “you see—you see” she panted “if no one knows but ourselves—if there   door hidden somewhere under  ivy—if there was—and we could find it  if we could slip through  together  shut  behind us  no one knew anyone  inside  we called  our garden  pretended that—that we  missel thrushes    our nest  if we played there almost every day  dug  planted seeds  made  all come alive—” “is  dead”  interrupted her “it soon   if no one cares  it” she went on “the bulbs  live but  roses—” he stopped her again  excited  she  herself “what  bulbs”  put  quickly “they  daffodils  lilies  snowdrops they  working   earth now—pushing up pale green points because  spring  coming” “is  spring coming”  said “what   like you don’t see   rooms if you  ill” “it   sun shining   rain   rain falling   sunshine  things pushing up  working under  earth” said mary “if  garden   secret  we could get into  we could watch  things grow bigger every day  see how many roses  alive don’t you see oh don’t you see how much nicer  would  if    secret” he dropped back  his pillow  lay there   odd expression  his face “i never had  secret”  said “except  one about not living  grow up they don’t know i know that so    sort  secret but i like this kind better” “if you won’t make them take you   garden” pleaded mary “perhaps—i feel almost sure i can find out how  get  sometime and then—if  doctor wants you  go out  your chair  if you can always do what you want  do perhaps—perhaps we might find some boy who would push you  we could go alone   would always   secret garden” “i should—like—that”  said very slowly his eyes looking dreamy “i should like that i should not mind fresh air   secret garden” mary began  recover her breath  feel safer because  idea  keeping  secret seemed  please him she felt almost sure  if she kept  talking  could make him see  garden  his mind  she had seen   would like  so much   could not bear  think  everybody might tramp    when they chose “i’ll tell you what i think  would  like if we could go into it” she said “it  been shut up so long things have grown into  tangle perhaps” he lay quite still  listened while she went  talking about  roses which might have clambered  tree  tree  hung down—about  many birds which might have built their nests there because   so safe and then she told him about  robin  ben weatherstaff  there  so much  tell about  robin    so easy  safe  talk about   she ceased   afraid the robin pleased him so much   smiled until  looked almost beautiful   first mary had thought    even plainer than herself  his big eyes  heavy locks  hair “i did not know birds could  like that”  said “but if you stay   room you never see things what  lot  things you know i feel  if you had been inside  garden” she did not know what  say so she did not say anything he evidently did not expect  answer   next moment  gave her  surprise “i am going  let you look  something”  said “do you see  rosecolored silk curtain hanging   wall over  mantelpiece” mary had not noticed  before but she looked up  saw it it   curtain  soft silk hanging over what seemed   some picture “yes” she answered “there   cord hanging  it” said colin “go  pull it” mary got up much mystified  found  cord when she pulled   silk curtain ran back  rings  when  ran back  uncovered  picture it   picture   girl   laughing face she had bright hair tied up   blue ribbon  her gay lovely eyes  exactly like colin’s unhappy ones agate gray  looking twice  big  they really  because   black lashes all round them “she  my mother” said colin complainingly “i don’t see why she died sometimes i hate her  doing it” “how queer” said mary “if she had lived i believe i should not have been ill always”  grumbled “i dare say i should have lived too and my father would not have hated  look  me i dare say i should have had  strong back draw  curtain again” mary did  she  told  returned  her footstool “she  much prettier than you” she said “but her eyes  just like yours—at least they   same shape  color why   curtain drawn over her” he moved uncomfortably “i made them do it”  said “sometimes i don’t like  see her looking  me she smiles too much when i am ill  miserable besides she  mine  i don’t want everyone  see her” there   few moments  silence  then mary spoke “what would mrs medlock do if she found out  i had been here” she inquired “she would do  i told her  do”  answered “and i should tell her  i wanted you  come here  talk  me every day i am glad you came” “so am i” said mary “i  come  often  i can but”—she hesitated—“i shall have  look every day   garden door” “yes you must” said colin “and you can tell me about  afterward” he lay thinking  few minutes   had done before  then  spoke again “i think you shall   secret too”  said “i  not tell them until they find out i can always send  nurse out   room  say  i want    myself do you know martha” “yes i know her very well” said mary “she waits  me” he nodded his head toward  outer corridor “she   one who  asleep   other room the nurse went away yesterday  stay all night  her sister  she always makes martha attend  me when she wants  go out martha shall tell you when  come here” then mary understood martha’s troubled look when she had asked questions about  crying “martha knew about you all  time” she said “yes she often attends  me the nurse likes  get away  me  then martha comes” “i have been here  long time” said mary “shall i go away now your eyes look sleepy” “i wish i could go  sleep before you leave me”  said rather shyly “shut your eyes” said mary drawing her footstool closer “and i  do what my ayah used  do  india i  pat your hand  stroke   sing something quite low” “i should like  perhaps”  said drowsily somehow she  sorry  him  did not want him  lie awake so she leaned against  bed  began  stroke  pat his hand  sing  very low little chanting song  hindustani “that  nice”  said more drowsily still  she went  chanting  stroking but when she looked  him again his black lashes  lying close against his cheeks  his eyes  shut    fast asleep so she got up softly took her candle  crept away without making  sound chapter xiv a young rajah the moor  hidden  mist when  morning came   rain had not stopped pouring down there could  no going out  doors martha  so busy  mary had no opportunity  talking  her but   afternoon she asked her  come  sit  her   nursery she came bringing  stocking she  always knitting when she  doing nothing else “what’s  matter  thee” she asked  soon  they sat down “tha’ looks  if tha’d somethin’  say” “i have i have found out what  crying was” said mary martha let her knitting drop  her knee  gazed  her  startled eyes “tha’ hasn’t” she exclaimed “never” “i heard    night” mary went on “and i got up  went  see where  came from it  colin i found him” martha’s face became red  fright “eh miss mary” she said half crying “tha’ shouldn’t have done it—tha’ shouldn’t tha’ll get me  trouble i never told thee nothin’ about him—but tha’ll get me  trouble i shall lose my place  what’ll mother do” “you won’t lose your place” said mary “he  glad i came we talked  talked   said   glad i came” “was he” cried martha “art tha’ sure tha’ doesn’t know what he’s like when anything vexes him he’s  big lad  cry like  baby but when he’s   passion he’ll fair scream just  frighten us he knows us daren’t call our souls our own” “he wasn’t vexed” said mary “i asked him if i should go away   made me stay he asked me questions  i sat   big footstool  talked  him about india  about  robin  gardens he wouldn’t let me go he let me see his mother’s picture before i left him i sang him  sleep” martha fairly gasped  amazement “i can scarcely believe thee” she protested “it’s  if tha’d walked straight into  lion’s den if he’d been like   most times he’d have throwed himself into one  his tantrums  roused th’ house he won’t let strangers look  him” “he let me look  him i looked  him all  time   looked  me we stared” said mary “i don’t know what  do” cried agitated martha “if mrs medlock finds out she’ll think i broke orders  told thee  i shall  packed back  mother” “he  not going  tell mrs medlock anything about  yet it’s    sort  secret just  first” said mary firmly “and  says everybody  obliged  do   pleases” “aye that’s true enough—th’ bad lad” sighed martha wiping her forehead  her apron “he says mrs medlock must and  wants me  come  talk  him every day and you   tell me when  wants me” “me” said martha “i shall lose my place—i shall  sure” “you can’t if you  doing what  wants you  do  everybody  ordered  obey him” mary argued “does tha’ mean  say” cried martha  wide open eyes “that   nice  thee” “i think  almost liked me” mary answered “then tha’ must have bewitched him” decided martha drawing  long breath “do you mean magic” inquired mary “i’ve heard about magic  india but i can’t make it i just went into his room  i  so surprised  see him i stood  stared and then  turned round  stared  me and  thought i   ghost or  dream  i thought perhaps  was and   so queer being there alone together   middle   night  not knowing about each other and we began  ask each other questions and when i asked him if i must go away  said i must not” “th’ world’s comin’   end” gasped martha “what   matter  him” asked mary “nobody knows  sure  certain” said martha “mr craven went off his head like when   born th’ doctors thought he’d have   put   ’sylum it  because mrs craven died like i told you he wouldn’t set eyes  th’ baby he just raved  said it’d  another hunchback like him  it’d better die” “is colin  hunchback” mary asked “he didn’t look like one” “he isn’t yet” said martha “but  began all wrong mother said  there  enough trouble  raging  th’ house  set any child wrong they  afraid his back  weak an’ they’ve always been takin’ care  it—keepin’ him lyin’ down  not lettin’ him walk once they made him wear  brace but  fretted so   downright ill then  big doctor came  see him an’ made them take  off he talked  th’ other doctor quite rough—in  polite way he said there’d been too much medicine  too much lettin’ him have his own way” “i think he’s  very spoiled boy” said mary “he’s th’ worst young nowt  ever was” said martha “i won’t say   hasn’t been ill  good bit he’s had coughs an’ colds that’s nearly killed him two or three times once  had rheumatic fever an’ once  had typhoid eh mrs medlock did get  fright then he’d been out  his head an’ she  talkin’  th’ nurse thinkin’  didn’t know nothin’ an’ she said ‘he’ll die this time sure enough an’ best thing  him an’  everybody’ an’ she looked  him an’ there    his big eyes open starin’  her  sensible  she  herself she didn’t know wha’d happen but  just stared  her an’ says ‘you give me some water an’ stop talkin’’” “do you think   die” asked mary “mother says there’s no reason why any child should live  gets no fresh air an’ doesn’t do nothin’ but lie  his back an’ read picturebooks an’ take medicine he’s weak  hates th’ trouble o’ bein’ taken out o’ doors an’  gets cold so easy  says  makes him ill” mary sat  looked   fire “i wonder” she said slowly “if  would not do him good  go out into  garden  watch things growing it did me good” “one  th’ worst fits  ever had” said martha “was one time they took him out where  roses    fountain he’d been readin’   paper about people gettin’ somethin’  called ‘rose cold’ an’  began  sneeze an’ said he’d got  an’ then  new gardener  didn’t know th’ rules passed  an’ looked  him curious he threw himself into  passion an’  said he’d looked  him because   going    hunchback he cried himself into  fever an’  ill all night” “if  ever gets angry  me i’ll never go  see him again” said mary “he’ll have thee if  wants thee” said martha “tha’ may  well know   th’ start” very soon afterward  bell rang  she rolled up her knitting “i dare say th’ nurse wants me  stay  him  bit” she said “i hope he’s   good temper” she  out   room about ten minutes  then she came back   puzzled expression “well tha’  bewitched him” she said “he’s up  his sofa  his picturebooks he’s told  nurse  stay away until six o’clock i’m  wait   next room th’ minute she  gone  called me  him an’ says ‘i want mary lennox  come  talk  me  remember you’re not  tell anyone’ you’d better go  quick  you can” mary  quite willing  go quickly she did not want  see colin  much  she wanted  see dickon but she wanted  see him very much there   bright fire   hearth when she entered his room    daylight she saw    very beautiful room indeed there  rich colors   rugs  hangings  pictures  books   walls which made  look glowing  comfortable even  spite   gray sky  falling rain colin looked rather like  picture himself he  wrapped   velvet dressinggown  sat against  big brocaded cushion he had  red spot  each cheek “come in”  said “i’ve been thinking about you all morning” “i’ve been thinking about you too” answered mary “you don’t know how frightened martha is she says mrs medlock  think she told me about you  then she   sent away” he frowned “go  tell her  come here”  said “she    next room” mary went  brought her back poor martha  shaking  her shoes colin  still frowning “have you  do what i please or have you not”  demanded “i have  do what you please sir” martha faltered turning quite red “has medlock  do what i please” “everybody has sir” said martha “well then if i order you  bring miss mary  me how can medlock send you away if she finds  out” “please don’t let her sir” pleaded martha “i’ll send her away if she dares  say  word about such  thing” said master craven grandly “she wouldn’t like that i can tell you” “thank you sir” bobbing  curtsy “i want  do my duty sir” “what i want  your duty” said colin more grandly still “i’ll take care  you now go away” when  door closed behind martha colin found mistress mary gazing  him  if  had set her wondering “why do you look  me like that”  asked her “what  you thinking about” “i am thinking about two things” “what  they sit down  tell me” “this   first one” said mary seating herself   big stool “once  india i saw  boy who   rajah he had rubies  emeralds  diamonds stuck all over him he spoke  his people just  you spoke  martha everybody had  do everything  told them—in  minute i think they would have been killed if they hadn’t” “i shall make you tell me about rajahs presently”  said “but first tell me what  second thing was” “i  thinking” said mary “how different you   dickon” “who  dickon”  said “what  queer name” she might  well tell him she thought she could talk about dickon without mentioning  secret garden she had liked  hear martha talk about him besides she longed  talk about him it would seem  bring him nearer “he  martha’s brother he  twelve years old” she explained “he  not like anyone else   world he can charm foxes  squirrels  birds just   natives  india charm snakes he plays  very soft tune   pipe  they come  listen” there  some big books   table  his side   dragged one suddenly toward him “there   picture   snakecharmer  this”  exclaimed “come  look  it” the book   beautiful one  superb colored illustrations   turned  one  them “can  do that”  asked eagerly “he played  his pipe  they listened” mary explained “but  doesn’t call  magic he says it’s because  lives   moor so much   knows their ways he says  feels sometimes  if    bird or  rabbit himself  likes them so i think  asked  robin questions it seemed  if they talked  each other  soft chirps” colin lay back  his cushion  his eyes grew larger  larger   spots  his cheeks burned “tell me some more about him”  said “he knows all about eggs  nests” mary went on “and  knows where foxes  badgers  otters live he keeps them secret so  other boys won’t find their holes  frighten them he knows about everything  grows or lives   moor” “does  like  moor” said colin “how can  when it’s such  great bare dreary place” “it’s  most beautiful place” protested mary “thousands  lovely things grow    there  thousands  little creatures all busy building nests  making holes  burrows  chippering or singing or squeaking  each other they  so busy  having such fun under  earth or   trees or heather it’s their world” “how do you know all that” said colin turning  his elbow  look  her “i have never been there once really” said mary suddenly remembering “i only drove over    dark i thought   hideous martha told me about  first  then dickon when dickon talks about  you feel  if you saw things  heard them   if you  standing   heather   sun shining   gorse smelling like honey—and all full  bees  butterflies” “you never see anything if you  ill” said colin restlessly he looked like  person listening   new sound   distance  wondering what  was “you can’t if you stay   room” said mary “i couldn’t go   moor”  said   resentful tone mary  silent   minute  then she said something bold “you might—sometime” he moved  if   startled “go   moor how could i i am going  die” “how do you know” said mary unsympathetically she didn’t like  way  had  talking about dying she did not feel very sympathetic she felt rather  if  almost boasted about it “oh i’ve heard  ever since i remember”  answered crossly “they  always whispering about   thinking i don’t notice they wish i would too” mistress mary felt quite contrary she pinched her lips together “if they wished i would” she said “i wouldn’t who wishes you would” “the servants—and  course dr craven because  would get misselthwaite   rich instead  poor he daren’t say so but  always looks cheerful when i am worse when i had typhoid fever his face got quite fat i think my father wishes it too” “i don’t believe  does” said mary quite obstinately that made colin turn  look  her again “don’t you”  said and then  lay back  his cushion   still  if   thinking and there  quite  long silence perhaps they  both  them thinking strange things children do not usually think of “i like  grand doctor  london because  made them take  iron thing off” said mary  last “did  say you  going  die” “no” “what did  say” “he didn’t whisper” colin answered “perhaps  knew i hated whispering i heard him say one thing quite aloud he said ‘the lad might live if  would make up his mind  it put him   humor’ it sounded  if     temper” “i’ll tell you who would put you   humor perhaps” said mary reflecting she felt  if she would like this thing   settled one way or  other “i believe dickon would he’s always talking about live things he never talks about dead things or things   ill he’s always looking up   sky  watch birds flying—or looking down   earth  see something growing he  such round blue eyes  they  so wide open  looking about and  laughs such  big laugh  his wide mouth—and his cheeks   red—as red  cherries” she pulled her stool nearer   sofa  her expression quite changed   remembrance   wide curving mouth  wide open eyes “see here” she said “don’t let us talk about dying i don’t like it let us talk about living let us talk  talk about dickon and then we  look  your pictures” it   best thing she could have said to talk about dickon meant  talk about  moor  about  cottage   fourteen people who lived    sixteen shillings  week—and  children who got fat   moor grass like  wild ponies and about dickon’s mother—and  skippingrope—and  moor   sun  it—and about pale green points sticking up out   black sod and   all so alive  mary talked more than she had ever talked before—and colin both talked  listened   had never done either before and they both began  laugh over nothings  children  when they  happy together and they laughed so    end they  making  much noise  if they had been two ordinary healthy natural tenyearold creatures—instead   hard little unloving girl   sickly boy who believed    going  die they enjoyed themselves so much  they forgot  pictures  they forgot about  time they had been laughing quite loudly over ben weatherstaff  his robin  colin  actually sitting up  if  had forgotten about his weak back when  suddenly remembered something “do you know there  one thing we have never once thought of”  said “we  cousins” it seemed so queer  they had talked so much  never remembered this simple thing  they laughed more than ever because they had got into  humor  laugh  anything and   midst   fun  door opened   walked dr craven  mrs medlock dr craven started  actual alarm  mrs medlock almost fell back because  had accidentally bumped against her “good lord” exclaimed poor mrs medlock  her eyes almost starting out  her head “good lord” “what  this” said dr craven coming forward “what does  mean” then mary  reminded   boy rajah again colin answered  if neither  doctor’s alarm nor mrs medlock’s terror    slightest consequence he   little disturbed or frightened  if  elderly cat  dog had walked into  room “this  my cousin mary lennox”  said “i asked her  come  talk  me i like her she must come  talk  me whenever i send  her” dr craven turned reproachfully  mrs medlock “oh sir” she panted “i don’t know how it’s happened there’s not  servant   place tha’d dare  talk—they all have their orders” “nobody told her anything” said colin “she heard me crying  found me herself i am glad she came don’t  silly medlock” mary saw  dr craven did not look pleased but   quite plain   dare not oppose his patient he sat down  colin  felt his pulse “i am afraid there  been too much excitement excitement  not good  you my boy”  said “i should  excited if she kept away” answered colin his eyes beginning  look dangerously sparkling “i am better she makes me better the nurse must bring up her tea  mine we  have tea together” mrs medlock  dr craven looked  each other   troubled way but there  evidently nothing   done “he does look rather better sir” ventured mrs medlock “but”—thinking  matter over—“he looked better this morning before she came into  room” “she came into  room last night she stayed  me  long time she sang  hindustani song  me   made me go  sleep” said colin “i  better when i wakened up i wanted my breakfast i want my tea now tell nurse medlock” dr craven did not stay very long he talked   nurse   few minutes when she came into  room  said  few words  warning  colin he must not talk too much  must not forget    ill  must not forget    very easily tired mary thought  there seemed    number  uncomfortable things   not  forget colin looked fretful  kept his strange blacklashed eyes fixed  dr craven’s face “i want  forget it”  said  last “she makes me forget it that  why i want her” dr craven did not look happy when  left  room he gave  puzzled glance   little girl sitting   large stool she had become  stiff silent child again  soon   entered   could not see what  attraction was the boy actually did look brighter however—and  sighed rather heavily   went down  corridor “they  always wanting me  eat things when i don’t want to” said colin   nurse brought   tea  put    table   sofa “now if you’ll eat i will those muffins look so nice  hot tell me about rajahs” chapter xv nest building after another week  rain  high arch  blue sky appeared again   sun which poured down  quite hot though there had been no chance  see either  secret garden or dickon mistress mary had enjoyed herself very much the week had not seemed long she had spent hours  every day  colin  his room talking about rajahs or gardens or dickon   cottage   moor they had looked   splendid books  pictures  sometimes mary had read things  colin  sometimes  had read  little  her when   amused  interested she thought  scarcely looked like  invalid  all except  his face  so colorless    always   sofa “you   sly young one  listen  get out  your bed  go following things up like you did  night” mrs medlock said once “but there’s no saying it’s not been  sort  blessing   lot  us he’s not had  tantrum or  whining fit since you made friends the nurse  just going  give up  case because she  so sick  him but she says she doesn’t mind staying now you’ve gone  duty  her” laughing  little in her talks  colin mary had tried   very cautious about  secret garden there  certain things she wanted  find out  him but she felt  she must find them out without asking him direct questions in  first place  she began  like    him she wanted  discover whether    kind  boy you could tell  secret to he  not   least like dickon but   evidently so pleased   idea   garden no one knew anything about  she thought perhaps  could  trusted but she had not known him long enough   sure the second thing she wanted  find out  this if  could  trusted—if  really could—wouldn’t   possible  take him   garden without having anyone find  out the grand doctor had said   must have fresh air  colin had said   would not mind fresh air   secret garden perhaps if  had  great deal  fresh air  knew dickon   robin  saw things growing  might not think so much about dying mary had seen herself   glass sometimes lately when she had realized  she looked quite  different creature   child she had seen when she arrived  india this child looked nicer even martha had seen  change  her “th’ air  th’ moor  done thee good already” she had said “tha’rt not nigh so yeller  tha’rt not nigh so scrawny even tha’ hair doesn’t slamp down  tha’ head so flat it’s got some life   so   sticks out  bit” “it’s like me” said mary “it’s growing stronger  fatter i’m sure there’s more  it” “it looks it  sure” said martha ruffling  up  little round her face “tha’rt not half so ugly when it’s  way an’ there’s  bit o’ red  tha’ cheeks” if gardens  fresh air had been good  her perhaps they would  good  colin but then if  hated people  look  him perhaps  would not like  see dickon “why does  make you angry when you  looked at” she inquired one day “i always hated it”  answered “even when i  very little then when they took me   seaside  i used  lie  my carriage everybody used  stare  ladies would stop  talk  my nurse  then they would begin  whisper  i knew then they  saying i shouldn’t live  grow up then sometimes  ladies would pat my cheeks  say ‘poor child’ once when  lady did  i screamed out loud  bit her hand she  so frightened she ran away” “she thought you had gone mad like  dog” said mary not  all admiringly “i don’t care what she thought” said colin frowning “i wonder why you didn’t scream  bite me when i came into your room” said mary then she began  smile slowly “i thought you   ghost or  dream”  said “you can’t bite  ghost or  dream  if you scream they don’t care” “would you hate  if—if  boy looked  you” mary asked uncertainly he lay back  his cushion  paused thoughtfully “there’s one boy”  said quite slowly  if   thinking over every word “there’s one boy i believe i shouldn’t mind it’s  boy who knows where  foxes live—dickon” “i’m sure you wouldn’t mind him” said mary “the birds don’t  other animals”  said still thinking  over “perhaps that’s why i shouldn’t he’s  sort  animal charmer  i am  boy animal” then  laughed  she laughed too  fact  ended  their both laughing  great deal  finding  idea   boy animal hiding  his hole very funny indeed what mary felt afterward   she need not fear about dickon on  first morning when  sky  blue again mary wakened very early the sun  pouring  slanting rays through  blinds  there  something so joyous   sight    she jumped out  bed  ran   window she drew up  blinds  opened  window itself   great waft  fresh scented air blew  upon her the moor  blue   whole world looked  if something magic had happened  it there  tender little fluting sounds here  there  everywhere  if scores  birds  beginning  tune up   concert mary put her hand out   window  held    sun “it’s warm—warm” she said “it  make  green points push up  up  up    make  bulbs  roots work  struggle  all their might under  earth” she kneeled down  leaned out   window  far  she could breathing big breaths  sniffing  air until she laughed because she remembered what dickon’s mother had said about  end  his nose quivering like  rabbit’s “it must  very early” she said “the little clouds  all pink  i’ve never seen  sky look like this no one  up i don’t even hear  stable boys” a sudden thought made her scramble  her feet “i can’t wait i am going  see  garden” she had learned  dress herself  this time  she put  her clothes  five minutes she knew  small side door which she could unbolt herself  she flew downstairs  her stocking feet  put  her shoes   hall she unchained  unbolted  unlocked  when  door  open she sprang across  step  one bound  there she  standing   grass which seemed  have turned green    sun pouring down  her  warm sweet wafts about her   fluting  twittering  singing coming  every bush  tree she clasped her hands  pure joy  looked up   sky    so blue  pink  pearly  white  flooded  springtime light  she felt  if she must flute  sing aloud herself  knew  thrushes  robins  skylarks could not possibly help it she ran around  shrubs  paths towards  secret garden “it  all different already” she said “the grass  greener  things  sticking up everywhere  things  uncurling  green buds  leaves  showing this afternoon i am sure dickon  come” the long warm rain had done strange things   herbaceous beds which bordered  walk   lower wall there  things sprouting  pushing out   roots  clumps  plants  there  actually here  there glimpses  royal purple  yellow unfurling among  stems  crocuses six months before mistress mary would not have seen how  world  waking up but now she missed nothing when she had reached  place where  door hid itself under  ivy she  startled   curious loud sound it   caw—caw   crow   came   top   wall  when she looked up there sat  big glossyplumaged blueblack bird looking down  her very wisely indeed she had never seen  crow so close before   made her  little nervous but  next moment  spread his wings  flapped away across  garden she hoped   not going  stay inside  she pushed  door open wondering if  would when she got fairly into  garden she saw   probably did intend  stay because  had alighted   dwarf appletree  under  appletree  lying  little reddish animal   bushy tail  both  them  watching  stooping body  rustred head  dickon who  kneeling   grass working hard mary flew across  grass  him “oh dickon dickon” she cried out “how could you get here so early how could you the sun  only just got up” he got up himself laughing  glowing  tousled his eyes like  bit   sky “eh”  said “i  up long before him how could i have stayed abed th’ world’s all fair begun again this mornin’  has an’ it’s workin’ an’ hummin’ an’ scratchin’ an’ pipin’ an’ nestbuildin’ an’ breathin’ out scents till you’ve got   out   ’stead o’ lyin’  your back when th’ sun did jump up th’ moor went mad  joy an’ i    midst  th’ heather an’ i run like mad myself shoutin’ an’ singin’ an’ i come straight here i couldn’t have stayed away why th’ garden  lyin’ here waitin’” mary put her hands  her chest panting  if she had been running herself “oh dickon dickon” she said “i’m so happy i can scarcely breathe” seeing him talking   stranger  little bushytailed animal rose   place under  tree  came  him   rook cawing once flew down   branch  settled quietly  his shoulder “this  th’ little fox cub”  said rubbing  little reddish animal’s head “it’s named captain an’ this here’s soot soot  flew across th’ moor  me an’ captain  run same  if th’ hounds had been after him they both felt same  i did” neither   creatures looked  if    least afraid  mary when dickon began  walk about soot stayed  his shoulder  captain trotted quietly close  his side “see here” said dickon “see how these  pushed up an’ these an’ these an’ eh look  these here” he threw himself upon his knees  mary went down beside him they had come upon  whole clump  crocuses burst into purple  orange  gold mary bent her face down  kissed  kissed them “you never kiss  person   way” she said when she lifted her head “flowers  so different” he looked puzzled but smiled “eh”  said “i’ve kissed mother many  time  way when i come   th’ moor after  day’s roamin’ an’ she stood there  th’ door  th’ sun lookin’ so glad an’ comfortable” they ran  one part   garden  another  found so many wonders  they  obliged  remind themselves  they must whisper or speak low he showed her swelling leafbuds  rose branches which had seemed dead he showed her ten thousand new green points pushing through  mould they put their eager young noses close   earth  sniffed  warmed springtime breathing they dug  pulled  laughed low  rapture until mistress mary’s hair   tumbled  dickon’s  her cheeks  almost  poppy red  his there  every joy  earth   secret garden  morning    midst  them came  delight more delightful than all because   more wonderful swiftly something flew across  wall  darted through  trees   close grown corner  little flare  redbreasted bird  something hanging   beak dickon stood quite still  put his hand  mary almost  if they had suddenly found themselves laughing   church “we munnot stir”  whispered  broad yorkshire “we munnot scarce breathe i knowed   matehuntin’ when i seed him last it’s ben weatherstaff’s robin he’s buildin’ his nest he’ll stay here if us don’t flight him” they settled down softly upon  grass  sat there without moving “us mustn’t seem  if us  watchin’ him too close” said dickon “he’d  out  us  good if  got th’ notion us  interferin’ now he’ll   good bit different till all this  over he’s settin’ up housekeepin’ he’ll  shyer an’ readier  take things ill he’s got no time  visitin’ an’ gossipin’ us must keep still  bit an’ try  look  if us  grass an’ trees an’ bushes then when he’s got used  seein’ us i’ll chirp  bit an’ he’ll know us’ll not   his way” mistress mary  not  all sure  she knew  dickon seemed to how  try  look like grass  trees  bushes but  had said  queer thing  if    simplest  most natural thing   world  she felt  must  quite easy  him  indeed she watched him   few minutes carefully wondering if   possible  him  quietly turn green  put out branches  leaves but  only sat wonderfully still  when  spoke dropped his voice  such  softness    curious  she could hear him but she could “it’s part o’ th’ springtime this nestbuildin’ is”  said “i warrant it’s been goin’   th’ same way every year since th’ world  begun they’ve got their way o’ thinkin’  doin’ things an’  body had better not meddle you can lose  friend  springtime easier than any other season if you’re too curious” “if we talk about him i can’t help looking  him” mary said  softly  possible “we must talk  something else there  something i want  tell you” “he’ll like  better if us talks o’ somethin’ else” said dickon “what   tha’s got  tell me” “well—do you know about colin” she whispered he turned his head  look  her “what does tha’ know about him”  asked “i’ve seen him i have been  talk  him every day this week he wants me  come he says i’m making him forget about being ill  dying” answered mary dickon looked actually relieved  soon   surprise died away  his round face “i am glad o’ that”  exclaimed “i’m right down glad it makes me easier i knowed i must say nothin’ about him an’ i don’t like havin’  hide things” “don’t you like hiding  garden” said mary “i’ll never tell about it”  answered “but i says  mother ‘mother’ i says ‘i got  secret  keep it’s not  bad ’un tha’ knows that it’s no worse than hidin’ where  bird’s nest is tha’ doesn’t mind it does tha’’” mary always wanted  hear about mother “what did she say” she asked not  all afraid  hear dickon grinned sweettemperedly “it  just like her what she said”  answered “she give my head  bit   rub an’ laughed an’ she says ‘eh lad tha’ can have all th’ secrets tha’ likes i’ve knowed thee twelve year’’” “how did you know about colin” asked mary “everybody  knowed about mester craven knowed there   little lad   like    cripple an’ they knowed mester craven didn’t like him   talked about folks  sorry  mester craven because mrs craven  such  pretty young lady an’ they  so fond  each other mrs medlock stops  our cottage whenever she goes  thwaite an’ she doesn’t mind talkin’  mother before us children because she knows us  been brought up   trusty how did tha’ find out about him martha   fine trouble th’ last time she came home she said tha’d heard him frettin’ an’ tha’  askin’ questions an’ she didn’t know what  say” mary told him her story about  midnight wuthering   wind which had wakened her  about  faint faroff sounds   complaining voice which had led her down  dark corridors  her candle  had ended  her opening   door   dimly lighted room   carven fourposted bed   corner when she described  small ivorywhite face   strange blackrimmed eyes dickon shook his head “them’s just like his mother’s eyes only hers  always laughin’ they say”  said “they say  mr craven can’t bear  see him when he’s awake an’ it’s because his eyes  so like his mother’s an’ yet looks so different  his miserable bit   face” “do you think  wants  die” whispered mary “no but  wishes he’d never been born mother she says that’s th’ worst thing  earth   child them   not wanted scarce ever thrives mester craven he’d buy anythin’  money could buy  th’ poor lad but he’d like  forget  he’s  earth for one thing he’s afraid he’ll look  him some day  find he’s growed hunchback” “colin’s so afraid   himself   won’t sit up” said mary “he says he’s always thinking  if  should feel  lump coming  should go crazy  scream himself  death” “eh  oughtn’t  lie there thinkin’ things like that” said dickon “no lad could get well  thought them sort o’ things” the fox  lying   grass close  him looking up  ask   pat now  then  dickon bent down  rubbed his neck softly  thought  few minutes  silence presently  lifted his head  looked round  garden “when first we got  here”  said “it seemed like everything  gray look round now  tell me if tha’ doesn’t see  difference” mary looked  caught her breath  little “why” she cried “the gray wall  changing it   if  green mist  creeping over it it’s almost like  green gauze veil” “aye” said dickon “an’ it’ll  greener  greener till th’ gray’s all gone can tha’ guess what i  thinkin’” “i know   something nice” said mary eagerly “i believe   something about colin” “i  thinkin’  if   out here  wouldn’t  watchin’  lumps  grow  his back he’d  watchin’  buds  break  th’ rosebushes an’ he’d likely  healthier” explained dickon “i  wonderin’ if us could ever get him  th’ humor  come out here an’ lie under th’ trees  his carriage” “i’ve been wondering  myself i’ve thought   almost every time i’ve talked  him” said mary “i’ve wondered if  could keep  secret  i’ve wondered if we could bring him here without anyone seeing us i thought perhaps you could push his carriage the doctor said  must have fresh air  if  wants us  take him out no one dare disobey him he won’t go out  other people  perhaps they   glad if   go out  us he could order  gardeners  keep away so they wouldn’t find out” dickon  thinking very hard   scratched captain’s back “it’d  good  him i’ll warrant”  said “us’d not  thinkin’ he’d better never been born us’d  just two children watchin’  garden grow an’ he’d  another two lads an’  little lass just lookin’   th’ springtime i warrant it’d  better than doctor’s stuff” “he’s been lying  his room so long  he’s always been so afraid  his back    made him queer” said mary “he knows  good many things out  books but  doesn’t know anything else he says   been too ill  notice things   hates going out  doors  hates gardens  gardeners but  likes  hear about this garden because    secret i daren’t tell him much but  said  wanted  see it” “us’ll have him out here sometime  sure” said dickon “i could push his carriage well enough has tha’ noticed how th’ robin an’ his mate  been workin’ while we’ve been sittin’ here look  him perched   branch wonderin’ where it’d  best  put  twig he’s got  his beak” he made one  his low whistling calls   robin turned his head  looked  him inquiringly still holding his twig dickon spoke  him  ben weatherstaff did but dickon’s tone  one  friendly advice “wheres’ever tha’ puts it”  said “it’ll  all right tha’ knew how  build tha’ nest before tha’ came out o’ th’ egg get   thee lad tha’st got no time  lose” “oh i do like  hear you talk  him” mary said laughing delightedly “ben weatherstaff scolds him  makes fun  him   hops about  looks  if  understood every word  i know  likes it ben weatherstaff says   so conceited  would rather have stones thrown  him than not  noticed” dickon laughed too  went  talking “tha’ knows us won’t trouble thee”  said   robin “us  near bein’ wild things ourselves us  nestbuildin’ too bless thee look out tha’ doesn’t tell  us” and though  robin did not answer because his beak  occupied mary knew  when  flew away  his twig  his own corner   garden  darkness  his dewbright eye meant   would not tell their secret   world chapter xvi “i won’t” said mary they found  great deal  do  morning  mary  late  returning   house   also  such  hurry  get back  her work  she quite forgot colin until  last moment “tell colin  i can’t come  see him yet” she said  martha “i’m very busy   garden” martha looked rather frightened “eh miss mary” she said “it may put him all out  humor when i tell him that” but mary  not  afraid  him  other people   she  not  selfsacrificing person “i can’t stay” she answered “dickon’s waiting  me”  she ran away the afternoon  even lovelier  busier than  morning had been already nearly all  weeds  cleared out   garden  most   roses  trees had been pruned or dug about dickon had brought  spade  his own   had taught mary  use all her tools so   this time   plain  though  lovely wild place  not likely  become  “gardener’s garden”  would   wilderness  growing things before  springtime  over “there’ll  apple blossoms an’ cherry blossoms overhead” dickon said working away  all his might “an’ there’ll  peach an’ plum trees  bloom against th’ walls an’ th’ grass’ll   carpet o’ flowers” the little fox   rook   happy  busy  they were   robin  his mate flew backward  forward like tiny streaks  lightning sometimes  rook flapped his black wings  soared away over  treetops   park each time  came back  perched near dickon  cawed several times  if   relating his adventures  dickon talked  him just   had talked   robin once when dickon  so busy   did not answer him  first soot flew   his shoulders  gently tweaked his ear  his large beak when mary wanted  rest  little dickon sat down  her under  tree  once  took his pipe out  his pocket  played  soft strange little notes  two squirrels appeared   wall  looked  listened “tha’s  good bit stronger than tha’ was” dickon said looking  her  she  digging “tha’s beginning  look different  sure” mary  glowing  exercise  good spirits “i’m getting fatter  fatter every day” she said quite exultantly “mrs medlock  have  get me some bigger dresses martha says my hair  growing thicker it isn’t so flat  stringy” the sun  beginning  set  sending deep goldcolored rays slanting under  trees when they parted “it’ll  fine tomorrow” said dickon “i’ll   work  sunrise” “so  i” said mary she ran back   house  quickly  her feet would carry her she wanted  tell colin about dickon’s fox cub   rook  about what  springtime had been doing she felt sure  would like  hear so   not very pleasant when she opened  door  her room  see martha standing waiting  her   doleful face “what   matter” she asked “what did colin say when you told him i couldn’t come” “eh” said martha “i wish tha’d gone he  nigh goin’ into one o’ his tantrums there’s been  nice  do all afternoon  keep him quiet he would watch  clock all th’ time” mary’s lips pinched themselves together she  no more used  considering other people than colin   she saw no reason why  illtempered boy should interfere   thing she liked best she knew nothing about  pitifulness  people who had been ill  nervous  who did not know  they could control their tempers  need not make other people ill  nervous too when she had had  headache  india she had done her best  see  everybody else also had  headache or something quite  bad and she felt she  quite right but  course now she felt  colin  quite wrong he  not  his sofa when she went into his room he  lying flat  his back  bed   did not turn his head toward her  she came in this   bad beginning  mary marched up  him  her stiff manner “why didn’t you get up” she said “i did get up this morning when i thought you  coming”  answered without looking  her “i made them put me back  bed this afternoon my back ached  my head ached  i  tired why didn’t you come” “i  working   garden  dickon” said mary colin frowned  condescended  look  her “i won’t let  boy come here if you go  stay  him instead  coming  talk  me”  said mary flew into  fine passion she could fly into  passion without making  noise she just grew sour  obstinate  did not care what happened “if you send dickon away i’ll never come into this room again” she retorted “you’ll have  if i want you” said colin “i won’t” said mary “i’ll make you” said colin “they shall drag you in” “shall they mr rajah” said mary fiercely “they may drag me  but they can’t make me talk when they get me here i’ll sit  clench my teeth  never tell you one thing i won’t even look  you i’ll stare   floor” they   nice agreeable pair  they glared  each other if they had been two little street boys they would have sprung  each other  had  roughandtumble fight as  was they did  next thing  it “you   selfish thing” cried colin “what  you” said mary “selfish people always say that anyone  selfish who doesn’t do what they want you’re more selfish than i am you’re  most selfish boy i ever saw” “i’m not” snapped colin “i’m not  selfish  your fine dickon is he keeps you playing   dirt when  knows i am all  myself he’s selfish if you like” mary’s eyes flashed fire “he’s nicer than any other boy  ever lived” she said “he’s—he’s like  angel” it might sound rather silly  say  but she did not care “a nice angel” colin sneered ferociously “he’s  common cottage boy off  moor” “he’s better than  common rajah” retorted mary “he’s  thousand times better” because she   stronger   two she  beginning  get  better  him the truth    had never had  fight  anyone like himself  his life and upon  whole   rather good  him though neither  nor mary knew anything about that he turned his head  his pillow  shut his eyes   big tear  squeezed out  ran down his cheek he  beginning  feel pathetic  sorry  himself—not  anyone else “i’m not  selfish  you because i’m always ill  i’m sure there   lump coming  my back”  said “and i am going  die besides” “you’re not” contradicted mary unsympathetically he opened his eyes quite wide  indignation he had never heard such  thing said before he   once furious  slightly pleased if  person could  both  one time “i’m not”  cried “i am you know i am everybody says so” “i don’t believe it” said mary sourly “you just say   make people sorry i believe you’re proud  it i don’t believe it if you   nice boy  might  true—but you’re too nasty” in spite  his invalid back colin sat up  bed  quite  healthy rage “get out   room”  shouted   caught hold  his pillow  threw   her he  not strong enough  throw  far   only fell  her feet but mary’s face looked  pinched   nutcracker “i’m going” she said “and i won’t come back” she walked   door  when she reached  she turned round  spoke again “i  going  tell you all sorts  nice things” she said “dickon brought his fox  his rook  i  going  tell you all about them now i won’t tell you  single thing” she marched out   door  closed  behind her  there  her great astonishment she found  trained nurse standing  if she had been listening and more amazing still—she  laughing she   big handsome young woman who ought not  have been  trained nurse  all  she could not bear invalids  she  always making excuses  leave colin  martha or anyone else who would take her place mary had never liked her  she simply stood  gazed up  her  she stood giggling into her handkerchief “what  you laughing at” she asked her “at you two young ones” said  nurse “it’s  best thing  could happen   sickly pampered thing  have someone  stand up  him that’s  spoiled  himself”  she laughed into her handkerchief again “if he’d had  young vixen   sister  fight   would have been  saving  him” “is  going  die” “i don’t know  i don’t care” said  nurse “hysterics  temper  half what ails him” “what  hysterics” asked mary “you’ll find out if you work him into  tantrum after this—but  any rate you’ve given him something  have hysterics about  i’m glad  it” mary went back  her room not feeling  all  she had felt when she had come    garden she  cross  disappointed but not  all sorry  colin she had looked forward  telling him  great many things  she had meant  try  make up her mind whether  would  safe  trust him   great secret she had been beginning  think  would be but now she had changed her mind entirely she would never tell him   could stay  his room  never get any fresh air  die if  liked it would serve him right she felt so sour  unrelenting    few minutes she almost forgot about dickon   green veil creeping over  world   soft wind blowing down   moor martha  waiting  her   trouble  her face had been temporarily replaced  interest  curiosity there   wooden box   table   cover had been removed  revealed    full  neat packages “mr craven sent   you” said martha “it looks  if  had picturebooks  it” mary remembered what  had asked her  day she had gone  his room “do you want anything—dolls—toys—books” she opened  package wondering if  had sent  doll  also wondering what she should do   if  had but  had not sent one there  several beautiful books such  colin had  two  them  about gardens   full  pictures there  two or three games  there   beautiful little writingcase   gold monogram     gold pen  inkstand everything  so nice  her pleasure began  crowd her anger out  her mind she had not expected him  remember her  all  her hard little heart grew quite warm “i can write better than i can print” she said “and  first thing i shall write   pen    letter  tell him i am much obliged” if she had been friends  colin she would have run  show him her presents  once  they would have looked   pictures  read some   gardening books  perhaps tried playing  games   would have enjoyed himself so much  would never once have thought   going  die or have put his hand  his spine  see if there   lump coming he had  way  doing  which she could not bear it gave her  uncomfortable frightened feeling because  always looked so frightened himself he said  if  felt even quite  little lump some day  should know his hunch had begun  grow something  had heard mrs medlock whispering   nurse had given him  idea   had thought over   secret until   quite firmly fixed  his mind mrs medlock had said his father’s back had begun  show  crookedness   way when    child he had never told anyone but mary  most  his “tantrums”  they called them grew out  his hysterical hidden fear mary had been sorry  him when  had told her “he always began  think about  when   cross or tired” she said  herself “and   been cross today perhaps—perhaps   been thinking about  all afternoon” she stood still looking down   carpet  thinking “i said i would never go back again—” she hesitated knitting her brows—“but perhaps just perhaps i  go  see—if  wants me—in  morning perhaps he’ll try  throw his pillow  me again but—i think—i’ll go” chapter xvii a tantrum she had got up very early   morning  had worked hard   garden  she  tired  sleepy so  soon  martha had brought her supper  she had eaten it she  glad  go  bed as she laid her head   pillow she murmured  herself “i’ll go out before breakfast  work  dickon  then afterward—i believe—i’ll go  see him” she thought    middle   night when she  awakened  such dreadful sounds  she jumped out  bed   instant what  it—what  it the next minute she felt quite sure she knew doors  opened  shut  there  hurrying feet   corridors  someone  crying  screaming   same time screaming  crying   horrible way “it’s colin” she said “he’s having one  those tantrums  nurse called hysterics how awful  sounds” as she listened   sobbing screams she did not wonder  people  so frightened  they gave him his own way  everything rather than hear them she put her hands over her ears  felt sick  shivering “i don’t know what  do i don’t know what  do” she kept saying “i can’t bear it” once she wondered if  would stop if she dared go  him  then she remembered how  had driven her out   room  thought  perhaps  sight  her might make him worse even when she pressed her hands more tightly over her ears she could not keep  awful sounds out she hated them so   so terrified  them  suddenly they began  make her angry  she felt  if she should like  fly into  tantrum herself  frighten him    frightening her she  not used  anyone’s tempers but her own she took her hands  her ears  sprang up  stamped her foot “he ought   stopped somebody ought  make him stop somebody ought  beat him” she cried out just then she heard feet almost running down  corridor  her door opened   nurse came in she  not laughing now  any means she even looked rather pale “he’s worked himself into hysterics” she said   great hurry “he’ll do himself harm no one can do anything  him you come  try like  good child he likes you” “he turned me out   room this morning” said mary stamping her foot  excitement the stamp rather pleased  nurse the truth   she had been afraid she might find mary crying  hiding her head under  bedclothes “that’s right” she said “you’re   right humor you go  scold him give him something new  think of do go child  quick  ever you can” it  not until afterward  mary realized   thing had been funny  well  dreadful—that   funny  all  grownup people  so frightened  they came   little girl just because they guessed she  almost  bad  colin himself she flew along  corridor   nearer she got   screams  higher her temper mounted she felt quite wicked   time she reached  door she slapped  open  her hand  ran across  room   fourposted bed “you stop” she almost shouted “you stop i hate you everybody hates you i wish everybody would run out   house  let you scream yourself  death you will scream yourself  death   minute  i wish you would” a nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said such things but  just happened   shock  hearing them   best possible thing  this hysterical boy whom no one had ever dared  restrain or contradict he had been lying  his face beating his pillow  his hands   actually almost jumped around  turned so quickly   sound   furious little voice his face looked dreadful white  red  swollen    gasping  choking but savage little mary did not care  atom “if you scream another scream” she said “i’ll scream too—and i can scream louder than you can  i’ll frighten you i’ll frighten you” he actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so the scream which had been coming almost choked him the tears  streaming down his face   shook all over “i can’t stop”  gasped  sobbed “i can’t—i can’t” “you can” shouted mary “half  ails you  hysterics  temper—just hysterics—hysterics—hysterics”  she stamped each time she said it “i felt  lump—i felt it” choked out colin “i knew i should i shall have  hunch  my back  then i shall die”   began  writhe again  turned  his face  sobbed  wailed but  didn’t scream “you didn’t feel  lump” contradicted mary fiercely “if you did   only  hysterical lump hysterics makes lumps there’s nothing  matter  your horrid back—nothing but hysterics turn over  let me look  it” she liked  word “hysterics”  felt somehow  if  had  effect  him he  probably like herself  had never heard  before “nurse” she commanded “come here  show me his back this minute” the nurse mrs medlock  martha had been standing huddled together near  door staring  her their mouths half open all three had gasped  fright more than once the nurse came forward  if she  half afraid colin  heaving  great breathless sobs “perhaps he—he won’t let me” she hesitated   low voice colin heard her however   gasped out between two sobs “shshow her sheshe’ll see then” it   poor thin back  look  when   bared every rib could  counted  every joint   spine though mistress mary did not count them  she bent over  examined them   solemn savage little face she looked so sour  oldfashioned   nurse turned her head aside  hide  twitching  her mouth there  just  minute’s silence  even colin tried  hold his breath while mary looked up  down his spine  down  up  intently  if she had been  great doctor  london “there’s not  single lump there” she said  last “there’s not  lump  big   pin—except backbone lumps  you can only feel them because you’re thin i’ve got backbone lumps myself  they used  stick out  much  yours do until i began  get fatter  i am not fat enough yet  hide them there’s not  lump  big   pin if you ever say there  again i shall laugh” no one but colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish words had  him if  had ever had anyone  talk  about his secret terrors—if  had ever dared  let himself ask questions—if  had had childish companions  had not lain  his back   huge closed house breathing  atmosphere heavy   fears  people who  most  them ignorant  tired  him  would have found out  most  his fright  illness  created  himself but  had lain  thought  himself  his aches  weariness  hours  days  months  years and now   angry unsympathetic little girl insisted obstinately    not  ill   thought    actually felt  if she might  speaking  truth “i didn’t know” ventured  nurse “that  thought  had  lump  his spine his back  weak because  won’t try  sit up i could have told him there  no lump there” colin gulped  turned his face  little  look  her “ccould you”  said pathetically “yes sir” “there” said mary  she gulped too colin turned  his face again  but  his longdrawn broken breaths which   dying down  his storm  sobbing  lay still   minute though great tears streamed down his face  wet  pillow actually  tears meant   curious great relief had come  him presently  turned  looked   nurse again  strangely enough   not like  rajah  all   spoke  her “do you think—i could—live  grow up”  said the nurse  neither clever nor softhearted but she could repeat some   london doctor’s words “you probably  if you  do what you  told  do  not give way  your temper  stay out  great deal   fresh air” colin’s tantrum had passed    weak  worn out  crying  this perhaps made him feel gentle he put out his hand  little toward mary  i am glad  say that her own tantum having passed she  softened too  met him halfway  her hand so     sort  making up “i’ll—i’ll go out  you mary”  said “i shan’t hate fresh air if we can find—” he remembered just  time  stop himself  saying “if we can find  secret garden”   ended “i shall like  go out  you if dickon  come  push my chair i do so want  see dickon   fox   crow” the nurse remade  tumbled bed  shook  straightened  pillows then she made colin  cup  beef tea  gave  cup  mary who really  very glad  get  after her excitement mrs medlock  martha gladly slipped away  after everything  neat  calm   order  nurse looked  if she would very gladly slip away also she   healthy young woman who resented being robbed  her sleep  she yawned quite openly  she looked  mary who had pushed her big footstool close   fourposted bed   holding colin’s hand “you must go back  get your sleep out” she said “he’ll drop off after  while—if he’s not too upset then i’ll lie down myself   next room” “would you like me  sing you  song i learned  my ayah” mary whispered  colin his hand pulled hers gently   turned his tired eyes  her appealingly “oh yes”  answered “it’s such  soft song i shall go  sleep   minute” “i  put him  sleep” mary said   yawning nurse “you can go if you like” “well” said  nurse   attempt  reluctance “if  doesn’t go  sleep  half  hour you must call me” “very well” answered mary the nurse  out   room   minute   soon  she  gone colin pulled mary’s hand again “i almost told”  said “but i stopped myself  time i won’t talk  i’ll go  sleep but you said you had  whole lot  nice things  tell me have you—do you think you have found out anything  all about  way into  secret garden” mary looked  his poor little tired face  swollen eyes  her heart relented “yees” she answered “i think i have and if you  go  sleep i  tell you tomorrow” his hand quite trembled “oh mary”  said “oh mary if i could get into  i think i should live  grow up do you suppose  instead  singing  ayah song—you could just tell me softly  you did  first day what you imagine  looks like inside i am sure   make me go  sleep” “yes” answered mary “shut your eyes” he closed his eyes  lay quite still  she held his hand  began  speak very slowly    very low voice “i think   been left alone so long—that   grown all into  lovely tangle i think  roses have climbed  climbed  climbed until they hang   branches  walls  creep over  ground—almost like  strange gray mist some  them have died but many—are alive  when  summer comes there   curtains  fountains  roses i think  ground  full  daffodils  snowdrops  lilies  iris working their way out   dark now  spring  begun—perhaps—perhaps—” the soft drone  her voice  making him stiller  stiller  she saw   went on “perhaps they  coming up through  grass—perhaps there  clusters  purple crocuses  gold ones—even now perhaps  leaves  beginning  break out  uncurl—and perhaps—the gray  changing   green gauze veil  creeping—and creeping over—everything and  birds  coming  look  it—because  is—so safe  still and perhaps—perhaps—perhaps—” very softly  slowly indeed “the robin  found  mate—and  building  nest” and colin  asleep chapter xviii “tha’ munnot waste no time” of course mary did not waken early  next morning she slept late because she  tired  when martha brought her breakfast she told her  though colin  quite quiet   ill  feverish   always  after  had worn himself out   fit  crying mary ate her breakfast slowly  she listened “he says  wishes tha’ would please go  see him  soon  tha’ can” martha said “it’s queer what  fancy he’s took  thee tha’ did give  him last night  sure—didn’t tha nobody else would have dared  do it eh poor lad he’s been spoiled till salt won’t save him mother says  th’ two worst things  can happen   child  never  have his own way—or always  have it she doesn’t know which  th’ worst tha’    fine temper tha’self too but  says  me when i went into his room ‘please ask miss mary if she’ll please come an’ talk  me’ think o’ him saying please will you go miss” “i’ll run  see dickon first” said mary “no i’ll go  see colin first  tell him—i know what i’ll tell him”   sudden inspiration she had her hat  when she appeared  colin’s room    second  looked disappointed he   bed his face  pitifully white  there  dark circles round his eyes “i’m glad you came”  said “my head aches  i ache all over because i’m so tired are you going somewhere” mary went  leaned against his bed “i won’t  long” she said “i’m going  dickon but i’ll come back colin it’s—it’s something about  garden” his whole face brightened   little color came into it “oh  it”  cried out “i dreamed about  all night i heard you say something about gray changing into green  i dreamed i  standing   place all filled  trembling little green leaves—and there  birds  nests everywhere  they looked so soft  still i’ll lie  think about  until you come back” in five minutes mary   dickon  their garden the fox   crow   him again  this time  had brought two tame squirrels “i came over   pony this mornin’”  said “eh    good little chap—jump is i brought these two  my pockets this here one he’s called nut an’ this here other one’s called shell” when  said “nut” one squirrel leaped   his right shoulder  when  said “shell”  other one leaped   his left shoulder when they sat down   grass  captain curled  their feet soot solemnly listening   tree  nut  shell nosing about close  them  seemed  mary   would  scarcely bearable  leave such delightfulness but when she began  tell her story somehow  look  dickon’s funny face gradually changed her mind she could see  felt sorrier  colin than she did he looked up   sky  all about him “just listen  them birds—th’ world seems full  ’em—all whistlin’ an’ pipin’”  said “look  ’em dartin’ about an’ hearken  ’em callin’  each other come springtime seems like  if all th’ world’s callin’ the leaves  uncurlin’ so you can see ’em—an’ my word th’ nice smells there  about” sniffing  his happy turnedup nose “an’  poor lad lyin’ shut up an’ seein’ so little   gets  thinkin’ o’ things  sets him screamin’ eh my we mun get him out here—we mun get him watchin’  listenin’ an’ sniffin’ up th’ air an’ get him just soaked through wi’ sunshine an’ we munnot lose no time about it” when   very much interested  often spoke quite broad yorkshire though  other times  tried  modify his dialect so  mary could better understand but she loved his broad yorkshire  had  fact been trying  learn  speak  herself so she spoke  little now “aye  we mun” she said which meant “yes indeed we must” “i’ll tell thee what us’ll do first” she proceeded  dickon grinned because when  little wench tried  twist her tongue into speaking yorkshire  amused him very much “he’s took  graidely fancy  thee he wants  see thee   wants  see soot an’ captain when i go back   house  talk  him i’ll ax him if tha’ canna’ come an’ see him tomorrow mornin’—an’ bring tha’ creatures wi’ thee—an’ then—in  bit when there’s more leaves out an’ happen  bud or two we’ll get him  come out an’ tha’ shall push him  his chair an’ we’ll bring him here an’ show him everything” when she stopped she  quite proud  herself she had never made  long speech  yorkshire before  she had remembered very well “tha’ mun talk  bit o’ yorkshire like   mester colin” dickon chuckled “tha’ll make him laugh an’ there’s nowt  good  ill folk  laughin’ is mother says she believes  half  hour’s good laugh every mornin’ ’ud cure  chap   makin’ ready  typhus fever” “i’m going  talk yorkshire  him this very day” said mary chuckling herself the garden had reached  time when every day  every night  seemed  if magicians  passing through  drawing loveliness out   earth   boughs  wands it  hard  go away  leave  all particularly  nut had actually crept   her dress  shell had scrambled down  trunk   appletree they sat under  stayed there looking  her  inquiring eyes but she went back   house  when she sat down close  colin’s bed  began  sniff  dickon did though not  such  experienced way “you smell like flowers and—and fresh things”  cried out quite joyously “what   you smell of it’s cool  warm  sweet all   same time” “it’s th’ wind  th’ moor” said mary “it comes o’ sittin’  th’ grass under  tree wi’ dickon an’ wi’ captain an’ soot an’ nut an’ shell it’s th’ springtime an’ out o’ doors an’ sunshine  smells so graidely” she said   broadly  she could  you do not know how broadly yorkshire sounds until you have heard someone speak it colin began  laugh “what  you doing”  said “i never heard you talk like  before how funny  sounds” “i’m givin’ thee  bit o’ yorkshire” answered mary triumphantly “i canna’ talk  graidely  dickon an’ martha can but tha’ sees i can shape  bit doesn’t tha’ understand  bit o’ yorkshire when tha’ hears it an’ tha’  yorkshire lad thysel’ bred an’ born eh i wonder tha’rt not ashamed o’ thy face” and then she began  laugh too  they both laughed until they could not stop themselves  they laughed until  room echoed  mrs medlock opening  door  come  drew back into  corridor  stood listening amazed “well upon my word” she said speaking rather broad yorkshire herself because there  no one  hear her  she  so astonished “whoever heard th’ like whoever  earth would ha’ thought it” there  so much  talk about it seemed  if colin could never hear enough  dickon  captain  soot  nut  shell   pony whose name  jump mary had run round into  wood  dickon  see jump he   tiny little shaggy moor pony  thick locks hanging over his eyes    pretty face   nuzzling velvet nose he  rather thin  living  moor grass but    tough  wiry  if  muscle  his little legs had been made  steel springs he had lifted his head  whinnied softly  moment  saw dickon   had trotted up  him  put his head across his shoulder  then dickon had talked into his ear  jump had talked back  odd little whinnies  puffs  snorts dickon had made him give mary his small front hoof  kiss her  her cheek  his velvet muzzle “does  really understand everything dickon says” colin asked “it seems  if  does” answered mary “dickon says anything  understand if you’re friends    sure but you have   friends  sure” colin lay quiet  little while  his strange gray eyes seemed   staring   wall but mary saw   thinking “i wish i  friends  things”  said  last “but i’m not i never had anything   friends with  i can’t bear people” “can’t you bear me” asked mary “yes i can”  answered “it’s funny but i even like you” “ben weatherstaff said i  like him” said mary “he said he’d warrant we’d both got  same nasty tempers i think you  like him too we  all three alike—you  i  ben weatherstaff he said we  neither  us much  look   we   sour  we looked but i don’t feel  sour  i used  before i knew  robin  dickon” “did you feel  if you hated people” “yes” answered mary without any affectation “i should have detested you if i had seen you before i saw  robin  dickon” colin put out his thin hand  touched her “mary”  said “i wish i hadn’t said what i did about sending dickon away i hated you when you said   like  angel  i laughed  you but—but perhaps  is” “well   rather funny  say it” she admitted frankly “because his nose does turn up     big mouth  his clothes have patches all over them   talks broad yorkshire but—but if  angel did come  yorkshire  live   moor—if there   yorkshire angel—i believe he’d understand  green things  know how  make them grow   would know how  talk   wild creatures  dickon does  they’d know   friends  sure” “i shouldn’t mind dickon looking  me” said colin “i want  see him” “i’m glad you said that” answered mary “because—because—” quite suddenly  came into her mind  this   minute  tell him colin knew something new  coming “because what”  cried eagerly mary  so anxious  she got up  her stool  came  him  caught hold  both his hands “can i trust you i trusted dickon because birds trusted him can i trust you—for sure—for sure” she implored her face  so solemn   almost whispered his answer “yes—yes” “well dickon  come  see you tomorrow morning  he’ll bring his creatures  him” “oh oh” colin cried out  delight “but that’s not all” mary went on almost pale  solemn excitement “the rest  better there   door into  garden i found it it  under  ivy   wall” if  had been  strong healthy boy colin would probably have shouted “hooray hooray hooray” but   weak  rather hysterical his eyes grew bigger  bigger   gasped  breath “oh mary”  cried out   half sob “shall i see it shall i get into it shall i live  get into it”   clutched her hands  dragged her toward him “of course you’ll see it” snapped mary indignantly “of course you’ll live  get into it don’t  silly” and she  so unhysterical  natural  childish  she brought him  his senses   began  laugh  himself   few minutes afterward she  sitting  her stool again telling him not what she imagined  secret garden   like but what  really was  colin’s aches  tiredness  forgotten    listening enraptured “it  just what you thought  would be”  said  last “it sounds just  if you had really seen it you know i said  when you told me first” mary hesitated about two minutes  then boldly spoke  truth “i had seen it—and i had been in” she said “i found  key  got  weeks ago but i daren’t tell you—i daren’t because i  so afraid i couldn’t trust you—for sure” chapter xix “it has come” of course dr craven had been sent   morning after colin had had his tantrum he  always sent   once when such  thing occurred   always found when  arrived  white shaken boy lying  his bed sulky  still so hysterical    ready  break into fresh sobbing   least word in fact dr craven dreaded  detested  difficulties  these visits on this occasion   away  misselthwaite manor until afternoon “how  he”  asked mrs medlock rather irritably when  arrived “he  break  bloodvessel  one  those fits some day the boy  half insane  hysteria  selfindulgence” “well sir” answered mrs medlock “you’ll scarcely believe your eyes when you see him that plain sourfaced child that’s almost  bad  himself  just bewitched him how she’s done  there’s no telling the lord knows she’s nothing  look   you scarcely ever hear her speak but she did what none  us dare do she just flew  him like  little cat last night  stamped her feet  ordered him  stop screaming  somehow she startled him so   actually did stop  this afternoon—well just come up  see sir it’s past crediting” the scene which dr craven beheld when  entered his patient’s room  indeed rather astonishing  him as mrs medlock opened  door  heard laughing  chattering colin   his sofa  his dressinggown    sitting up quite straight looking   picture  one   garden books  talking   plain child who   moment could scarcely  called plain  all because her face  so glowing  enjoyment “those long spires  blue ones—we’ll have  lot  those” colin  announcing “they’re called delphiniums” “dickon says they’re larkspurs made big  grand” cried mistress mary “there  clumps there already” then they saw dr craven  stopped mary became quite still  colin looked fretful “i am sorry  hear you  ill last night my boy” dr craven said  trifle nervously he  rather  nervous man “i’m better now—much better” colin answered rather like  rajah “i’m going out  my chair   day or two if   fine i want some fresh air” dr craven sat down  him  felt his pulse  looked  him curiously “it must   very fine day”  said “and you must  very careful not  tire yourself” “fresh air won’t tire me” said  young rajah as there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shrieked aloud  rage  had insisted  fresh air would give him cold  kill him   not   wondered   his doctor felt somewhat startled “i thought you did not like fresh air”  said “i don’t when i am  myself” replied  rajah “but my cousin  going out  me” “and  nurse  course” suggested dr craven “no i  not have  nurse” so magnificently  mary could not help remembering how  young native prince had looked  his diamonds  emeralds  pearls stuck all over him   great rubies   small dark hand  had waved  command his servants  approach  salaams  receive his orders “my cousin knows how  take care  me i am always better when she   me she made me better last night a very strong boy i know  push my carriage” dr craven felt rather alarmed if this tiresome hysterical boy should chance  get well  himself would lose all chance  inheriting misselthwaite but   not  unscrupulous man though    weak one   did not intend  let him run into actual danger “he must   strong boy   steady boy”  said “and i must know something about him who  he what  his name” “it’s dickon” mary spoke up suddenly she felt somehow  everybody who knew  moor must know dickon and she  right too she saw    moment dr craven’s serious face relaxed into  relieved smile “oh dickon”  said “if   dickon you   safe enough he’s  strong   moor pony  dickon” “and he’s trusty” said mary “he’s th’ trustiest lad i’ yorkshire” she had been talking yorkshire  colin  she forgot herself “did dickon teach you that” asked dr craven laughing outright “i’m learning   if   french” said mary rather coldly “it’s like  native dialect  india very clever people try  learn them i like   so does colin” “well well”  said “if  amuses you perhaps  won’t do you any harm did you take your bromide last night colin” “no” colin answered “i wouldn’t take   first  after mary made me quiet she talked me  sleep—in  low voice—about  spring creeping into  garden” “that sounds soothing” said dr craven more perplexed than ever  glancing sideways  mistress mary sitting  her stool  looking down silently   carpet “you  evidently better but you must remember—” “i don’t want  remember” interrupted  rajah appearing again “when i lie  myself  remember i begin  have pains everywhere  i think  things  make me begin  scream because i hate them so if there   doctor anywhere who could make you forget you  ill instead  remembering  i would have him brought here” and  waved  thin hand which ought really  have been covered  royal signet rings made  rubies “it  because my cousin makes me forget  she makes me better” dr craven had never made such  short stay after  “tantrum” usually   obliged  remain  very long time  do  great many things this afternoon  did not give any medicine or leave any new orders    spared any disagreeable scenes when  went downstairs  looked very thoughtful  when  talked  mrs medlock   library she felt     much puzzled man “well sir” she ventured “could you have believed it” “it  certainly  new state  affairs” said  doctor “and there’s no denying   better than  old one” “i believe susan sowerby’s right—i do that” said mrs medlock “i stopped  her cottage  my way  thwaite yesterday  had  bit  talk  her and she says  me ‘well sarah ann she mayn’t   good child an’ she mayn’t   pretty one but she’s  child an’ children needs children’ we went  school together susan sowerby  me” “she’s  best sick nurse i know” said dr craven “when i find her   cottage i know  chances   i shall save my patient” mrs medlock smiled she  fond  susan sowerby “she’s got  way  her  susan” she went  quite volubly “i’ve been thinking all morning  one thing she said yesterday she says ‘once when i  givin’ th’ children  bit   preach after they’d been fightin’ i ses  ’em all “when i   school my jography told  th’ world  shaped like  orange an’ i found out before i  ten  th’ whole orange doesn’t belong  nobody no one owns more than his bit   quarter an’ there’s times  seems like there’s not enow quarters  go round but don’t you—none o’ you—think  you own th’ whole orange or you’ll find out you’re mistaken an’ you won’t find  out without hard knocks” ‘what children learns  children’ she says ‘is  there’s no sense  grabbin’  th’ whole orange—peel an’ all if you do you’ll likely not get even th’ pips an’ them’s too bitter  eat’” “she’s  shrewd woman” said dr craven putting  his coat “well she’s got  way  saying things” ended mrs medlock much pleased “sometimes i’ve said  her ‘eh susan if you   different woman an’ didn’t talk such broad yorkshire i’ve seen  times when i should have said you  clever’” that night colin slept without once awakening  when  opened his eyes   morning  lay still  smiled without knowing it—smiled because  felt so curiously comfortable it  actually nice   awake   turned over  stretched his limbs luxuriously he felt  if tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves  let him go he did not know  dr craven would have said  his nerves had relaxed  rested themselves instead  lying  staring   wall  wishing  had not awakened his mind  full   plans   mary had made yesterday  pictures   garden   dickon  his wild creatures it  so nice  have things  think about and  had not been awake more than ten minutes when  heard feet running along  corridor  mary    door the next minute she    room  had run across  his bed bringing  her  waft  fresh air full   scent   morning “you’ve been out you’ve been out there’s  nice smell  leaves”  cried she had been running  her hair  loose  blown  she  bright   air  pinkcheeked though  could not see it “it’s so beautiful” she said  little breathless  her speed “you never saw anything so beautiful it  come i thought  had come  other morning but   only coming it  here now it  come  spring dickon says so” “has it” cried colin  though  really knew nothing about   felt his heart beat he actually sat up  bed “open  window”  added laughing half  joyful excitement  half  his own fancy “perhaps we may hear golden trumpets” and though  laughed mary    window   moment    moment more   opened wide  freshness  softness  scents  birds’ songs  pouring through “that’s fresh air” she said “lie  your back  draw  long breaths  it that’s what dickon does when he’s lying   moor he says  feels   his veins   makes him strong   feels  if  could live forever  ever breathe   breathe it” she  only repeating what dickon had told her but she caught colin’s fancy “’forever  ever’ does  make him feel like that”  said   did  she told him drawing  long deep breaths over  over again until  felt  something quite new  delightful  happening  him mary   his bedside again “things  crowding up out   earth” she ran    hurry “and there  flowers uncurling  buds  everything   green veil  covered nearly all  gray   birds   such  hurry about their nests  fear they may  too late  some  them  even fighting  places   secret garden and  rosebushes look  wick  wick can be  there  primroses   lanes  woods   seeds we planted  up  dickon  brought  fox   crow   squirrels   newborn lamb” and then she paused  breath the newborn lamb dickon had found three days before lying   dead mother among  gorse bushes   moor it  not  first motherless lamb  had found   knew what  do  it he had taken    cottage wrapped  his jacket   had let  lie near  fire  had fed   warm milk it   soft thing   darling silly baby face  legs rather long   body dickon had carried  over  moor  his arms   feeding bottle   his pocket   squirrel  when mary had sat under  tree   limp warmness huddled  her lap she had felt  if she  too full  strange joy  speak a lamb—a lamb a living lamb who lay  your lap like  baby she  describing   great joy  colin  listening  drawing  long breaths  air when  nurse entered she started  little   sight   open window she had sat stifling   room many  warm day because her patient  sure  open windows gave people cold “are you sure you  not chilly master colin” she inquired “no”   answer “i am breathing long breaths  fresh air it makes you strong i am going  get up   sofa  breakfast my cousin  have breakfast  me” the nurse went away concealing  smile  give  order  two breakfasts she found  servants’ hall  more amusing place than  invalid’s chamber  just now everybody wanted  hear  news  upstairs there   great deal  joking about  unpopular young recluse who   cook said “had found his master  good  him” the servants’ hall had been very tired   tantrums   butler who   man   family had more than once expressed his opinion   invalid would  all  better “for  good hiding” when colin   his sofa   breakfast  two  put upon  table  made  announcement   nurse  his most rajahlike manner “a boy   fox   crow  two squirrels   newborn lamb  coming  see me this morning i want them brought upstairs  soon  they come”  said “you  not  begin playing   animals   servants’ hall  keep them there i want them here” the nurse gave  slight gasp  tried  conceal    cough “yes sir” she answered “i’ll tell you what you can do” added colin waving his hand “you can tell martha  bring them here the boy  martha’s brother his name  dickon     animal charmer” “i hope  animals won’t bite master colin” said  nurse “i told you    charmer” said colin austerely “charmers’ animals never bite” “there  snakecharmers  india” said mary “and they can put their snakes’ heads  their mouths” “goodness” shuddered  nurse they ate their breakfast   morning air pouring  upon them colin’s breakfast   very good one  mary watched him  serious interest “you  begin  get fatter just  i did” she said “i never wanted my breakfast when i   india  now i always want it” “i wanted mine this morning” said colin “perhaps    fresh air when do you think dickon  come” he  not long  coming in about ten minutes mary held up her hand “listen” she said “did you hear  caw” colin listened  heard it  oddest sound   world  hear inside  house  hoarse “cawcaw” “yes”  answered “that’s soot” said mary “listen again do you hear  bleat—a tiny one” “oh yes” cried colin quite flushing “that’s  newborn lamb” said mary “he’s coming” dickon’s moorland boots  thick  clumsy  though  tried  walk quietly they made  clumping sound   walked through  long corridors mary  colin heard him marching—marching until  passed through  tapestry door    soft carpet  colin’s own passage “if you please sir” announced martha opening  door “if you please sir here’s dickon an’ his creatures” dickon came  smiling his nicest wide smile the newborn lamb   his arms   little red fox trotted  his side nut sat  his left shoulder  soot  his right  shell’s head  paws peeped out  his coat pocket colin slowly sat up  stared  stared—as  had stared when  first saw mary but this   stare  wonder  delight the truth    spite  all  had heard  had not   least understood what this boy would  like   his fox  his crow  his squirrels  his lamb  so near  him  his friendliness  they seemed almost   part  himself colin had never talked   boy  his life    so overwhelmed  his own pleasure  curiosity   did not even think  speaking but dickon did not feel  least shy or awkward he had not felt embarrassed because  crow had not known his language  had only stared  had not spoken  him  first time they met creatures  always like  until they found out about you he walked over  colin’s sofa  put  newborn lamb quietly  his lap  immediately  little creature turned   warm velvet dressinggown  began  nuzzle  nuzzle into  folds  butt  tightcurled head  soft impatience against his side of course no boy could have helped speaking then “what   doing” cried colin “what does  want” “it wants  mother” said dickon smiling more  more “i brought   thee  bit hungry because i knowed tha’d like  see  feed” he knelt down   sofa  took  feedingbottle  his pocket “come on little ’un”  said turning  small woolly white head   gentle brown hand “this  what tha’s after tha’ll get more out o’ this than tha’  out o’ silk velvet coats there now”   pushed  rubber tip   bottle into  nuzzling mouth   lamb began  suck   ravenous ecstasy after  there  no wondering what  say by  time  lamb fell asleep questions poured forth  dickon answered them all he told them how  had found  lamb just   sun  rising three mornings ago he had been standing   moor listening   skylark  watching him swing higher  higher into  sky until   only  speck   heights  blue “i’d almost lost him but  his song an’ i  wonderin’ how  chap could hear  when  seemed  if he’d get out o’ th’ world   minute—an’ just then i heard somethin’ else far off among th’ gorse bushes it   weak bleatin’ an’ i knowed    new lamb   hungry an’ i knowed  wouldn’t  hungry if  hadn’t lost  mother somehow so i set off searchin’ eh i did have  look  it i went  an’ out among th’ gorse bushes an’ round an’ round an’ i always seemed  take th’ wrong turnin’ but  last i seed  bit o’ white   rock  top o’ th’ moor an’ i climbed up an’ found th’ little ’un half dead wi’ cold an’ clemmin’” while  talked soot flew solemnly   out   open window  cawed remarks about  scenery while nut  shell made excursions into  big trees outside  ran up  down trunks  explored branches captain curled up near dickon who sat   hearthrug  preference they looked   pictures   gardening books  dickon knew all  flowers  their country names  knew exactly which ones  already growing   secret garden “i couldna’ say  there name”  said pointing  one under which  written “aquilegia” “but us calls   columbine an’  there one it’s  snapdragon  they both grow wild  hedges but these  garden ones an’ they’re bigger an’ grander there’s some big clumps o’ columbine  th’ garden they’ll look like  bed o’ blue an’ white butterflies flutterin’ when they’re out” “i’m going  see them” cried colin “i am going  see them” “aye  tha’ mun” said mary quite seriously “an’ tha’ munnot lose no time about it” chapter xx “i shall live forever—and ever—and ever” but they  obliged  wait more than  week because first there came some very windy days  then colin  threatened   cold which two things happening one after  other would no doubt have thrown him into  rage but  there  so much careful  mysterious planning  do  almost every day dickon came in if only   few minutes  talk about what  happening   moor    lanes  hedges    borders  streams the things  had  tell about otters’  badgers’  waterrats’ houses not  mention birds’ nests  fieldmice  their burrows  enough  make you almost tremble  excitement when you heard all  intimate details   animal charmer  realized  what thrilling eagerness  anxiety  whole busy underworld  working “they’re same  us” said dickon “only they have  build their homes every year an’  keeps ’em so busy they fair scuffle  get ’em done” the most absorbing thing however   preparations   made before colin could  transported  sufficient secrecy   garden no one must see  chaircarriage  dickon  mary after they turned  certain corner   shrubbery  entered upon  walk outside  ivied walls as each day passed colin had become more  more fixed  his feeling   mystery surrounding  garden  one   greatest charms nothing must spoil that no one must ever suspect  they had  secret people must think    simply going out  mary  dickon because  liked them  did not object  their looking  him they had long  quite delightful talks about their route they would go up this path  down  one  cross  other  go round among  fountain flowerbeds  if they  looking   “beddingout plants”  head gardener mr roach had been having arranged that would seem such  rational thing  do  no one would think   all mysterious they would turn into  shrubbery walks  lose themselves until they came   long walls it  almost  serious  elaborately thought out   plans  march made  great generals  time  war rumors   new  curious things which  occurring   invalid’s apartments had  course filtered through  servants’ hall into  stable yards  out among  gardeners but notwithstanding this mr roach  startled one day when  received orders  master colin’s room   effect   must report himself   apartment no outsider had ever seen   invalid himself desired  speak  him “well well”  said  himself   hurriedly changed his coat “what’s  do now his royal highness  wasn’t   looked  calling up  man he’s never set eyes on” mr roach  not without curiosity he had never caught even  glimpse   boy  had heard  dozen exaggerated stories about his uncanny looks  ways  his insane tempers the thing  had heard oftenest    might die  any moment  there had been numerous fanciful descriptions   humped back  helpless limbs given  people who had never seen him “things  changing  this house mr roach” said mrs medlock  she led him up  back staircase   corridor   which opened  hitherto mysterious chamber “let’s hope they’re changing   better mrs medlock”  answered “they couldn’t well change   worse” she continued “and queer   all  there’s them  finds their duties made  lot easier  stand up under don’t you  surprised mr roach if you find yourself   middle   menagerie  martha sowerby’s dickon more  home than you or me could ever be” there really   sort  magic about dickon  mary always privately believed when mr roach heard his name  smiled quite leniently “he’d   home  buckingham palace or   bottom   coal mine”  said “and yet it’s not impudence either he’s just fine   lad” it  perhaps well  had been prepared or  might have been startled when  bedroom door  opened  large crow which seemed quite  home perched   high back   carven chair announced  entrance   visitor  saying “caw—caw” quite loudly in spite  mrs medlock’s warning mr roach only just escaped being sufficiently undignified  jump backward the young rajah  neither  bed nor  his sofa he  sitting   armchair   young lamb  standing  him shaking  tail  feedinglamb fashion  dickon knelt giving  milk   bottle a squirrel  perched  dickon’s bent back attentively nibbling  nut the little girl  india  sitting   big footstool looking on “here  mr roach master colin” said mrs medlock the young rajah turned  looked his servitor over—at least   what  head gardener felt happened “oh you  roach  you”  said “i sent  you  give you some very important orders” “very good sir” answered roach wondering if    receive instructions  fell all  oaks   park or  transform  orchards into watergardens “i am going out  my chair this afternoon” said colin “if  fresh air agrees  me i may go out every day when i go none   gardeners    anywhere near  long walk   garden walls no one    there i shall go out about two o’clock  everyone must keep away until i send word  they may go back  their work” “very good sir” replied mr roach much relieved  hear   oaks might remain    orchards  safe “mary” said colin turning  her “what   thing you say  india when you have finished talking  want people  go” “you say ‘you have my permission  go’” answered mary the rajah waved his hand “you have my permission  go roach”  said “but remember this  very important” “caw—caw” remarked  crow hoarsely but not impolitely “very good sir thank you sir” said mr roach  mrs medlock took him out   room outside   corridor being  rather goodnatured man  smiled until  almost laughed “my word”  said “he’s got  fine lordly way  him hasn’t he you’d think    whole royal family rolled into one—prince consort  all” “eh” protested mrs medlock “we’ve had  let him trample all over everyone  us ever since  had feet   thinks that’s what folks  born for” “perhaps he’ll grow out  it if  lives” suggested mr roach “well there’s one thing pretty sure” said mrs medlock “if  does live   indian child stays here i’ll warrant she teaches him   whole orange does not belong  him  susan sowerby says and he’ll  likely  find out  size  his own quarter” inside  room colin  leaning back  his cushions “it’s all safe now”  said “and this afternoon i shall see it—this afternoon i shall   it” dickon went back   garden  his creatures  mary stayed  colin she did not think  looked tired but   very quiet before their lunch came    quiet while they  eating it she wondered why  asked him about it “what big eyes you’ve got colin” she said “when you  thinking they get  big  saucers what  you thinking about now” “i can’t help thinking about what   look like”  answered “the garden” asked mary “the springtime”  said “i  thinking  i’ve really never seen  before i scarcely ever went out  when i did go i never looked  it i didn’t even think about it” “i never saw   india because there wasn’t any” said mary shut   morbid  his life had been colin had more imagination than she had   least  had spent  good deal  time looking  wonderful books  pictures “that morning when you ran   said ‘it’s come it’s come’ you made me feel quite queer it sounded  if things  coming   great procession  big bursts  wafts  music i’ve  picture like   one  my books—crowds  lovely people  children  garlands  branches  blossoms  them everyone laughing  dancing  crowding  playing  pipes that  why i said ‘perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets’  told you  throw open  window” “how funny” said mary “that’s really just what  feels like and if all  flowers  leaves  green things  birds  wild creatures danced past  once what  crowd  would be i’m sure they’d dance  sing  flute   would   wafts  music” they both laughed but   not because  idea  laughable but because they both so liked it a little later  nurse made colin ready she noticed  instead  lying like  log while his clothes  put   sat up  made some efforts  help himself   talked  laughed  mary all  time “this  one  his good days sir” she said  dr craven who dropped   inspect him “he’s  such good spirits   makes him stronger” “i’ll call  again later   afternoon after   come in” said dr craven “i must see how  going out agrees  him i wish”   very low voice “that  would let you go  him” “i’d rather give up  case this moment sir than even stay here while it’s suggested” answered  nurse with sudden firmness “i hadn’t really decided  suggest it” said  doctor  his slight nervousness “we’ll try  experiment dickon’s  lad i’d trust   newborn child” the strongest footman   house carried colin downstairs  put him  his wheeled chair near which dickon waited outside after  manservant had arranged his rugs  cushions  rajah waved his hand  him    nurse “you have my permission  go”  said  they both disappeared quickly   must  confessed giggled when they  safely inside  house dickon began  push  wheeled chair slowly  steadily mistress mary walked beside   colin leaned back  lifted his face   sky the arch   looked very high   small snowy clouds seemed like white birds floating  outspread wings below  crystal blueness the wind swept  soft big breaths down   moor   strange   wild clear scented sweetness colin kept lifting his thin chest  draw  in  his big eyes looked  if   they which  listening—listening instead  his ears “there  so many sounds  singing  humming  calling out”  said “what   scent  puffs  wind bring” “it’s gorse  th’ moor that’s openin’ out” answered dickon “eh th’ bees    wonderful today” not  human creature    caught sight    paths they took in fact every gardener or gardener’s lad had been witched away but they wound   out among  shrubbery  out  round  fountain beds following their carefully planned route   mere mysterious pleasure  it but when  last they turned into  long walk   ivied walls  excited sense   approaching thrill made them  some curious reason they could not have explained begin  speak  whispers “this  it” breathed mary “this  where i used  walk up  down  wonder  wonder” “is it” cried colin  his eyes began  search  ivy  eager curiousness “but i can see nothing”  whispered “there  no door” “that’s what i thought” said mary then there   lovely breathless silence   chair wheeled on “that   garden where ben weatherstaff works” said mary “is it” said colin a few yards more  mary whispered again “this  where  robin flew over  wall” she said “is it” cried colin “oh i wish he’d come again” “and that” said mary  solemn delight pointing under  big lilac bush “is where  perched   little heap  earth  showed me  key” then colin sat up “where where there”  cried  his eyes   big   wolf’s  red ridinghood when red ridinghood felt called upon  remark  them dickon stood still   wheeled chair stopped “and this” said mary stepping    bed close   ivy “is where i went  talk  him when  chirped  me   top   wall and this   ivy  wind blew back”  she took hold   hanging green curtain “oh  it—is it” gasped colin “and here   handle  here   door dickon push him in—push him  quickly” and dickon did   one strong steady splendid push but colin had actually dropped back against his cushions even though  gasped  delight   had covered his eyes  his hands  held them there shutting out everything until they  inside   chair stopped  if  magic   door  closed not till then did  take them away  look round  round  round  dickon  mary had done and over walls  earth  trees  swinging sprays  tendrils  fair green veil  tender little leaves had crept    grass under  trees   gray urns   alcoves  here  there everywhere  touches or splashes  gold  purple  white   trees  showing pink  snow above his head  there  fluttering  wings  faint sweet pipes  humming  scents  scents and  sun fell warm upon his face like  hand   lovely touch and  wonder mary  dickon stood  stared  him he looked so strange  different because  pink glow  color had actually crept all over him—ivory face  neck  hands  all “i shall get well i shall get well”  cried out “mary dickon i shall get well and i shall live forever  ever  ever” chapter xxi ben

strange unchanging majesty   rising   sun—which  been happening every morning  thousands  thousands  thousands  years one knows  then   moment or so and one knows  sometimes when one stands  oneself

 dark blue  night  millions  stars waiting  watching makes one sure  sometimes  sound  faroff music makes  true  sometimes  look  someone’s eyes and   like   colin when  first saw  heard  felt  springtime inside  four high walls   hidden garden that afternoon  whole world seemed  devote itself  being perfect  radiantly beautiful  kind  one boy perhaps out  pure heavenly goodness  spring came  crowded everything  possibly could into  one place more than once dickon paused  what   doing  stood still   sort  growing wonder  his eyes shaking his head softly “eh   graidely”  said “i’m twelve goin’  thirteen an’ there’s  lot o’ afternoons  thirteen years but seems  me like i never seed one  graidely  this ’ere” “aye    graidely one” said mary  she sighed  mere joy “i’ll warrant it’s  graidelest one  ever   this world” “does tha’ think” said colin  dreamy carefulness “as happen   made loike this ’ere all o’ purpose  me” “my word” cried mary admiringly “that there   bit o’ good yorkshire tha’rt shapin’ firstrate—that tha’ art” and delight reigned they drew  chair under  plumtree which  snowwhite  blossoms  musical  bees it  like  king’s canopy  fairy king’s there  flowering cherrytrees near  appletrees whose buds  pink  white  here  there one had burst open wide between  blossoming branches   canopy bits  blue sky looked down like wonderful eyes mary  dickon worked  little here  there  colin watched them they brought him things  look at—buds which  opening buds which  tight closed bits  twig whose leaves  just showing green  feather   woodpecker which had dropped   grass  empty shell  some bird early hatched dickon pushed  chair slowly round  round  garden stopping every other moment  let him look  wonders springing out   earth or trailing down  trees it  like being taken  state round  country   magic king  queen  shown all  mysterious riches  contained “i wonder if we shall see  robin” said colin “tha’ll see him often enow after  bit” answered dickon “when th’ eggs hatches out th’ little chap he’ll  kep’ so busy it’ll make his head swim tha’ll see him flyin’ backward an’ for’ard carryin’ worms nigh  big  himsel’ an’  much noise goin’   th’ nest when  gets there  fair flusters him so   scarce knows which big mouth  drop th’ first piece in an’ gapin’ beaks an’ squawks  every side mother says  when she sees th’ work  robin   keep them gapin’ beaks filled she feels like she   lady  nothin’  do she says she’s seen th’ little chaps when  seemed like th’ sweat must  droppin’ off ’em though folk can’t see it” this made them giggle so delightedly  they  obliged  cover their mouths  their hands remembering  they must not  heard colin had been instructed    law  whispers  low voices several days before he liked  mysteriousness    did his best but   midst  excited enjoyment   rather difficult never  laugh above  whisper every moment   afternoon  full  new things  every hour  sunshine grew more golden the wheeled chair had been drawn back under  canopy  dickon had sat down   grass  had just drawn out his pipe when colin saw something  had not had time  notice before “that’s  very old tree over there isn’t it”  said dickon looked across  grass   tree  mary looked  there   brief moment  stillness “yes” answered dickon after it  his low voice had  very gentle sound mary gazed   tree  thought “the branches  quite gray  there’s not  single leaf anywhere” colin went on “it’s quite dead isn’t it” “aye” admitted dickon “but them roses   climbed all over   near hide every bit o’ th’ dead wood when they’re full o’ leaves an’ flowers it won’t look dead then it’ll  th’ prettiest  all” mary still gazed   tree  thought “it looks  if  big branch had been broken off” said colin “i wonder how   done” “it’s been done many  year” answered dickon “eh”   sudden relieved start  laying his hand  colin “look   robin there  is he’s been foragin’  his mate” colin  almost too late but  just caught sight  him  flash  redbreasted bird  something  his beak he darted through  greenness  into  closegrown corner   out  sight colin leaned back  his cushion again laughing  little “he’s taking her tea  her perhaps it’s five o’clock i think i’d like some tea myself” and so they  safe “it  magic which sent  robin” said mary secretly  dickon afterward “i know   magic” for both she  dickon had been afraid colin might ask something about  tree whose branch had broken off ten years ago  they had talked  over together  dickon had stood  rubbed his head   troubled way “we mun look  if  wasn’t no different  th’ other trees”  had said “we couldn’t never tell him how  broke poor lad if  says anything about  we mun—we mun try  look cheerful” “aye  we mun” had answered mary but she had not felt  if she looked cheerful when she gazed   tree she wondered  wondered  those few moments if there  any reality   other thing dickon had said he had gone  rubbing his rustred hair   puzzled way but  nice comforted look had begun  grow  his blue eyes “mrs craven   very lovely young lady”  had gone  rather hesitatingly “an’ mother she thinks maybe she’s about misselthwaite many  time lookin’ after mester colin same  all mothers do when they’re took out o’ th’ world they have  come back tha’ sees happen she’s been   garden an’ happen   her set us  work an’ told us  bring him here” mary had thought  meant something about magic she   great believer  magic secretly she quite believed  dickon worked magic  course good magic  everything near him    why people liked him so much  wild creatures knew   their friend she wondered indeed if   not possible  his gift had brought  robin just   right moment when colin asked  dangerous question she felt  his magic  working all  afternoon  making colin look like  entirely different boy it did not seem possible   could   crazy creature who had screamed  beaten  bitten his pillow even his ivory whiteness seemed  change the faint glow  color which had shown  his face  neck  hands when  first got inside  garden really never quite died away he looked  if   made  flesh instead  ivory or wax they saw  robin carry food  his mate two or three times    so suggestive  afternoon tea  colin felt they must have some “go  make one   men servants bring some   basket   rhododendron walk”  said “and then you  dickon can bring  here” it   agreeable idea easily carried out  when  white cloth  spread upon  grass  hot tea  buttered toast  crumpets  delightfully hungry meal  eaten  several birds  domestic errands paused  inquire what  going    led into investigating crumbs  great activity nut  shell whisked up trees  pieces  cake  soot took  entire half   buttered crumpet into  corner  pecked   examined  turned  over  made hoarse remarks about  until  decided  swallow  all joyfully  one gulp the afternoon  dragging towards  mellow hour the sun  deepening  gold   lances  bees  going home   birds  flying past less often dickon  mary  sitting   grass  teabasket  repacked ready   taken back   house  colin  lying against his cushions  his heavy locks pushed back  his forehead  his face looking quite  natural color “i don’t want this afternoon  go”  said “but i shall come back tomorrow   day after   day after   day after” “you’ll get plenty  fresh air won’t you” said mary “i’m going  get nothing else”  answered “i’ve seen  spring now  i’m going  see  summer i’m going  see everything grow here i’m going  grow here myself” “that tha’ will” said dickon “us’ll have thee walkin’ about here an’ diggin’ same  other folk afore long” colin flushed tremendously “walk”  said “dig shall i” dickon’s glance  him  delicately cautious neither  nor mary had ever asked if anything   matter  his legs “for sure tha’ will”  said stoutly “tha—tha’s got legs o’ thine own same  other folks” mary  rather frightened until she heard colin’s answer “nothing really ails them”  said “but they  so thin  weak they shake so  i’m afraid  try  stand  them” both mary  dickon drew  relieved breath “when tha’ stops bein’ afraid tha’lt stand  ’em” dickon said  renewed cheer “an’ tha’lt stop bein’ afraid   bit” “i shall” said colin   lay still  if   wondering about things they  really very quiet   little while the sun  dropping lower it   hour when everything stills itself  they really had had  busy  exciting afternoon colin looked  if   resting luxuriously even  creatures had ceased moving about  had drawn together   resting near them soot had perched   low branch  drawn up one leg  dropped  gray film drowsily over his eyes mary privately thought  looked  if  might snore   minute in  midst  this stillness   rather startling when colin half lifted his head  exclaimed   loud suddenly alarmed whisper “who   man” dickon  mary scrambled  their feet “man” they both cried  low quick voices colin pointed   high wall “look”  whispered excitedly “just look” mary  dickon wheeled about  looked there  ben weatherstaff’s indignant face glaring  them over  wall   top   ladder he actually shook his fist  mary “if i wasn’t  bachelder an’ tha’   wench o’ mine”  cried “i’d give thee  hidin’” he mounted another step threateningly  if   his energetic intention  jump down  deal  her but  she came toward him  evidently thought better    stood   top step  his ladder shaking his fist down  her “i never thowt much o’ thee”  harangued “i couldna’ abide thee th’ first time i set eyes  thee a scrawny buttermilkfaced young besom allus askin’ questions an’ pokin’ tha’ nose where  wasna wanted i never knowed how tha’ got so thick wi’ me if  hadna’ been  th’ robin— drat him—” “ben weatherstaff” called out mary finding her breath she stood below him  called up  him   sort  gasp “ben weatherstaff    robin who showed me  way” then  did seem  if ben really would scramble down  her side   wall   so outraged “tha’ young bad ’un”  called down  her “layin’ tha’ badness   robin—not but what he’s impidint enow  anythin’ him showin’ thee th’ way him eh tha’ young nowt”—she could see his next words burst out because   overpowered  curiosity—“however i’ this world did tha’ get in” “it   robin who showed me  way” she protested obstinately “he didn’t know   doing  but  did and i can’t tell you  here while you’re shaking your fist  me” he stopped shaking his fist very suddenly   very moment  his jaw actually dropped   stared over her head  something  saw coming over  grass toward him at  first sound  his torrent  words colin had been so surprised   had only sat up  listened  if   spellbound but   midst    had recovered himself  beckoned imperiously  dickon “wheel me over there”  commanded “wheel me quite close  stop right  front  him” and this if you please this  what ben weatherstaff beheld  which made his jaw drop a wheeled chair  luxurious cushions  robes which came toward him looking rather like some sort  state coach because  young rajah leaned back    royal command  his great blackrimmed eyes   thin white hand extended haughtily toward him and  stopped right under ben weatherstaff’s nose it  really no wonder his mouth dropped open “do you know who i am” demanded  rajah how ben weatherstaff stared his red old eyes fixed themselves  what  before him  if   seeing  ghost he gazed  gazed  gulped  lump down his throat  did not say  word “do you know who i am” demanded colin still more imperiously “answer” ben weatherstaff put his gnarled hand up  passed  over his eyes  over his forehead  then  did answer   queer shaky voice “who tha’ art”  said “aye  i do—wi’ tha’ mother’s eyes starin’  me out o’ tha’ face lord knows how tha’ come here but tha’rt th’ poor cripple” colin forgot   had ever had  back his face flushed scarlet   sat bolt upright “i’m not  cripple”  cried out furiously “i’m not” “he’s not” cried mary almost shouting up  wall  her fierce indignation “he’s not got  lump  big   pin i looked  there  none there—not one” ben weatherstaff passed his hand over his forehead again  gazed  if  could never gaze enough his hand shook  his mouth shook  his voice shook he   ignorant old man   tactless old man   could only remember  things  had heard “tha’—tha’ hasn’t got  crooked back”  said hoarsely “no” shouted colin “tha’—tha’ hasn’t got crooked legs” quavered ben more hoarsely yet it  too much the strength which colin usually threw into his tantrums rushed through him now   new way never yet had  been accused  crooked legs—even  whispers—and  perfectly simple belief  their existence which  revealed  ben weatherstaff’s voice  more than rajah flesh  blood could endure his anger  insulted pride made him forget everything but this one moment  filled him   power  had never known before  almost unnatural strength “come here”  shouted  dickon   actually began  tear  coverings off his lower limbs  disentangle himself “come here come here this minute” dickon   his side   second mary caught her breath   short gasp  felt herself turn pale “he can do it he can do it he can do it he can” she gabbled over  herself under her breath  fast  ever she could there   brief fierce scramble  rugs  tossed   ground dickon held colin’s arm  thin legs  out  thin feet    grass colin  standing upright—upright—as straight   arrow  looking strangely tall—his head thrown back  his strange eyes flashing lightning “look  me”  flung up  ben weatherstaff “just look  me—you just look  me” “he’s  straight  i am” cried dickon “he’s  straight  any lad i’ yorkshire” what ben weatherstaff did mary thought queer beyond measure he choked  gulped  suddenly tears ran down his weatherwrinkled cheeks   struck his old hands together “eh”  burst forth “th’ lies folk tells tha’rt  thin   lath an’  white   wraith but there’s not  knob  thee tha’lt make  mon yet god bless thee” dickon held colin’s arm strongly but  boy had not begun  falter he stood straighter  straighter  looked ben weatherstaff   face “i’m your master”  said “when my father  away and you   obey me this  my garden don’t dare  say  word about it you get down   ladder  go out   long walk  miss mary  meet you  bring you here i want  talk  you we did not want you but now you  have     secret be quick” ben weatherstaff’s crabbed old face  still wet   one queer rush  tears it seemed  if  could not take his eyes  thin straight colin standing  his feet  his head thrown back “eh lad”  almost whispered “eh my lad” and then remembering himself  suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion  said “yes sir yes sir”  obediently disappeared   descended  ladder chapter xxii when the sun went down when his head  out  sight colin turned  mary “go  meet him”  said  mary flew across  grass   door under  ivy dickon  watching him  sharp eyes there  scarlet spots  his cheeks   looked amazing but  showed no signs  falling “i can stand”  said  his head  still held up   said  quite grandly “i told thee tha’ could  soon  tha’ stopped bein’ afraid” answered dickon “an’ tha’s stopped” “yes i’ve stopped” said colin then suddenly  remembered something mary had said “are you making magic”  asked sharply dickon’s curly mouth spread   cheerful grin “tha’s doin’ magic thysel’”  said “it’s same magic  made these ’ere work out o’ th’ earth”   touched  his thick boot  clump  crocuses   grass colin looked down  them “aye”  said slowly “there couldna’  bigger magic than  there—there couldna’ be” he drew himself up straighter than ever “i’m going  walk   tree”  said pointing  one  few feet away  him “i’m going   standing when weatherstaff comes here i can rest against  tree if i like when i want  sit down i  sit down but not before bring  rug   chair” he walked   tree  though dickon held his arm   wonderfully steady when  stood against  tree trunk   not too plain   supported himself against it   still held himself so straight   looked tall when ben weatherstaff came through  door   wall  saw him standing there   heard mary muttering something under her breath “what art sayin’”  asked rather testily because  did not want his attention distracted   long thin straight boy figure  proud face but she did not tell him what she  saying  this “you can do it you can do it i told you you could you can do it you can do it you can” she  saying   colin because she wanted  make magic  keep him  his feet looking like that she could not bear   should give  before ben weatherstaff he did not give in she  uplifted   sudden feeling   looked quite beautiful  spite  his thinness he fixed his eyes  ben weatherstaff  his funny imperious way “look  me”  commanded “look  me all over am i  hunchback have i got crooked legs” ben weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion but  had recovered  little  answered almost  his usual way “not tha’”  said “nowt o’ th’ sort what’s tha’ been doin’  thysel’—hidin’ out o’ sight an’ lettin’ folk think tha’  cripple an’ halfwitted” “halfwitted” said colin angrily “who thought that” “lots o’ fools” said ben “th’ world’s full o’ jackasses brayin’ an’ they never bray nowt but lies what did tha’ shut thysel’ up for” “everyone thought i  going  die” said colin shortly “i’m not” and  said   such decision ben weatherstaff looked him over up  down down  up “tha’ die”  said  dry exultation “nowt o’ th’ sort tha’s got too much pluck  thee when i seed thee put tha’ legs  th’ ground  such  hurry i knowed tha’  all right sit thee down  th’ rug  bit young mester an’ give me thy orders” there   queer mixture  crabbed tenderness  shrewd understanding  his manner mary had poured out speech  rapidly  she could  they had come down  long walk the chief thing   remembered she had told him   colin  getting well—getting well the garden  doing it no one must let him remember about having humps  dying the rajah condescended  seat himself   rug under  tree “what work do you do   gardens weatherstaff”  inquired “anythin’ i’m told  do” answered old ben “i’m kep’   favor—because she liked me” “she” said colin “tha’ mother” answered ben weatherstaff “my mother” said colin   looked about him quietly “this  her garden wasn’t it” “aye   that”  ben weatherstaff looked about him too “she  main fond  it” “it  my garden now i am fond  it i shall come here every day” announced colin “but      secret my orders   no one   know  we come here dickon  my cousin have worked  made  come alive i shall send  you sometimes  help—but you must come when no one can see you” ben weatherstaff’s face twisted itself   dry old smile “i’ve come here before when no one saw me”  said “what” exclaimed colin “when” “th’ last time i  here” rubbing his chin  looking round “was about two year’ ago” “but no one  been    ten years” cried colin “there  no door” “i’m no one” said old ben dryly “an’ i didn’t come through th’ door i come over th’ wall th’ rheumatics held me back th’ last two year’” “tha’ come an’ did  bit o’ prunin’” cried dickon “i couldn’t make out how  had been done” “she  so fond  it—she was” said ben weatherstaff slowly “an’ she  such  pretty young thing she says  me once ‘ben’ says she laughin’ ‘if ever i’m ill or if i go away you must take care  my roses’ when she did go away th’ orders  no one  ever  come nigh but i come”  grumpy obstinacy “over th’ wall i come—until th’ rheumatics stopped me—an’ i did  bit o’ work once  year she’d gave her order first” “it wouldn’t have been  wick    if tha’ hadn’t done it” said dickon “i did wonder” “i’m glad you did it weatherstaff” said colin “you’ll know how  keep  secret” “aye i’ll know sir” answered ben “an’ it’ll  easier   man wi’ rheumatics  come   th’ door” on  grass near  tree mary had dropped her trowel colin stretched out his hand  took  up an odd expression came into his face   began  scratch   earth his thin hand  weak enough but presently  they watched him—mary  quite breathless interest—he drove  end   trowel into  soil  turned some over “you can do it you can do it” said mary  herself “i tell you you can” dickon’s round eyes  full  eager curiousness but  said not  word ben weatherstaff looked   interested face colin persevered after  had turned  few trowelfuls  soil  spoke exultantly  dickon  his best yorkshire “tha’ said  tha’d have me walkin’ about here same  other folk—an’ tha’ said tha’d have me diggin’ i thowt tha’  just leein’  please me this  only th’ first day an’ i’ve walked—an’ here i am diggin’” ben weatherstaff’s mouth fell open again when  heard him but  ended  chuckling “eh”  said “that sounds  if tha’d got wits enow tha’rt  yorkshire lad  sure an’ tha’rt diggin’ too how’d tha’ like  plant  bit o’ somethin’ i can get thee  rose   pot” “go  get it” said colin digging excitedly “quick quick” it  done quickly enough indeed ben weatherstaff went his way forgetting rheumatics dickon took his spade  dug  hole deeper  wider than  new digger  thin white hands could make it mary slipped out  run  bring back  wateringcan when dickon had deepened  hole colin went  turning  soft earth over  over he looked up   sky flushed  glowing   strangely new exercise slight   was “i want  do  before  sun goes quite—quite down”  said mary thought  perhaps  sun held back  few minutes just  purpose ben weatherstaff brought  rose   pot   greenhouse he hobbled over  grass  fast   could he had begun   excited too he knelt down   hole  broke  pot   mould “here lad”  said handing  plant  colin “set    earth thysel’ same  th’ king does when  goes   new place” the thin white hands shook  little  colin’s flush grew deeper   set  rose   mould  held  while old ben made firm  earth it  filled   pressed down  made steady mary  leaning forward  her hands  knees soot had flown down  marched forward  see what  being done nut  shell chattered about    cherrytree “it’s planted” said colin  last “and  sun  only slipping over  edge help me up dickon i want   standing when  goes that’s part   magic” and dickon helped him   magic—or whatever  was—so gave him strength  when  sun did slip over  edge  end  strange lovely afternoon  them there  actually stood  his two feet—laughing chapter xxiii magic dr craven had been waiting some time   house when they returned  it he had indeed begun  wonder if  might not  wise  send someone out  explore  garden paths when colin  brought back  his room  poor man looked him over seriously “you should not have stayed so long”  said “you must not overexert yourself” “i am not tired  all” said colin “it  made me well tomorrow i am going out   morning  well    afternoon” “i am not sure  i can allow it” answered dr craven “i am afraid  would not  wise” “it would not  wise  try  stop me” said colin quite seriously “i am going” even mary had found out  one  colin’s chief peculiarities    did not know   least what  rude little brute    his way  ordering people about he had lived   sort  desert island all his life    had been  king    had made his own manners  had had no one  compare himself with mary had indeed been rather like him herself  since she had been  misselthwaite had gradually discovered  her own manners had not been   kind which  usual or popular having made this discovery she naturally thought   enough interest  communicate  colin so she sat  looked  him curiously   few minutes after dr craven had gone she wanted  make him ask her why she  doing    course she did “what  you looking  me for”  said “i’m thinking  i am rather sorry  dr craven” “so am i” said colin calmly but not without  air  some satisfaction “he won’t get misselthwaite  all now i’m not going  die” “i’m sorry  him because  that  course” said mary “but i  thinking just then   must have been very horrid  have had   polite  ten years   boy who  always rude i would never have done it” “am i rude” colin inquired undisturbedly “if you had been his own boy   had been  slapping sort  man” said mary “he would have slapped you” “but  daren’t” said colin “no  daren’t” answered mistress mary thinking  thing out quite without prejudice “nobody ever dared  do anything you didn’t like—because you  going  die  things like that you  such  poor thing” “but” announced colin stubbornly “i am not going    poor thing i won’t let people think i’m one i stood  my feet this afternoon” “it  always having your own way   made you so queer” mary went on thinking aloud colin turned his head frowning “am i queer”  demanded “yes” answered mary “very but you needn’t  cross” she added impartially “because so am i queer—and so  ben weatherstaff but i am not  queer  i  before i began  like people  before i found  garden” “i don’t want   queer” said colin “i am not going  be”   frowned again  determination he   very proud boy he lay thinking   while  then mary saw his beautiful smile begin  gradually change his whole face “i shall stop being queer”  said “if i go every day   garden there  magic  there—good magic you know mary i am sure there is” “so am i” said mary “even if  isn’t real magic” colin said “we can pretend  is something  there—something” “it’s magic” said mary “but not black it’s  white  snow” they always called  magic  indeed  seemed like    months  followed—the wonderful months—the radiant months—the amazing ones oh  things which happened   garden if you have never had  garden you cannot understand  if you have had  garden you  know   would take  whole book  describe all  came  pass there at first  seemed  green things would never cease pushing their way through  earth   grass   beds even   crevices   walls then  green things began  show buds   buds began  unfurl  show color every shade  blue every shade  purple every tint  hue  crimson in  happy days flowers had been tucked away into every inch  hole  corner ben weatherstaff had seen  done  had himself scraped out mortar  between  bricks   wall  made pockets  earth  lovely clinging things  grow on iris  white lilies rose out   grass  sheaves   green alcoves filled themselves  amazing armies   blue  white flower lances  tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas “she  main fond o’ them—she was” ben weatherstaff said “she liked them things   allus pointin’ up  th’ blue sky she used  tell not  she  one o’ them  looked down  th’ earth—not her she just loved  but she said  th’ blue sky allus looked so joyful” the seeds dickon  mary had planted grew  if fairies had tended them satiny poppies  all tints danced   breeze   score gaily defying flowers which had lived   garden  years  which  might  confessed seemed rather  wonder how such new people had got there and  roses—the roses rising out   grass tangled round  sundial wreathing  tree trunks  hanging  their branches climbing up  walls  spreading over them  long garlands falling  cascades—they came alive day  day hour  hour fair fresh leaves  buds—and buds—tiny  first but swelling  working magic until they burst  uncurled into cups  scent delicately spilling themselves over their brims  filling  garden air colin saw  all watching each change   took place every morning   brought out  every hour  each day when  didn’t rain  spent   garden even gray days pleased him he would lie   grass “watching things growing”  said if you watched long enough  declared you could see buds unsheath themselves also you could make  acquaintance  strange busy insect things running about  various unknown but evidently serious errands sometimes carrying tiny scraps  straw or feather or food or climbing blades  grass  if they  trees  whose tops one could look out  explore  country a mole throwing up  mound   end   burrow  making  way out  last   longnailed paws which looked so like elfish hands had absorbed him one whole morning ants’ ways beetles’ ways bees’ ways frogs’ ways birds’ ways plants’ ways gave him  new world  explore  when dickon revealed them all  added foxes’ ways otters’ ways ferrets’ ways squirrels’ ways  trout’  waterrats’  badgers’ ways there  no end   things  talk about  think over and this  not  half   magic the fact   had really once stood  his feet had set colin thinking tremendously  when mary told him   spell she had worked   excited  approved   greatly he talked   constantly “of course there must  lots  magic   world”  said wisely one day “but people don’t know what   like or how  make it perhaps  beginning  just  say nice things  going  happen until you make them happen i am going  try  experiment” the next morning when they went   secret garden  sent  once  ben weatherstaff ben came  quickly   could  found  rajah standing  his feet under  tree  looking very grand but also very beautifully smiling “good morning ben weatherstaff”  said “i want you  dickon  miss mary  stand   row  listen  me because i am going  tell you something very important” “aye aye sir” answered ben weatherstaff touching his forehead one   long concealed charms  ben weatherstaff    his boyhood  had once run away  sea  had made voyages so  could reply like  sailor “i am going  try  scientific experiment” explained  rajah “when i grow up i am going  make great scientific discoveries  i am going  begin now  this experiment” “aye aye sir” said ben weatherstaff promptly though this   first time  had heard  great scientific discoveries it   first time mary had heard  them either but even  this stage she had begun  realize that queer   was colin had read about  great many singular things   somehow  very convincing sort  boy when  held up his head  fixed his strange eyes  you  seemed  if you believed him almost  spite  yourself though   only ten years old—going  eleven at this moment   especially convincing because  suddenly felt  fascination  actually making  sort  speech like  grownup person “the great scientific discoveries i am going  make”  went on “will  about magic magic   great thing  scarcely anyone knows anything about  except  few people  old books—and mary  little because she  born  india where there  fakirs i believe dickon knows some magic but perhaps  doesn’t know  knows it he charms animals  people i would never have let him come  see me if  had not been  animal charmer—which   boy charmer too because  boy   animal i am sure there  magic  everything only we have not sense enough  get hold    make  do things  us—like electricity  horses  steam” this sounded so imposing  ben weatherstaff became quite excited  really could not keep still “aye aye sir”  said   began  stand up quite straight “when mary found this garden  looked quite dead”  orator proceeded “then something began pushing things up out   soil  making things out  nothing one day things weren’t there  another they were i had never watched things before   made me feel very curious scientific people  always curious  i am going   scientific i keep saying  myself ‘what  it what  it’ it’s something it can’t  nothing i don’t know  name so i call  magic i have never seen  sun rise but mary  dickon have   what they tell me i am sure   magic too something pushes  up  draws it sometimes since i’ve been   garden i’ve looked up through  trees   sky  i have had  strange feeling  being happy  if something  pushing  drawing  my chest  making me breathe fast magic  always pushing  drawing  making things out  nothing everything  made out  magic leaves  trees flowers  birds badgers  foxes  squirrels  people so  must  all around us in this garden—in all  places the magic  this garden  made me stand up  know i am going  live    man i am going  make  scientific experiment  trying  get some  put   myself  make  push  draw me  make me strong i don’t know how  do  but i think  if you keep thinking about   calling  perhaps   come perhaps    first baby way  get it when i  going  try  stand  first time mary kept saying  herself  fast  she could ‘you can do it you can do it’  i did i had  try myself   same time  course but her magic helped me—and so did dickon’s every morning  evening   often   daytime  i can remember i am going  say ‘magic   me magic  making me well i am going    strong  dickon  strong  dickon’ and you must all do it too that  my experiment will you help ben weatherstaff” “aye aye sir” said ben weatherstaff “aye aye” “if you keep doing  every day  regularly  soldiers go through drill we shall see what  happen  find out if  experiment succeeds you learn things  saying them over  over  thinking about them until they stay  your mind forever  i think     same  magic if you keep calling   come  you  help you   get   part  you    stay  do things” “i once heard  officer  india tell my mother  there  fakirs who said words over  over thousands  times” said mary “i’ve heard jem fettleworth’s wife say th’ same thing over thousands o’ times—callin’ jem  drunken brute” said ben weatherstaff dryly “summat allus come o’ that sure enough he gave her  good hidin’ an’ went  th’ blue lion an’ got  drunk   lord” colin drew his brows together  thought  few minutes then  cheered up “well”  said “you see something did come  it she used  wrong magic until she made him beat her if she’d used  right magic  had said something nice perhaps  wouldn’t have got  drunk   lord  perhaps—perhaps  might have bought her  new bonnet” ben weatherstaff chuckled  there  shrewd admiration  his little old eyes “tha’rt  clever lad  well   straightlegged one mester colin”  said “next time i see bess fettleworth i’ll give her  bit   hint o’ what magic  do  her she’d  rare an’ pleased if th’ sinetifik ’speriment worked—an’ so ’ud jem” dickon had stood listening   lecture his round eyes shining  curious delight nut  shell   his shoulders   held  longeared white rabbit  his arm  stroked  stroked  softly while  laid  ears along  back  enjoyed itself “do you think  experiment  work” colin asked him wondering what   thinking he so often wondered what dickon  thinking when  saw him looking  him or  one  his “creatures”  his happy wide smile he smiled now  his smile  wider than usual “aye”  answered “that i do it’ll work same  th’ seeds do when th’ sun shines  ’em it’ll work  sure shall us begin  now” colin  delighted  so  mary fired  recollections  fakirs  devotees  illustrations colin suggested  they should all sit crosslegged under  tree which made  canopy “it   like sitting   sort  temple” said colin “i’m rather tired  i want  sit down” “eh” said dickon “tha’ mustn’t begin  sayin’ tha’rt tired tha’ might spoil th’ magic” colin turned  looked  him—into his innocent round eyes “that’s true”  said slowly “i must only think   magic” it all seemed most majestic  mysterious when they sat down  their circle ben weatherstaff felt  if  had somehow been led into appearing   prayermeeting ordinarily   very fixed  being what  called “agen’ prayermeetin’s” but this being  rajah’s affair  did not resent    indeed inclined   gratified  being called upon  assist mistress mary felt solemnly enraptured dickon held his rabbit  his arm  perhaps  made some charmer’s signal no one heard  when  sat down crosslegged like  rest  crow  fox  squirrels   lamb slowly drew near  made part   circle settling each into  place  rest  if  their own desire “the ‘creatures’ have come” said colin gravely “they want  help us” colin really looked quite beautiful mary thought he held his head high  if  felt like  sort  priest  his strange eyes had  wonderful look  them the light shone  him through  tree canopy “now we  begin”  said “shall we sway backward  forward mary  if we  dervishes” “i canna’ do no swayin’ back’ard  for’ard” said ben weatherstaff “i’ve got th’ rheumatics” “the magic  take them away” said colin   high priest tone “but we won’t sway until   done it we  only chant” “i canna’ do no chantin’” said ben weatherstaff  trifle testily “they turned me out o’ th’ church choir th’ only time i ever tried it” no one smiled they  all too much  earnest colin’s face  not even crossed   shadow he  thinking only   magic “then i  chant”  said and  began looking like  strange boy spirit “the sun  shining—the sun  shining that   magic the flowers  growing—the roots  stirring that   magic being alive   magic—being strong   magic the magic   me—the magic   me it   me—it   me it’s  everyone  us it’s  ben weatherstaff’s back magic magic come  help” he said   great many times—not  thousand times but quite  goodly number mary listened entranced she felt  if    once queer  beautiful  she wanted him  go   on ben weatherstaff began  feel soothed into  sort  dream which  quite agreeable the humming   bees   blossoms mingled   chanting voice  drowsily melted into  doze dickon sat crosslegged  his rabbit asleep  his arm   hand resting   lamb’s back soot had pushed away  squirrel  huddled close  him  his shoulder  gray film dropped over his eyes at last colin stopped “now i am going  walk round  garden”  announced ben weatherstaff’s head had just dropped forward   lifted    jerk “you have been asleep” said colin “nowt o’ th’ sort” mumbled ben “th’ sermon  good enow—but i’m bound  get out afore th’ collection” he  not quite awake yet “you’re not  church” said colin “not me” said ben straightening himself “who said i were i heard every bit  it you said th’ magic   my back th’ doctor calls  rheumatics” the rajah waved his hand “that   wrong

 fox cub keeping close  dickon  white rabbit hopping along or stopping  nibble  soot following   solemnity   person who felt himself  charge it   procession which moved slowly but  dignity every few yards  stopped  rest colin leaned  dickon’s arm  privately ben weatherstaff kept  sharp lookout but now  then colin took his hand   support  walked  few steps alone his head  held up all  time   looked very grand “the magic   me”  kept saying “the magic  making me strong i can feel it i can feel it” it seemed very certain  something  upholding  uplifting him he sat   seats   alcoves  once or twice  sat down   grass  several times  paused   path  leaned  dickon but  would not give up until  had gone all round  garden when  returned   canopy tree his cheeks  flushed   looked triumphant “i did it the magic worked”  cried “that  my first scientific discovery” “what  dr craven say” broke out mary “he won’t say anything” colin answered “because   not  told this     biggest secret  all no one   know anything about  until i have grown so strong  i can walk  run like any other boy i shall come here every day  my chair  i shall  taken back  it i won’t have people whispering  asking

am quite well  i shall live    man it  been done   scientific experiment’” “he  think     dream” cried mary “he won’t believe his eyes” colin flushed triumphantly he had made himself believe    going  get well which  really more than half  battle if  had been aware  it and  thought which stimulated him more than any other  this imagining what his father would look like when  saw   had  son who   straight  strong  other fathers’ sons one  his darkest miseries   unhealthy morbid past days had been his hatred  being  sickly weakbacked boy whose father  afraid  look  him “he’ll  obliged  believe

wi’ winnin’ th’ belt an’ bein’ champion prizefighter  all england” colin fixed his eyes  him sternly “weatherstaff”  said “that  disrespectful you must not take liberties because you    secret however much  magic works i shall not   prizefighter i shall   scientific discoverer” “ax pardon—ax pardon sir” answered ben touching his forehead  salute “i ought  have seed  wasn’t  jokin’ matter” but his eyes twinkled  secretly   immensely pleased he really did not mind being snubbed since  snubbing meant   lad  gaining strength  spirit chapter xxiv “let them laugh” the secret garden  not  only one dickon worked in round  cottage   moor there   piece  ground enclosed   low wall  rough stones early   morning  late   fading twilight   all  days colin  mary did not see him dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes  cabbages turnips  carrots  herbs  his mother in  company  his “creatures”  did wonders there   never tired  doing them  seemed while  dug or weeded  whistled or sang bits  yorkshire moor songs or talked  soot or captain or  brothers  sisters  had taught  help him “we’d never get   comfortable  we do” mrs sowerby said “if  wasn’t  dickon’s garden anything’ll grow  him his ’taters  cabbages  twice th’ size  anyone else’s an’ they’ve got  flavor  ’em  nobody’s has” when she found  moment  spare she liked  go out  talk  him after supper there  still  long clear twilight  work     her quiet time she could sit upon  low rough wall  look   hear stories   day she loved this time there  not only vegetables  this garden dickon had bought penny packages  flower seeds now  then  sown bright sweetscented things among gooseberry bushes  even cabbages   grew borders  mignonette  pinks  pansies  things whose seeds  could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring  spread  time into fine clumps the low wall  one   prettiest things  yorkshire because  had tucked moorland foxglove  ferns  rockcress  hedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here  there glimpses   stones    seen “all  chap’s got  do  make ’em thrive mother”  would say “is   friends  ’em  sure they’re just like th’ ‘creatures’ if they’re thirsty give ’em drink  if they’re hungry give ’em  bit o’ food they want  live same  we do if they died i should feel  if i’d been  bad lad  somehow treated them heartless” it   these twilight hours  mrs sowerby heard  all  happened  misselthwaite manor at first she  only told  “mester colin” had taken  fancy  going out into  grounds  miss mary     doing him good but   not long before   agreed between  two children  dickon’s mother might “come into  secret” somehow   not doubted  she  “safe  sure” so one beautiful still evening dickon told  whole story  all  thrilling details   buried key   robin   gray haze which had seemed like deadness   secret mistress mary had planned never  reveal the coming  dickon  how  had been told  him  doubt  mester colin   final drama  his introduction   hidden domain combined   incident  ben weatherstaff’s angry face peering over  wall  mester colin’s sudden indignant strength made mrs sowerby’s nicelooking face quite change color several times “my word” she said “it   good thing  little lass came  th’ manor it’s been th’ makin’ o’ her an’ th’ savin o’ him standin’  his feet an’ us all thinkin’    poor halfwitted lad  not  straight bone  him” she asked  great many questions  her blue eyes  full  deep thinking “what do they make    th’ manor—him being so well an’ cheerful an’ never complainin’” she inquired “they don’t know what  make  it” answered dickon “every day  comes round his face looks different it’s fillin’ out  doesn’t look so sharp an’ th’ waxy color  goin’ but    do his bit o’ complainin’”   highly entertained grin “what for i’ mercy’s name” asked mrs sowerby dickon chuckled “he does   keep them  guessin’ what’s happened if  doctor knew he’d found out  could stand  his feet he’d likely write  tell mester craven mester colin’s savin’ th’ secret  tell himself he’s goin’  practise his magic  his legs every day till his father comes back an’ then he’s goin’  march into his room an’ show him he’s  straight  other lads but him an’ miss mary thinks it’s best plan  do  bit o’ groanin’ an’ frettin’ now an’ then  throw folk off th’ scent” mrs sowerby  laughing  low comfortable laugh long before  had finished his last sentence “eh” she said “that pair’s enjoyin’ theirselves i’ll warrant they’ll get  good bit o’ actin’ out   an’ there’s nothin’ children likes  much  play actin’ let’s hear what they do dickon lad” dickon stopped weeding  sat up  his heels  tell her his eyes  twinkling  fun “mester colin  carried down  his chair every time  goes out”  explained “an’  flies out  john th’ footman  not carryin’ him careful enough he makes himself  helpless lookin’   can an’ never lifts his head until we’re out o’ sight o’ th’ house an’  grunts an’ frets  good bit when he’s bein’ settled into his chair him an’ miss mary’s both got  enjoyin’  an’ when  groans an’ complains she’ll say ‘poor colin does  hurt you so much are you so weak  that poor colin’—but th’ trouble   sometimes they can scarce keep  burstin’ out laughin’ when we get safe into  garden they laugh till they’ve no breath left  laugh with an’ they have  stuff their faces into mester colin’s cushions  keep  gardeners  hearin’ if any of ’em’s about” “th’ more they laugh th’ better  ’em” said mrs sowerby still laughing herself “good healthy child laughin’s better than pills any day o’ th’ year that pair’ll plump up  sure” “they  plumpin’ up” said dickon “they’re  hungry they don’t know how  get enough  eat without makin’ talk mester colin says if  keeps sendin’  more food they won’t believe he’s  invalid  all miss mary says she’ll let him eat her share but  says  if she goes hungry she’ll get thin an’ they mun both get fat  once” mrs sowerby laughed so heartily   revelation  this difficulty  she quite rocked backward  forward  her blue cloak  dickon laughed  her “i’ll tell thee what lad” mrs sowerby said when she could speak “i’ve thought   way  help ’em when tha’ goes  ’em  th’ mornin’s tha’ shall take  pail o’ good new milk an’ i’ll bake ’em  crusty cottage loaf or some buns wi’ currants  ’em same  you children like nothin’s so good  fresh milk an’ bread then they could take off th’ edge o’ their hunger while they   their garden an’ th fine food they get indoors ’ud polish off th’ corners” “eh mother” said dickon admiringly “what  wonder tha’ art tha’ always sees  way out o’ things they  quite   pother yesterday they didn’t see how they   manage without orderin’ up more food—they felt  empty inside” “they’re two young ’uns growin’ fast an’ health’s comin’ back  both  ’em children like  feels like young wolves an’ food’s flesh an’ blood  ’em” said mrs sowerby then she smiled dickon’s own curving smile “eh but they’re enjoyin’ theirselves  sure” she said she  quite right  comfortable wonderful mother creature—and she had never been more so than when she said their “play actin’” would  their joy colin  mary found  one  their most thrilling sources  entertainment the idea  protecting themselves  suspicion had been unconsciously suggested  them first   puzzled nurse  then  dr craven himself “your appetite is improving very much master colin”  nurse had said one day “you used  eat nothing  so many things disagreed  you” “nothing disagrees  me now” replied colin  then seeing  nurse looking  him curiously  suddenly remembered  perhaps  ought not  appear too well just yet “at least things don’t so often disagree  me it’s  fresh air” “perhaps  is” said  nurse still looking  him   mystified expression “but i must talk  dr craven about it” “how she stared  you” said mary when she went away “as if she thought there must  something  find out” “i won’t have her finding out things” said colin “no one must begin  find out yet” when dr craven came  morning  seemed puzzled also he asked  number  questions  colin’s great annoyance “you stay out   garden  great deal”  suggested “where do you go” colin put  his favorite air  dignified indifference  opinion “i  not let anyone know where i go”  answered “i go   place i like everyone  orders  keep out   way i won’t  watched  stared at you know that” “you seem   out all day but i do not think   done you harm—i do not think so the nurse says  you eat much more than you have ever done before” “perhaps” said colin prompted   sudden inspiration “perhaps    unnatural appetite” “i do not think so  your food seems  agree  you” said dr craven “you  gaining flesh rapidly  your color  better” “perhaps—perhaps i am bloated  feverish” said colin assuming  discouraging air  gloom “people who  not going  live  often—different” dr craven shook his head he  holding colin’s wrist   pushed up his sleeve  felt his arm “you  not feverish”  said thoughtfully “and such flesh  you have gained  healthy if you can keep this up my boy we need not talk  dying your father   happy  hear  this remarkable improvement” “i won’t have him told” colin broke forth fiercely “it  only disappoint him if i get worse again—and i may get worse this very night i might have  raging fever i feel  if i might  beginning  have one now i won’t have letters written  my father—i won’t—i won’t you  making me angry  you know   bad  me i feel hot already i hate being written about  being talked over  much  i hate being stared at” “hushh my boy” dr craven soothed him “nothing shall  written without your permission you  too sensitive about things you must not undo  good which  been done” he said no more about writing  mr craven  when  saw  nurse  privately warned her  such  possibility must not  mentioned   patient “the boy  extraordinarily better”  said “his advance seems almost abnormal but  course   doing now  his own free  what we could not make him do before still  excites himself very easily  nothing must  said  irritate him” mary  colin  much alarmed  talked together anxiously from this time dated their plan  “play actin’” “i may  obliged  have  tantrum” said colin regretfully “i don’t want  have one  i’m not miserable enough now  work myself into  big one perhaps i couldn’t have one  all that lump doesn’t come  my throat now  i keep thinking  nice things instead  horrible ones but if they talk about writing  my father i shall have  do something” he made up his mind  eat less but unfortunately   not possible  carry out this brilliant idea when  wakened each morning   amazing appetite   table near his sofa  set   breakfast  homemade bread  fresh butter snowwhite eggs raspberry jam  clotted cream mary always breakfasted  him  when they found themselves   table—particularly if there  delicate slices  sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors  under  hot silver cover—they would look into each other’s eyes  desperation “i think we shall have  eat  all this morning mary” colin always ended  saying “we can send away some   lunch   great deal   dinner” but they never found they could send away anything   highly polished condition   empty plates returned   pantry awakened much comment “i do wish” colin would say also “i do wish  slices  ham  thicker  one muffin each  not enough  anyone” “it’s enough   person who  going  die” answered mary when first she heard this “but it’s not enough   person who  going  live i sometimes feel  if i could eat three when those nice fresh heather  gorse smells   moor come pouring    open window” the morning  dickon—after they had been enjoying themselves   garden  about two hours—went behind  big rosebush  brought forth two tin pails  revealed  one  full  rich new milk  cream   top  it    other held cottagemade currant buns folded   clean blue  white napkin buns so carefully tucked   they  still hot there   riot  surprised joyfulness what  wonderful thing  mrs sowerby  think of what  kind clever woman she must be how good  buns were and what delicious fresh milk “magic   her just     dickon” said colin “it makes her think  ways  do things—nice things she   magic person tell her we  grateful dickon—extremely grateful” he  given  using rather grownup phrases  times he enjoyed them he liked this so much   improved upon it “tell her she  been most bounteous  our gratitude  extreme” and then forgetting his grandeur  fell   stuffed himself  buns  drank milk out   pail  copious draughts   manner  any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise  breathing  moorland air  whose breakfast  more than two hours behind him this   beginning  many agreeable incidents   same kind they actually awoke   fact   mrs sowerby had fourteen people  provide food  she might not have enough  satisfy two extra appetites every day so they asked her  let them send some  their shillings  buy things dickon made  stimulating discovery    wood   park outside  garden where mary had first found him piping   wild creatures there   deep little hollow where you could build  sort  tiny oven  stones  roast potatoes  eggs  it roasted eggs   previously unknown luxury  very hot potatoes  salt  fresh butter  them  fit   woodland king—besides being deliciously satisfying you could buy both potatoes  eggs  eat  many  you liked without feeling  if you  taking food out   mouths  fourteen people every beautiful morning  magic  worked   mystic circle under  plumtree which provided

stronger  could walk more steadily  cover more ground and each day his belief   magic grew stronger—as well  might he tried one experiment after another   felt himself gaining strength    dickon who showed him  best things  all “yesterday”  said one morning after  absence “i went  thwaite  mother an’ near th’ blue cow inn i seed bob haworth he’s  strongest chap  th’ moor he’s  champion wrestler an’  can jump higher than any other chap an’ throw th’ hammer farther he’s gone all th’ way  scotland  th’ sports some years he’s knowed me ever since i   little ’un an’ he’s  friendly sort an’ i axed

names an’  didn’t ask none he’s friendly same  i said an’  stood up an’ showed me goodnatured like an’ i imitated what  did till i knowed   heart” colin had been listening excitedly “can you show me”  cried “will you” “aye   sure” dickon answered getting up “but  says tha’ mun do ’em gentle  first an’  careful not  tire thysel’ rest  between times an’ take deep breaths an’ don’t overdo” “i’ll  careful” said colin “show me show me dickon you   most magic boy   world” dickon stood up   grass  slowly went through  carefully practical but simple series  muscle exercises colin watched them  widening eyes he could do  few while   sitting down presently  did  few gently while  stood upon his already steadied feet mary began  do them also soot who  watching  performance became much disturbed  left his branch  hopped about restlessly because  could not do them too from  time  exercises  part   day’s duties  much   magic was it became possible  both colin  mary  do more  them each

turning  look  her mary became quite severe  her manner “it  something between  sneeze   cough” she replied  reproachful dignity “and  got into my throat” “but” she said afterward  colin “i couldn’t stop myself it just burst out because all  once i couldn’t help remembering  last big potato you ate   way your mouth stretched when you bit through  thick lovely crust  jam  clotted cream  it” “is there any way  which those children can get food secretly” dr craven inquired  mrs medlock “there’s no way unless they dig  out   earth or pick  off  trees” mrs medlock answered “they stay out   grounds all day  see no one but each other and if they want anything different  eat  what’s sent up  them they need only ask  it” “well” said dr craven “so long  going without food agrees  them we need not disturb ourselves the boy   new creature” “so   girl” said mrs medlock “she’s begun   downright pretty since she’s filled out  lost her ugly little sour look her hair’s grown thick  healthy

them warm  her feathery little breast  careful wings at first she  very nervous   robin himself  indignantly watchful even dickon did not go near  closegrown corner  those days but waited until   quiet working  some mysterious spell  seemed  have conveyed   soul   little pair    garden there  nothing which  not quite like themselves—nothing which did not understand  wonderfulness  what  happening  them—the immense tender terrible heartbreaking beauty  solemnity  eggs if there had been one person   garden who had not known through all his or her innermost being  if  egg  taken away or hurt  whole world would whirl round  crash through space  come   end—if there had been even one who did not feel   act accordingly there could have been no happiness even   golden springtime air but they all knew   felt    robin  his mate knew they knew it at first  robin watched mary  colin  sharp anxiety for some mysterious reason  knew  need not watch dickon the first moment  set his dewbright black eye  dickon  knew   not  stranger but  sort  robin without beak or feathers he could speak robin which   quite distinct language not   mistaken  any other to speak robin   robin  like speaking french   frenchman dickon always spoke    robin himself so  queer gibberish  used when  spoke  humans did not matter   least the robin thought  spoke this gibberish  them because they  not intelligent enough  understand feathered speech his movements also  robin they never startled one  being sudden enough  seem dangerous or threatening any robin could understand dickon so his presence  not even disturbing but   outset  seemed necessary    guard against  other two in  first place  boy creature did not come into  garden  his legs he  pushed    thing  wheels   skins  wild animals  thrown over him that  itself  doubtful then when  began  stand up  move about  did    queer unaccustomed way   others seemed  have  help him the robin used  secrete himself   bush  watch this anxiously his head tilted first  one side  then   other he thought   slow movements might mean    preparing  pounce  cats do when cats  preparing  pounce they creep over  ground very slowly the robin talked this over  his mate  great deal   few days but after   decided not  speak   subject because her terror  so great    afraid  might  injurious   eggs when  boy began  walk  himself  even  move more quickly    immense relief but   long time—or  seemed  long time   robin—he   source  some anxiety he did not act   other humans did he seemed very fond  walking but  had  way  sitting or lying down   while  then getting up   disconcerting manner  begin again one day  robin remembered  when  himself had been made  learn  fly  his parents  had done much  same sort  thing he had taken short flights   few yards  then had been obliged  rest so  occurred  him  this boy  learning  fly—or rather  walk he mentioned this  his mate  when  told her   eggs would probably conduct themselves   same way after they  fledged she  quite comforted  even became eagerly interested  derived great pleasure  watching  boy over  edge  her nest—though she always thought   eggs would  much cleverer  learn more quickly but then she said indulgently  humans  always more clumsy  slow than eggs  most  them never seemed really  learn  fly  all you never met them   air or  treetops after  while  boy began  move about   others did but all three   children  times did unusual things they would stand under  trees  move their arms  legs  heads about   way which  neither walking nor running nor sitting down they went through these movements  intervals every day   robin  never able  explain  his mate what they  doing or tying  do he could only say    sure   eggs would never flap about  such  manner but   boy who could speak robin so fluently  doing  thing  them birds could  quite sure   actions  not   dangerous nature of course neither  robin nor his mate had ever heard   champion wrestler bob haworth  his

peace  content fears   eggs became things   past knowing  your eggs   safe  if they  locked   bank vault   fact  you could watch so many curious things going  made setting  most entertaining occupation on wet days  eggs’ mother sometimes felt even  little dull because  children did not come into  garden but even  wet days  could not  said  mary  colin  dull one morning when  rain streamed down unceasingly  colin  beginning  feel  little restive    obliged  remain  his sofa because   not safe  get up  walk about mary had  inspiration “now  i am  real boy” colin had said “my legs  arms  all my body  so full  magic  i can’t keep them still they want   doing things all  time do you know  when i waken   morning mary when it’s quite early   birds  just shouting outside  everything seems just shouting  joy—even  trees  things we can’t really hear—i feel  if i must jump out  bed  shout myself if i did it just think what would happen” mary giggled inordinately “the nurse would come running  mrs medlock would come running  they would  sure you had gone crazy  they’d send   doctor” she said colin giggled himself he could see how they would all look—how horrified  his outbreak  how amazed  see him standing upright “i wish my father would come home”  said “i want  tell him myself i’m always thinking about it—but we couldn’t go  like this much longer i can’t stand lying still  pretending  besides i look too different i wish  wasn’t raining today” it  then mistress mary had her inspiration “colin” she began mysteriously “do you know how many rooms there   this house” “about  thousand i suppose”  answered “there’s about  hundred no one ever goes into” said mary “and one rainy day i went  looked into ever so many  them no one ever knew though mrs medlock nearly found me out i lost my way when i  coming back  i stopped   end  your corridor that   second time i heard you crying” colin started up  his sofa “a hundred rooms no one goes into”  said “it sounds almost like  secret garden suppose we go  look  them wheel me  my chair  nobody would know we went” “that’s what i  thinking” said mary “no one would dare  follow us there  galleries where you could run we could do our exercises there   little indian room where there   cabinet full  ivory elephants there  all sorts  rooms” “ring  bell” said colin when  nurse came   gave his orders “i want my chair”  said “miss mary  i  going  look   part   house which  not used john can push me  far   picturegallery because there  some stairs then  must go away  leave us alone until i send  him again” rainy days lost their terrors  morning when  footman had wheeled  chair into  picturegallery  left  two together  obedience  orders colin  mary looked  each other delighted as soon  mary had made sure  john  really  his way back  his own quarters below stairs colin got out  his chair “i am going  run  one end   gallery   other”  said “and then i am going  jump  then we  do bob haworth’s exercises” and they did all these things  many others they looked   portraits  found  plain little girl dressed  green brocade  holding  parrot  her finger “all these” said colin “must  my relations they lived  long time ago that parrot one i believe  one  my great great great great aunts she looks rather like you mary—not  you look now but  you looked when you came here now you   great deal fatter  better looking” “so  you” said mary  they both laughed they went   indian room  amused themselves   ivory elephants they found  rosecolored brocade boudoir   hole   cushion  mouse had left but  mice had grown up  run away   hole  empty they saw more rooms  made more discoveries than mary had made  her first pilgrimage they found new corridors  corners  flights  steps  new old pictures they liked  weird old things they did not know  use of it   curiously entertaining morning   feeling  wandering about   same house  other people but   same time feeling  if one  miles away  them   fascinating thing “i’m glad we came” colin said “i never knew i lived  such  big queer old place i like it we  ramble about every rainy day we shall always  finding new queer corners  things” that morning they had found among other things such good appetites  when they returned  colin’s room   not possible  send  luncheon away untouched when  nurse carried  tray downstairs she slapped  down   kitchen dresser so  mrs loomis  cook could see  highly polished dishes  plates “look  that” she said “this   house  mystery  those two children   greatest mysteries  it” “if they keep  up every day” said  strong young footman john “there’d  small wonder   weighs twice  much today   did  month ago i should have  give up my place  time  fear  doing my muscles  injury” that afternoon mary noticed  something new had happened  colin’s room she had noticed   day before but had said nothing because she thought  change might have been made  chance she said nothing today but she sat  looked fixedly   picture over  mantel she could look   because  curtain had been drawn aside that   change she noticed “i know what you want me  tell you” said colin after she had stared  few minutes “i always know when you want me  tell you something you  wondering why  curtain  drawn back i am going  keep  like that” “why” asked mary “because  doesn’t make me angry any more  see her laughing i wakened when   bright moonlight two nights ago  felt  if  magic  filling  room  making everything so splendid  i couldn’t lie still i got up  looked out   window the room  quite light  there   patch  moonlight   curtain  somehow  made me go  pull  cord she looked right down  me  if she  laughing because she  glad i  standing there it made me like  look  her i want  see her laughing like  all  time i think she must have been  sort  magic person perhaps” “you  so like her now” said mary “that sometimes i think perhaps you  her ghost made into  boy” that idea seemed  impress colin he thought  over  then answered her slowly “if i  her ghost—my father would  fond  me”  said “do you want him   fond  you” inquired mary “i used  hate  because   not fond  me if  grew fond  me i think i should tell him about  magic it might make him more cheerful” chapter xxvi “it’s mother” their belief   magic   abiding thing after  morning’s incantations colin sometimes gave them magic lectures “i like  do it”  explained “because when i grow up  make great scientific discoveries i shall  obliged  lecture about them  so this  practise i can only give short lectures now because i am very young  besides ben weatherstaff would feel  if    church   would go  sleep” “th’ best thing about lecturin’” said ben “is   chap can get up an’ say aught  pleases an’ no other chap can answer him back i wouldn’t  agen’ lecturin’  bit mysel’ sometimes” but when colin held forth under his tree old ben fixed devouring eyes  him  kept them there he looked him over  critical affection it  not so much  lecture which interested him   legs which looked straighter  stronger each day  boyish head which held itself up so well  once sharp chin  hollow cheeks which had filled  rounded out   eyes which had begun  hold  light  remembered  another pair sometimes when colin felt ben’s earnest gaze meant    much impressed  wondered what   reflecting   once when  had seemed quite entranced  questioned him “what  you thinking about ben weatherstaff”  asked “i  thinkin’” answered ben “as i’d warrant tha’s gone up three or four pound this week i  lookin’  tha’ calves an’ tha’ shoulders i’d like  get thee   pair o’ scales” “it’s  magic and—and mrs sowerby’s buns  milk  things” said colin “you see  scientific experiment  succeeded” that morning dickon  too late  hear  lecture when  came   ruddy  running  his funny face looked more twinkling than usual as they had  good deal  weeding  do after  rains they fell  work they always had plenty  do after  warm deep sinking rain the moisture which  good   flowers  also good   weeds which thrust up tiny blades  grass  points  leaves which must  pulled up before their roots took too firm hold colin   good  weeding  anyone  these days   could lecture while   doing it “the magic works best when you work yourself”  said this morning “you can feel   your bones  muscles i am going  read books about bones  muscles but i am going  write  book about magic i am making  up now i keep finding out things” it  not very long after  had said this   laid down his trowel  stood up  his feet he had been silent  several minutes  they had seen    thinking out lectures   often did when  dropped his trowel  stood upright  seemed  mary  dickon  if  sudden strong thought had made him do it he stretched himself out  his tallest height   threw out his arms exultantly color glowed  his face  his strange eyes widened  joyfulness all  once  had realized something   full “mary dickon”  cried “just look  me” they stopped their weeding  looked  him “do you remember  first morning you brought me  here”  demanded dickon  looking  him very hard being  animal charmer  could see more things than most people could  many  them  things  never talked about he saw some  them now  this boy “aye  we do”  answered mary looked hard too but she said nothing “just this minute” said colin “all  once i remembered  myself—when i looked  my hand digging   trowel—and i had  stand up  my feet  see if   real and   real i’m well—i’m well” “aye  th’ art” said dickon “i’m well i’m well” said colin again  his face went quite red all over he had known  before   way  had hoped   felt   thought about it but just   minute something had rushed all through him—a sort  rapturous belief  realization   had been so strong   could not help calling out “i shall live forever  ever  ever”  cried grandly “i shall find out thousands  thousands  things i shall find out about people  creatures  everything  grows—like dickon—and i shall never stop making magic i’m well i’m well i feel—i feel  if i want  shout out something—something thankful joyful” ben weatherstaff who had been working near  rosebush glanced round  him “tha’ might sing th’ doxology”  suggested  his dryest grunt he had no opinion   doxology   did not make  suggestion  any particular reverence but colin    exploring mind   knew nothing about  doxology “what  that”  inquired “dickon can sing   thee i’ll warrant” replied ben weatherstaff dickon answered  his allperceiving animal charmer’s smile “they sing  i’ church”  said “mother says she believes th’ skylarks sings  when they gets up i’ th’ mornin’” “if she says that  must   nice song” colin answered “i’ve never been   church myself i  always too ill sing it dickon i want  hear it” dickon  quite simple  unaffected about it he understood what colin felt better than colin did himself he understood   sort  instinct so natural   did not know   understanding he pulled off his cap  looked round still smiling “tha’ must take off tha’ cap”  said  colin “an’ so mun tha’ ben—an’ tha’ mun stand up tha’ knows” colin took off his cap   sun shone   warmed his thick hair   watched dickon intently ben weatherstaff scrambled up  his knees  bared his head too   sort  puzzled halfresentful look  his old face  if  didn’t know exactly why   doing this remarkable thing dickon stood out among  trees  rosebushes  began  sing  quite  simple matteroffact way    nice strong boy voice “praise god  whom all blessings flow praise him all creatures here below praise him above ye heavenly host praise father son  holy ghost amen” when  had finished ben weatherstaff  standing quite still  his jaws set obstinately but   disturbed look  his eyes fixed  colin colin’s face  thoughtful  appreciative “it   very nice song”  said “i like it perhaps  means just what i mean when i want  shout out  i am thankful   magic” he stopped  thought   puzzled way “perhaps they  both  same thing how can we know  exact names  everything sing  again dickon let us try mary i want  sing it too it’s my song how does  begin ‘praise god  whom all blessings flow’” and they sang  again  mary  colin lifted their voices  musically  they could  dickon’s swelled quite loud  beautiful—and   second line ben weatherstaff raspingly cleared his throat    third line  joined   such vigor   seemed almost savage  when  “amen” came   end mary observed   very same thing had happened  him which had happened when  found out  colin  not  cripple—his chin  twitching    staring  winking  his leathery old cheeks  wet “i never seed no sense  th’ doxology afore”  said hoarsely “but i may change my mind i’ time i should say tha’d gone up five pound this week mester colin—five  ’em” colin  looking across  garden  something attracting his attention  his expression had become  startled one “who  coming  here”  said quickly “who  it” the door   ivied wall had been pushed gently open   woman had entered she had come    last line  their song  she had stood still listening  looking  them with  ivy behind her  sunlight drifting through  trees  dappling her long blue cloak  her nice fresh face smiling across  greenery she  rather like  softly colored illustration  one  colin’s books she had wonderful affectionate eyes which seemed  take everything in—all  them even ben weatherstaff   “creatures”  every flower    bloom unexpectedly  she had appeared not one  them felt  she   intruder  all dickon’s eyes lighted like lamps “it’s mother—that’s who  is”  cried  went across  grass   run colin began  move toward her too  mary went  him they both felt their pulses beat faster “it’s mother” dickon said again when they met halfway “i knowed tha’ wanted  see her an’ i told her where th’ door  hid” colin held out his hand   sort  flushed royal shyness but his eyes quite devoured her face “even when i  ill i wanted  see you”  said “you  dickon   secret garden i’d never wanted  see anyone or anything before” the sight  his uplifted face brought about  sudden change  her own she flushed   corners  her mouth shook   mist seemed  sweep over her eyes “eh dear lad” she broke out tremulously “eh dear lad”  if she had not known she  going  say it she did not say “mester colin” but just “dear lad” quite suddenly she might have said   dickon   same way if she had seen something  his face which touched her colin liked it “are you surprised because i am so well”  asked she put her hand  his shoulder  smiled  mist out  her eyes “aye  i am” she said “but tha’rt so like thy mother tha’ made my heart jump” “do you think” said colin  little awkwardly “that  make my father like me” “aye  sure dear lad” she answered  she gave his shoulder  soft quick pat “he mun come home—he mun come home” “susan sowerby” said ben weatherstaff getting close  her “look  th’ lad’s legs wilt tha’ they  like drumsticks i’ stockin’ two month’ ago—an’ i heard folk tell  they  bandy an’ knockkneed both  th’ same time look  ’em now” susan sowerby laughed  comfortable laugh “they’re goin’   fine strong lad’s legs   bit” she said “let him go  playin’ an’ workin’   garden an’ eatin’ hearty an’ drinkin’ plenty o’ good sweet milk an’ there’ll not   finer pair i’ yorkshire thank god  it” she put both hands  mistress mary’s shoulders  looked her little face over   motherly fashion “an’ thee too” she said “tha’rt grown near  hearty  our ’lisabeth ellen i’ll warrant tha’rt like thy mother too our martha told me  mrs medlock heard she   pretty woman tha’lt  like  blush rose when tha’ grows up my little lass bless thee” she did not mention  when martha came home  her “day out”  described  plain sallow child she had said  she had no confidence whatever  what mrs medlock had heard “it doesn’t stand  reason   pretty woman could  th’ mother o’ such  fou’ little lass” she had added obstinately mary had not had time  pay much attention  her changing face she had only known  she looked “different”  seemed  have  great deal more hair     growing very fast but remembering her pleasure  looking   mem sahib   past she  glad  hear  she might some day look like her susan sowerby went round their garden  them   told  whole story    shown every bush  tree which had come alive colin walked  one side  her  mary   other each  them kept looking up  her comfortable rosy face secretly curious about  delightful feeling she gave them—a sort  warm supported feeling it seemed  if she understood them  dickon understood his “creatures” she stooped over  flowers  talked about them  if they  children soot followed her  once or twice cawed  her  flew upon her shoulder  if   dickon’s when they told her about  robin   first flight   young ones she laughed  motherly little mellow laugh  her throat “i suppose learnin’ ’em  fly  like learnin’ children  walk but i’m feared i should  all   worrit if mine had wings instead o’ legs” she said it  because she seemed such  wonderful woman  her nice moorland cottage way   last she  told about  magic “do you believe  magic” asked colin after  had explained about indian fakirs “i do hope you do” “that i do lad” she answered “i never knowed    name but what does th’ name matter i warrant they call   different name i’ france an’  different one i’ germany th’ same thing  set th’ seeds swellin’ an’ th’ sun shinin’ made thee  well lad an’ it’s th’ good thing it isn’t like us poor fools  think  matters if us  called out  our names th’ big good thing doesn’t stop  worrit bless thee it goes  makin’ worlds  th’ million—worlds like us never thee stop believin’  th’ big good thing an’ knowin’ th’ world’s full  it—an’ call  what tha’ likes tha’ wert singin’   when i come into th’ garden” “i felt so joyful” said colin opening his beautiful strange eyes  her “suddenly i felt how different i was—how strong my arms  legs were you know—and how i could dig  stand—and i jumped up  wanted  shout out something  anything  would listen” “th’ magic listened when tha’ sung th’ doxology it would ha’ listened  anything tha’d sung it  th’ joy  mattered eh lad lad—what’s names  th’ joy maker”  she gave his shoulders  quick soft pat again she had packed  basket which held  regular feast this morning  when  hungry hour came  dickon brought  out   hiding place she sat down  them under their tree  watched them devour their food laughing  quite gloating over their appetites she  full  fun  made them laugh  all sorts  odd things she told them stories  broad yorkshire  taught them new words she laughed  if she could not help  when they told her   increasing difficulty there   pretending  colin  still  fretful invalid “you see we can’t help laughing nearly all  time when we  together” explained colin “and  doesn’t sound ill  all we try  choke  back but   burst out   sounds worse than ever” “there’s one thing  comes into my mind so often” said mary “and i can scarcely ever hold  when i think   suddenly i keep thinking suppose colin’s face should get  look like  full moon it isn’t like one yet but  gets  tiny bit fatter every day—and suppose some morning  should look like one—what should we do” “bless us all i can see tha’   good bit o’ play actin’  do” said susan sowerby “but tha’ won’t have  keep  up much longer mester craven’ll come home” “do you think  will” asked colin “why” susan sowerby chuckled softly “i suppose  ’ud nigh break thy heart if  found out before tha’ told him  tha’ own way” she said “tha’s laid awake nights plannin’ it” “i couldn’t bear anyone else  tell him” said colin “i think about different ways every day i think now i just want  run into his room” “that’d   fine start  him” said susan sowerby “i’d like  see his face lad i would that he mun come back—that  mun” one   things they talked    visit they   make  her cottage they planned  all they   drive over  moor  lunch out  doors among  heather they would see all  twelve children  dickon’s garden  would not come back until they  tired susan sowerby got up  last  return   house  mrs medlock it  time  colin   wheeled back also but before  got into his chair  stood quite close  susan  fixed his eyes  her   kind  bewildered adoration   suddenly caught hold   fold  her blue cloak  held  fast “you  just what i—what i wanted”  said “i wish you  my mother—as well  dickon’s” all  once susan sowerby bent down  drew him  her warm arms close against  bosom under  blue cloak—as if  had been dickon’s brother the quick mist swept over her eyes “eh dear lad” she said “thy own mother’s  this ’ere very garden i do believe she couldna’ keep out  it thy father mun come back  thee—he mun” chapter xxvii in the garden in each century since  beginning   world wonderful

  tall man   drawn face  crooked shoulders   name  always entered  hotel registers was “archibald craven misselthwaite manor yorkshire england” he had traveled far  wide since  day  saw mistress mary  his study  told her she might have her “bit  earth” he had been   most beautiful places  europe though  had remained nowhere more than  few days he had chosen  quietest  remotest spots he had been   tops  mountains whose heads    clouds  had looked down  other mountains when  sun rose  touched them  such light  made  seem  if  world  just being born but  light had never seemed  touch himself until one day when  realized    first time  ten years  strange thing had happened he    wonderful valley   austrian tyrol   had been walking alone through such beauty  might have lifted any man’s soul out  shadow he had walked  long way   had not lifted his but  last  had felt tired  had thrown himself down  rest   carpet  moss   stream it   clear little stream which ran quite merrily along   narrow way through  luscious damp greenness sometimes  made  sound rather like very low laughter   bubbled over  round stones he saw birds come  dip their heads  drink    then flick their wings  fly away it seemed like  thing alive  yet  tiny voice made  stillness seem deeper the valley  very very still as  sat gazing into  clear running   water archibald craven gradually felt his mind  body both grow quiet  quiet   valley itself he wondered if   going  sleep but   not he sat  gazed   sunlit water  his eyes began  see things growing   edge there  one lovely mass  blue forgetmenots growing so close   stream   leaves  wet   these  found himself looking   remembered  had looked  such things years ago he  actually thinking tenderly how lovely    what wonders  blue  hundreds  little blossoms were he did not know  just  simple thought  slowly filling his mind—filling  filling  until other things  softly pushed aside it   if  sweet clear spring had begun  rise   stagnant pool  had risen  risen until  last  swept  dark water away but  course  did not think  this himself he only knew   valley seemed  grow quieter  quieter   sat  stared   bright delicate blueness he did not know how long  sat there or what  happening  him but  last  moved  if   awakening   got up slowly  stood   moss carpet drawing  long deep soft breath  wondering  himself something seemed  have been unbound  released  him very quietly “what  it”  said almost   whisper   passed his hand over his forehead “i almost feel  if—i  alive” i do not know enough about  wonderfulness  undiscovered things   able  explain how this had happened  him neither does anyone else yet he did not understand  all himself—but  remembered this strange hour months afterward when    misselthwaite again   found out quite  accident   this very day colin had cried out   went into  secret garden “i am going  live forever  ever  ever” the singular calmness remained  him  rest   evening   slept  new reposeful sleep but   not  him very long he did not know   could  kept by  next night  had opened  doors wide  his dark thoughts  they had come trooping  rushing back he left  valley  went  his wandering way again but strange   seemed  him there  minutes—sometimes halfhours—when without his knowing why  black burden seemed  lift itself again   knew    living man  not  dead one slowly—slowly—for no reason   knew of—he  “coming alive”   garden as  golden summer changed into  deep golden autumn  went   lake  como there  found  loveliness   dream he spent his days upon  crystal blueness   lake or  walked back into  soft thick verdure   hills  tramped until   tired so   might sleep but  this time  had begun  sleep better  knew  his dreams had ceased    terror  him “perhaps”  thought “my body  growing stronger” it  growing stronger but—because   rare peaceful hours when his thoughts  changed—his soul  slowly growing stronger too he began  think  misselthwaite  wonder if  should not go home now  then  wondered vaguely about his boy  asked himself what  should feel when  went  stood   carved fourposted bed again  looked down   sharply chiseled ivorywhite face while  slept and  black lashes rimmed so startlingly  closeshut eyes he shrank  it one marvel   day  had walked so far  when  returned  moon  high  full  all  world  purple shadow  silver the stillness  lake  shore  wood  so wonderful   did not go into  villa  lived in he walked down   little bowered terrace   water’s edge  sat upon  seat  breathed  all  heavenly scents   night he felt  strange calmness stealing over him   grew deeper  deeper until  fell asleep he did not know when  fell asleep  when  began  dream his dream  so real   did not feel  if   dreaming he remembered afterward how intensely wide awake  alert  had thought  was he thought    sat  breathed   scent   late roses  listened   lapping   water  his feet  heard  voice calling it  sweet  clear  happy  far away it seemed very far but  heard   distinctly  if  had been  his very side “archie archie archie”  said  then again sweeter  clearer than before “archie archie” he thought  sprang  his feet not even startled it  such  real voice   seemed so natural   should hear it “lilias lilias”  answered “lilias where  you” “in  garden”  came back like  sound   golden flute “in  garden” and then  dream ended but  did not awaken he slept soundly  sweetly all through  lovely night when  did awake  last   brilliant morning   servant  standing staring  him he   italian servant   accustomed  all  servants   villa were  accepting without question any strange thing his foreign master might do no one ever knew when  would go out or come  or where  would choose  sleep or if  would roam about  garden or lie   boat   lake all night the man held  salver  some letters     waited quietly until mr craven took them when  had gone away mr craven sat  few moments holding them  his hand  looking   lake his strange calm  still upon him  something more—a lightness  if  cruel thing which had been done had not happened   thought—as if something had changed he  remembering  dream—the real—real dream “in  garden”  said wondering  himself “in  garden but  door  locked   key  buried deep” when  glanced   letters  few minutes later  saw   one lying   top   rest   english letter  came  yorkshire it  directed   plain woman’s hand but   not  hand  knew he opened it scarcely thinking   writer but  first words attracted his attention  once “dear sir i am susan sowerby  made bold  speak  you once   moor it  about miss mary i spoke i  make bold  speak again please sir i would come home if i  you i think you would  glad  come and—if you  excuse me sir—i think your lady would ask you  come if she  here your obedient servant susan sowerby” mr craven read  letter twice before  put  back   envelope he kept thinking about  dream “i  go back  misselthwaite”  said “yes i’ll go  once” and  went through  garden   villa  ordered pitcher  prepare  his return  england in  few days    yorkshire again   his long railroad journey  found himself thinking  his boy   had never thought  all  ten years past during those years  had only wished  forget him now though  did not intend  think about him memories  him constantly drifted into his mind he remembered  black days when  had raved like  madman because  child  alive   mother  dead he had refused  see it  when  had gone  look    last  had been such  weak wretched thing  everyone had been sure  would die   few days but   surprise  those who took care    days passed   lived  then everyone believed  would   deformed  crippled creature he had not meant    bad father but  had not felt like  father  all he had supplied doctors  nurses  luxuries but  had shrunk   mere thought   boy  had buried himself  his own misery the first time after  year’s absence  returned  misselthwaite   small miserable looking thing languidly  indifferently lifted  his face  great gray eyes  black lashes round them so like  yet so horribly unlike  happy eyes  had adored  could not bear  sight  them  turned away pale  death after   scarcely ever saw him except when   asleep  all  knew  him      confirmed invalid   vicious hysterical halfinsane temper he could only  kept  furies dangerous  himself  being given his own way  every detail all this  not  uplifting thing  recall but   train whirled him through mountain passes  golden plains  man who  “coming alive” began  think   new way   thought long  steadily  deeply “perhaps i have been all wrong  ten years”  said  himself “ten years   long time it may  too late  do anything—quite too late what have i been thinking of” of course this   wrong magic—to begin  saying “too late” even colin could have told him that but  knew nothing  magic—either black or white this  had yet  learn he wondered if susan sowerby had taken courage  written  him only because  motherly creature had realized   boy  much worse—was fatally ill if  had not been under  spell   curious calmness which had taken possession  him  would have been more wretched than ever but  calm had brought  sort  courage  hope  it instead  giving way  thoughts   worst  actually found   trying  believe  better things “could   possible  she sees  i may  able  do him good  control him”  thought “i  go  see her  my way  misselthwaite” but when  his way across  moor  stopped  carriage   cottage seven or eight children who  playing about gathered   group  bobbing seven or eight friendly  polite curtsies told him  their mother had gone   other side   moor early   morning  help  woman who had  new baby “our dickon” they volunteered  over   manor working  one   gardens where  went several days each week mr craven looked over  collection  sturdy little bodies

behind the drive across  wonderfulness   moor   soothing thing why did  seem  give him  sense  homecoming which  had been sure  could never feel again—that sense   beauty  land  sky  purple bloom

fourposted bed   brocaded hangings was  possible  perhaps  might find him changed  little   better    might overcome his shrinking  him how real  dream had been—how wonderful  clear  voice which called back  him “in  garden—in  garden” “i  try  find  key”  said “i  try  open  door i must—though i don’t know why” when  arrived   manor  servants who received him   usual ceremony noticed   looked better    did not go   remote rooms where  usually lived attended  pitcher he went into  library  sent  mrs medlock she came  him somewhat excited  curious  flustered “how  master colin medlock”  inquired “well sir” mrs medlock answered “he’s—he’s different   manner  speaking” “worse”  suggested mrs medlock really  flushed “well you see sir” she tried  explain “neither dr craven nor  nurse nor me can exactly make him out” “why  that” “to tell  truth sir master colin might  better   might  changing   worse his appetite sir  past understanding—and his ways—” “has  become more—more peculiar” her master asked knitting his brows anxiously “that’s it sir he’s growing very peculiar—when you compare him  what  used  be he used  eat nothing  then suddenly  began  eat something enormous—and then  stopped again all  once   meals  sent back just  they used  be you never knew sir perhaps  out  doors  never would let himself  taken the things we’ve gone through  get him  go out  his chair would leave  body trembling like  leaf he’d throw himself into such  state  dr craven said  couldn’t  responsible  forcing him well sir just without warning—not long after one  his worst tantrums  suddenly insisted  being taken out every day  miss mary  susan sowerby’s boy dickon  could push his chair he took  fancy  both miss mary  dickon  dickon brought his tame animals and if you’ll credit it sir out  doors   stay  morning until night” “how does  look”   next question “if  took his food natural sir you’d think   putting  flesh—but we’re afraid  may   sort  bloat he laughs sometimes   queer way when he’s alone  miss mary he never used  laugh  all dr craven  coming  see you  once if you’ll allow him he never   puzzled  his life” “where  master colin now” mr craven asked “in  garden sir he’s always   garden—though not  human creature  allowed  go near  fear they’ll look  him” mr craven scarcely heard her last words “in  garden”  said  after  had sent mrs medlock away  stood  repeated  again  again “in  garden” he had  make  effort  bring himself back   place   standing   when  felt    earth again  turned  went out   room he took his way  mary had done through  door   shrubbery  among  laurels   fountain beds the fountain  playing now   encircled  beds  brilliant autumn flowers he crossed  lawn  turned into  long walk   ivied walls he did not walk quickly but slowly  his eyes    path he felt  if   being drawn back   place  had so long forsaken   did not know why as  drew near   his step became still more slow he knew where  door  even though  ivy hung thick over it—but  did not know exactly where  lay—that buried key so  stopped  stood still looking about him  almost  moment after  had paused  started  listened—asking himself if   walking   dream the ivy hung thick over  door  key  buried under  shrubs no human being had passed  portal  ten lonely years—and yet inside  garden there  sounds they   sounds  running scuffling feet seeming  chase round  round under  trees they  strange sounds  lowered suppressed voices—exclamations  smothered joyous cries it seemed actually like  laughter  young things  uncontrollable laughter  children who  trying not   heard but who   moment or so—as their excitement mounted—would burst forth what  heaven’s name   dreaming of—what  heaven’s name did  hear was  losing his reason  thinking  heard things which  not  human ears was    far clear voice had meant and then  moment came  uncontrollable moment when  sounds forgot  hush themselves the feet ran faster  faster—they  nearing  garden door—there  quick strong young breathing   wild outbreak  laughing shouts which could not  contained—and  door   wall  flung wide open  sheet  ivy swinging back   boy burst through   full speed and without seeing  outsider dashed almost into his arms mr craven had extended them just  time  save him  falling   result  his unseeing dash against him  when  held him away  look  him  amazement  his being there  truly gasped  breath he   tall boy   handsome one he  glowing  life  his running had sent splendid color leaping  his face he threw  thick hair back  his forehead  lifted  pair  strange gray eyes—eyes full  boyish laughter  rimmed  black lashes like  fringe it   eyes which made mr craven gasp  breath “who—what who”  stammered this  not what colin had expected—this  not what  had planned he had never thought  such  meeting and yet  come dashing out—winning  race—perhaps   even better he drew himself up  his very tallest mary who had been running  him  had dashed through  door too believed   managed  make himself look taller than  had ever looked before—inches taller “father”  said “i’m colin you can’t believe it i scarcely can myself i’m colin” like mrs medlock  did not understand what his father meant when  said hurriedly “in  garden in  garden” “yes” hurried  colin “it   garden  did it—and mary  dickon   creatures—and  magic no one knows we kept   tell you when you came i’m well i can beat mary   race i’m going    athlete” he said  all so like  healthy boy—his face flushed his words tumbling over each other  his eagerness—that mr craven’s soul shook  unbelieving joy colin put out his hand  laid   his father’s arm “aren’t you glad father”  ended “aren’t you glad i’m going  live forever  ever  ever” mr craven put his hands  both  boy’s shoulders  held him still he knew  dared not even try  speak   moment “take me into  garden my boy”  said  last “and tell me all about it” and so they led him in the place   wilderness  autumn gold  purple  violet blue  flaming scarlet

they came into  grayness he looked round  round “i thought  would  dead”  said “mary thought so  first” said colin “but  came alive” then they sat down under their tree—all but colin who wanted  stand

“together” said mrs medlock hastily overfilling his beermug  her excitement “together ma’am”  ben gulped down half  his new mug  one gulp “where  master colin how did  look what did they say  each
