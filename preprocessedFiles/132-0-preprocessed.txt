indeed  what  did here   fair specimen taken   opening sentences  chapter — de l’habileté dans le gouvernement des troupes suntse dit  ayez les noms de tous les officiers tant généraux que subalternes inscrivezles dans un catalogue à part avec la note des talents  de la capacité de chacun d’eux afin de pouvoir les employer avec avantage lorsque l’occasion en sera venue faites en sorte que tous ceux que vous devez commander soient persuadés que votre principale attention est de les préserver de tout dommage les troupes que vous ferez avancer contre l’ennemi doivent être comme des pierres que vous lanceriez contre des œufs de vous à l’ennemi il ne doit y avoir d’autre différence que celle du fort au faible du vide au plein attaquez à découvert mais soyez vainqueur en secret voilà en peu de mots en quoi consiste l’habileté  toute la perfection même du gouvernement des troupes throughout  nineteenth century which saw  wonderful development   study  chinese literature no translator ventured

acknowledges  without  aid  two japanese gentlemen “the accompanying translation would have been impossible” we can only wonder then   their help  should have been so excessively bad it  not merely  question  downright blunders  which none can hope   wholly exempt omissions  frequent hard passages  wilfully distorted or slurred over such offences  less pardonable they would not  tolerated  any edition   greek or latin classic   similar standard  honesty ought   insisted upon  translations  chinese from blemishes  this nature  least i believe   present translation  free it  not undertaken out  any inflated estimate  my own powers but i could not help feeling  sun tzŭ deserved  better fate than had befallen him  i knew that  any rate i could hardly fail  improve   work  my predecessors towards  end    new  revised edition  capt calthrop’s translation  published  london this time however without any allusion  his japanese collaborators my first three chapters  then already

muster some   grosser blunders have been rectified  lacunae filled up but   other hand  certain number  new mistakes appear the very first sentence   introduction  startlingly inaccurate  later on while mention  made  “an army  japanese commentators”  sun tzŭ who  these   way not  word  vouchsafed about  chinese commentators who nevertheless i venture  assert form  much more numerous  infinitely more important “army” a few special features   present volume may now  noticed in  first place  text  been cut up into numbered paragraphs both  order  facilitate crossreference    convenience  students generally the division follows broadly   sun hsingyen’s edition but i have sometimes found  desirable  join two or more  his paragraphs into one in quoting  other works chinese

on  review   whole without modifying  substance  my criticisms i might have been inclined   few instances  temper their asperity having chosen  wield  bludgeon however i shall not cry out if  return i

affirmative so arrangements  made  bring  ladies out   palace sun tzŭ divided them into two companies  placed one   king’s favourite concubines   head  each he then bade them all take spears  their

left turn you must face towards your left hand when i say right turn you must face towards your right hand when i say about turn you must face right round towards your back again  girls assented the words  command having been thus explained  set up  halberds  battleaxes  order  begin  drill then   sound  drums  gave  order right turn but  girls only burst out laughing sun tzŭ said if words

laughter sun tzŭ if words  command  not clear  distinct if orders  not thoroughly understood  general   blame but if his orders are clear   soldiers nevertheless disobey then    fault  their officers

down  following message we  now quite satisfied   our general’s ability  handle troops if we  bereft  these two concubines our meat  drink  lose their savor it  our wish  they shall not  beheaded sun tzŭ replied having once received his majesty’s commission    general  his forces there  certain commands  his majesty which acting   capacity i am unable  accept accordingly  had  two leaders beheaded  straightway installed  pair next  order  leaders  their place when this had been done  drum  sounded   drill once more   girls went through all  evolutions turning   right or   left marching ahead or wheeling back kneeling or standing  perfect accuracy  precision not venturing  utter  sound then sun tzŭ sent  messenger   king saying your soldiers sire  now properly drilled  disciplined  ready  your majesty’s inspection they can  put  any use  their sovereign may desire bid them go through fire  water  they  not disobey but  king replied let our general cease drilling  return  camp as  us we have no wish  come down  inspect  troops thereupon sun tzŭ said the king  only fond  words  cannot translate them into deeds after that ho lu saw  sun tzŭ  one who knew how  handle  army  finally

confucius   yet no advocate  peace  any price— military weapons   means used   sage  punish violence  cruelty  give peace  troublous times  remove difficulties  dangers   succour those who   peril every animal  blood   veins  horns   head  fight when   attacked how much more so  man who carries  his breast  faculties  love  hatred joy  anger when   pleased  feeling  affection springs up within

relative values who can only bark out their stale formulas about virtue  civilization condemning  use  military weapons they  surely bring our country  impotence  dishonour   loss  her rightful heritage or   very least they  bring about invasion  rebellion sacrifice  territory  general enfeeblement yet they obstinately refuse  modify  position they have taken up the truth  that just

  marquis  ch’i  overawed again when  inhabitants  pi revolted  ordered his officers  attack them whereupon they  defeated  fled  confusion he once uttered  words if i fight i conquer  and jan yu also said the sage exercises both civil  military functions  can    fact  confucius never studied or received instruction   art  war we can only say   did not specially choose matters connected  armies  fighting    subject  his teaching sun hsingyen  editor  sun tzŭ writes  similar strain— confucius said i am unversed  military matters  he also said if i fight i conquer confucius ordered ceremonies

inspired teacher does not know those who have  lead  army  devise stratagems must learn  art  war but if one can command  services   good general like sun tzŭ who  employed  wu tzŭhsu there  no need  learn  oneself hence  remark added  confucius if i fight i conquer the men   present day however willfully interpret these words  confucius  their narrowest sense  though  meant  books   art  war  not

haste  preferable  clever dilatoriness now sun tzŭ says nothing whatever except possibly  implication about illconsidered haste being better than ingenious but lengthy operations what  does say  something much more guarded namely that while speed may sometimes  injudicious tardiness can never  anything but foolish—if only because  means impoverishment   nation in considering  point raised

says rewards  necessary  order  make  soldiers see  advantage  beating  enemy thus when you capture spoils   enemy they must  used  rewards so  all your men may have  keen desire  fight each  his own

enemy’s plans perhaps  word balk falls short  expressing  full force   chinese word which implies not  attitude  defence whereby one might  content  foil  enemy’s stratagems one after another but  active policy  counterattack ho shih puts this very clearly  his note when  enemy  made  plan  attack against us we must anticipate him  delivering our own attack first  next best   prevent  junction

any further advantage if twice  numerous  divide our army into two tu mu takes exception   saying   first sight indeed  appears  violate  fundamental principle  war ts’ao kung however gives  clue  sun tzŭ’s meaning being two   enemy’s one we may use one part  our army   regular way   other  some special diversion chang yu thus further elucidates  point if our force  twice  numerous     enemy  should  split up into two divisions one  meet  enemy  front  one  fall upon his rear if  replies   frontal attack  may  crushed  behind if   rearward attack  may  crushed  front this  what  meant  saying  ‘one part may  used   regular way   other  some special diversion’ tu mu does not understand  dividing one’s army  simply  irregular just  concentrating    regular strategical method    too hasty  calling this  mistake  if equally matched we can offer battle li ch’uan followed  ho shih gives  following paraphrase if attackers  attacked  equally matched  strength only  able general  fight if slightly inferior  numbers we can avoid  enemy the meaning we can watch  enemy  certainly  great improvement   above but unfortunately there appears   no very good authority   variant chang yu reminds us   saying only applies if  other factors  equal  small difference  numbers  often more than counterbalanced  superior energy  discipline if quite unequal  every way we can flee  him  hence though  obstinate fight may  made   small force   end  must  captured   larger force  now  general   bulwark   state if  bulwark  complete  all points  state   strong if  bulwark  defective  state   weak as li ch’uan tersely puts it gap indicates deficiency if  general’s ability  not perfect ie if   not thoroughly versed  his profession his army  lack strength  there  three ways  which  ruler can bring misfortune upon his army—   by commanding  army  advance or  retreat being ignorant   fact   cannot obey this  called hobbling  army li ch’uan adds  comment it  like tying together  legs   thoroughbred so    unable  gallop one would naturally think  the ruler  this passage  being  home  trying  direct  movements  his army   distance but  commentators understand just  reverse  quote  saying  t’ai kung a kingdom should not  governed  without  army should not  directed  within of course   true that during  engagement or when  close touch   enemy  general should not    thick  his own troops but  little distance apart otherwise    liable  misjudge  position   whole  give wrong orders   by attempting  govern  army   same way   administers  kingdom being ignorant   conditions which obtain   army this causes restlessness   soldier’s minds ts’ao kung’s note is freely translated the military sphere   civil sphere  wholly distinct you can’t handle  army  kid gloves and chang yu says humanity  justice   principles  which  govern  state but not  army opportunism  flexibility   other hand  military rather than civil virtues  assimilate  governing   army—to    state understood   by employing  officers  his army without discrimination that is   not careful  use  right man   right place through ignorance   military principle  adaptation  circumstances this shakes  confidence   soldiers i follow mei yaoch’en here the other commentators refer not   ruler   §§   but   officers  employs thus tu yu says if  general  ignorant   principle  adaptability  must not  entrusted   position  authority tu mu quotes the skilful employer  men  employ  wise man  brave man  covetous man   stupid man for  wise man delights  establishing his merit  brave man likes  show his courage  action  covetous man  quick  seizing advantages   stupid man  no fear  death  but when  army  restless  distrustful trouble  sure  come   other feudal princes this  simply bringing anarchy into  army  flinging victory away  thus we may know  there  five essentials  victory  he  win who knows when  fight  when not  fight chang yu says if  can fight  advances  takes  offensive if  cannot fight  retreats  remains   defensive he  invariably conquer who knows whether   right  take  offensive or  defensive  he  win who knows how  handle both superior  inferior forces this  not merely  general’s ability  estimate numbers correctly  li ch’uan  others make out chang yu expounds  saying more satisfactorily by applying  art  war   possible   lesser force  defeat  greater  vice versa the secret lies   eye  locality   not letting  right moment slip thus wu tzŭ says ‘with  superior force make  easy ground   inferior one make  difficult ground’  he  win whose army  animated   same spirit throughout all  ranks  he  win who prepared himself waits  take  enemy unprepared  he  win who  military capacity   not interfered    sovereign tu yu quotes wang tzŭ  saying it   sovereign’s function  give broad instructions but  decide  battle    function   general it  needless  dilate   military disasters which have been caused  undue interference  operations   field   part   home government napoleon undoubtedly owed much  his extraordinary success   fact    not hampered  central authority victory lies   knowledge  these five points literally “these five things  knowledge   principle  victory”  hence  saying if you know  enemy  know yourself you need not fear  result   hundred battles if you know yourself but not  enemy  every victory gained you  also suffer  defeat li ch’uan cites  case  fu chien prince  ch’in who   ad marched   vast army against  chin emperor when warned not  despise  enemy who could command  services  such men  hsieh an  huan ch’ung  boastfully replied i have

nevertheless his forces  soon after disastrously routed   fei river    obliged  beat  hasty retreat if you know neither  enemy nor yourself you  succumb  every battle chang yu said knowing  enemy enables you  take  offensive knowing yourself enables you  stand   defensive he adds attack   secret  defence defence   planning   attack it would  hard  find  better epitome   rootprinciple  war chapter iv tactical dispositions ts’ao kung explains  chinese meaning   words   title  this chapter marching  countermarching   part   two armies   view  discovering each other’s condition tu mu says it  through  dispositions   army   condition may  discovered conceal your dispositions  your condition  remain secret which leads  victory show your dispositions  your condition  become patent which leads  defeat wang hsi remarks   good general can secure success  modifying his tactics  meet those   enemy  sun tzŭ said the good fighters  old first put themselves beyond  possibility  defeat  then waited   opportunity  defeating  enemy  to secure ourselves against defeat lies  our own hands but  opportunity  defeating  enemy  provided   enemy himself that is  course   mistake   enemy’s part  thus  good fighter  able  secure himself against defeat chang yu says this  done by concealing  disposition  his troops covering up his tracks  taking unremitting precautions but cannot make certain  defeating  enemy  hence  saying one may know how  conquer without being able  do it  security against defeat implies defensive tactics ability  defeat  enemy means taking  offensive i retain  sense found   similar passage  §§   spite   fact   commentators  all against me the meaning they give he who cannot conquer takes  defensive  plausible enough  standing   defensive indicates insufficient strength attacking  superabundance  strength  the general who  skilled  defence hides   most secret recesses   earth literally hides under  ninth earth which   metaphor indicating  utmost secrecy  concealment so   enemy may not know his whereabouts  who  skilled  attack flashes forth   topmost heights  heaven another metaphor implying   falls  his adversary like  thunderbolt against which there  no time  prepare this   opinion  most   commentators thus   one hand we have ability  protect ourselves   other  victory   complete  to see victory only when   within  ken   common herd  not  acme

but han hsin had already worked out  his mind  details   clever stratagem whereby   foresaw   able  capture  city  inflict  crushing defeat  his adversary  neither    acme  excellence if you fight

he who only sees  obvious wins his battles  difficulty  who looks below  surface  things wins  ease  hence his victories bring him neither reputation  wisdom nor credit  courage tu mu explains this very well inasmuch  his victories  gained over circumstances  have not come  light  world  large knows nothing  them   wins no reputation  wisdom inasmuch   hostile state submits before there  been any bloodshed  receives no credit  courage  he wins his battles  making no mistakes ch’en hao says he plans no superfluous marches  devises no futile attacks the connection  ideas  thus explained  chang yu one who seeks  conquer  sheer strength clever though  may   winning pitched battles  also liable  occasion   vanquished whereas  who can look into  future  discern conditions   not yet manifest  never make  blunder  therefore invariably win making no mistakes  what establishes  certainty  victory   means conquering  enemy   already defeated  hence  skilful fighter puts himself into  position which makes defeat impossible  does not miss  moment  defeating  enemy a counsel  perfection  tu mu truly observes position need not  confined   actual ground occupied   troops it includes all  arrangements  preparations which  wise general  make  increase  safety  his army  thus     war  victorious strategist only seeks battle after  victory  been won whereas  who  destined  defeat first fights  afterwards looks  victory ho shih thus expounds  paradox in warfare first lay plans which  ensure victory  then lead your army  battle if you  not begin  stratagem but rely  brute strength alone victory  no longer  assured  the consummate leader cultivates  moral law  strictly adheres  method  discipline thus    his power  control success  in respect  military method we have

throws out  hint   meaning  his brief note these things all serve  destroy formation  conceal one’s condition but tu mu   first  put  quite plainly if you wish  feign confusion  order  lure  enemy on you must first have perfect discipline if you wish  display timidity  order  entrap  enemy you must have extreme courage if you wish  parade your weakness  order  make  enemy overconfident you must have exceeding strength  hiding order beneath  cloak  disorder  simply  question  subdivision see supra §  concealing courage under  show  timidity presupposes  fund  latent energy the commentators strongly understand  certain chinese word here differently than anywhere else  this chapter thus tu mu says seeing  we  favourably circumstanced  yet make no move  enemy  believe  we  really afraid masking strength  weakness    effected  tactical dispositions chang yu relates  following anecdote  kao tsu  first han emperor “wishing  crush  hsiungnu  sent out spies  report  their condition but  hsiungnu forewarned carefully concealed all their ablebodied men  wellfed horses  only allowed infirm soldiers  emaciated cattle   seen the result   spies one  all recommended  emperor  deliver his

surely some ruse   part   enemy   would  unwise  us  attack’ the emperor however disregarding this advice fell into  trap  found himself surrounded  poteng”  thus one who  skilful  keeping  enemy   move maintains deceitful appearances according  which  enemy  act ts’ao kung’s note  make  display  weakness  want tu mu says if our force happens   superior   enemy’s weakness may  simulated  order

important point which  enemy  have  defend  if  enemy  taking his ease  can harass him this passage may  cited  evidence against mei yao ch’en’s interpretation  i §  if well supplied  food  can starve

strong enough or  precautions not strict enough where relief comes too late or provisions  too scanty or  defenders  variance amongst themselves you can ensure  safety  your defence if you only hold positions  cannot  attacked ie where there  none   weak points mentioned above there  rather  nice point involved   interpretation  this later clause tu mu ch’en hao  mei yaoch’en assume  meaning  be in order  make your defence quite safe you must defend even those places   not likely   attacked  tu mu adds how much more then those    attacked taken thus however  clause balances less well   preceding—always  consideration   highly antithetical style which  natural   chinese chang yu therefore seems  come nearer  mark  saying he who  skilled  attack flashes forth   topmost heights  heaven see iv §  making  impossible   enemy  guard against him this being so  places  i shall attack  precisely those   enemy cannot defend… he who  skilled  defence hides   most secret recesses   earth

attack against  sovereign himself it  clear  sun tzŭ unlike certain generals   late boer war  no believer  frontal attacks  if we do not wish  fight we can prevent  enemy  engaging us even though  lines  our encampment  merely traced out   ground all we need do   throw something odd  unaccountable  his way this extremely concise expression  intelligibly paraphrased  chia lin even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch li ch’uan says we puzzle him  strange  unusual dispositions  tu mu finally clinches  meaning  three illustrative anecdotes—one  chuko liang who when occupying yangp’ing  about   attacked  ssuma i suddenly struck his colors stopped  beating   drums  flung open  city gates showing only  few men engaged  sweeping  sprinkling  ground this unexpected proceeding had  intended effect  ssuma i suspecting  ambush actually drew off his army  retreated what sun tzŭ  advocating here therefore  nothing more nor less than  timely use  bluff  by discovering  enemy’s dispositions  remaining invisible ourselves we can keep our forces concentrated while  enemy’s must  divided the conclusion  perhaps not very obvious but chang yu after mei yaoch’en rightly explains  thus if  enemy’s dispositions  visible we can make  him  one body whereas our own dispositions being kept secret  enemy   obliged  divide his forces  order  guard against attack  every quarter  we can form  single united body while  enemy must split up into fractions hence there    whole pitted against separate parts   whole which means  we shall  many   enemy’s few  and if we  able thus  attack

consequence a mistaken feeling  pity  often induce  general  relieve  beleaguered city or  reinforce  hardpressed detachment contrary  his military instincts it  now generally admitted  our repeated

all days  rising wind  in attacking  fire one should  prepared  meet five possible developments   when fire breaks out inside  enemy’s camp respond  once   attack  without   if there   outbreak  fire but  enemy’s soldiers remain quiet bide your time  do not attack the prime object  attacking  fire   throw  enemy into confusion if this effect  not produced  means   enemy  ready  receive us hence  necessity  caution   when  force   flames  reached  height follow  up   attack if   practicable if not stay where you are ts’ao kung says if you see  possible way advance but if you find  difficulties too great retire   if   possible  make  assault  fire  without do not wait    break out within but deliver your attack   favourable moment tu mu says   previous paragraphs had reference   fire breaking out either accidentally we may suppose or   agency  incendiaries inside  enemy’s camp but  continues if  enemy  settled   waste place littered  quantities  grass or if   pitched his camp   position which can  burnt out we must carry our fire against him  any seasonable opportunity  not await   hopes   outbreak occurring within  fear our opponents should themselves burn up  surrounding vegetation  thus render our own attempts fruitless the famous li ling once baffled  leader   hsiungnu  this way the latter taking advantage   favourable wind tried  set fire   chinese general’s camp but found  every scrap  combustible vegetation   neighbourhood had already been burnt down on  other hand pots’ai  general   yellow turban rebels  badly defeated   ad through his neglect  this simple precaution at  head   large army   besieging ch’angshe which  held  huangfu sung the garrison  very small   general feeling  nervousness pervaded  ranks so huangfu sung called his officers together  said in war there  various indirect methods  attack  numbers do not count  everything the commentator here quotes sun tzŭ v §§     now  rebels have pitched their camp   midst  thick grass which  easily burn when  wind blows if we set fire    night they   thrown into  panic  we can make  sortie  attack them  all sides  once thus emulating  achievement  t’ien tan’ see p  that same evening  strong breeze sprang up so huangfu sung instructed his soldiers  bind reeds together into torches  mount guard   city walls after which  sent out  band  daring men who stealthily made their way through  lines  started  fire  loud shouts  yells simultaneously  glare  light shot up   city walls  huangfu sung sounding his drums led  rapid charge which threw  rebels into confusion  put them  headlong flight hou han shu ch         when you start  fire   windward  it do not attack   leeward chang yu following tu yu says when you make  fire  enemy  retreat away  it if you oppose his retreat  attack him then   fight desperately which  not conduce  your success a rather more obvious explanation  given  tu mu if  wind    east begin burning   east   enemy  follow up  attack yourself   side if you start  fire   east side  then attack   west you  suffer   same way  your enemy  a wind  rises   daytime lasts long but  night breeze soon falls cf lao tzŭ’s saying a violent wind does not last  space   morning tao te ching chap  mei yaoch’en  wang hsi say a day breeze dies down  nightfall   night breeze  daybreak this  what happens   general rule the phenomenon observed may  correct enough but how this sense    obtained  not apparent  in every army  five developments connected  fire must  known  movements   stars calculated   watch kept   proper days tu mu says we must make calculations    paths   stars  watch   days  which wind  rise before making our attack  fire chang yu seems  interpret  text differently we must not only know how  assail our opponents  fire but also   our guard against similar attacks  them  hence those who use fire   aid   attack show intelligence those who use water   aid   attack gain  accession  strength  by means  water  enemy may  intercepted but not robbed  all his belongings ts’ao kung’s note is we can merely obstruct  enemy’s road or divide his army but not sweep away all his accumulated stores water can do useful service but  lacks  terrible destructive power  fire this   reason chang yu concludes why  former  dismissed   couple  sentences whereas  attack  fire  discussed  detail wu tzŭ ch  speaks thus   two elements if  army  encamped  lowlying marshy ground  which  water cannot run off  where  rainfall  heavy  may  submerged   flood if  army  encamped  wild marsh lands thickly overgrown  weeds  brambles  visited  frequent gales  may  exterminated  fire  unhappy   fate  one who tries  win his battles  succeed  his attacks without cultivating  spirit  enterprise   result  waste  time  general stagnation this  one   most perplexing passages  sun tzŭ ts’ao kung says rewards  good service should not  deferred  single day and tu mu if you do not take opportunity  advance  reward  deserving your subordinates  not carry out your commands  disaster  ensue for several reasons however   spite   formidable array  scholars   other side i prefer  interpretation suggested  mei yaoch’en alone whose words i  quote those who want  make sure  succeeding  their battles  assaults must seize  favourable moments when they come  not shrink  occasion  heroic measures    say they must resort  such means  attack  fire water   like what they must not do  what  prove fatal   sit still  simply hold   advantages they have got  hence  saying the enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead  good general cultivates his resources tu mu quotes  following   san lueh ch  the warlike prince controls his soldiers  his authority kits them together  good faith   rewards makes them serviceable if faith decays there   disruption if rewards  deficient commands  not  respected  move not unless you see  advantage use not your troops unless there  something   gained fight not unless  position  critical sun tzŭ may  times appear   overcautious but  never goes so far   direction   remarkable passage   tao te ching ch  i dare not take  initiative but prefer  act   defensive i dare not advance  inch but prefer  retreat  foot  no ruler should put troops into  field merely  gratify his own spleen no general should fight  battle simply out  pique  if    your advantage make  forward move if not stay where you are this  repeated  xi §  here i feel convinced     interpolation    evident  §  ought  follow immediately  §   anger may  time change  gladness vexation may  succeeded  content  but  kingdom   once been destroyed can never come again into being the wu state  destined    melancholy example  this saying nor can  dead ever  brought back  life  hence  enlightened ruler  heedful   good general full  caution this   way  keep  country  peace   army intact  unless you enter  tiger’s lair you cannot get hold   tiger’s cubs chapter xiii the use of spies  sun tzŭ said raising  host   hundred thousand men  marching them great distances entails heavy loss   people   drain   resources   state the daily expenditure  amount   thousand ounces  silver cf ii §§    there   commotion  home  abroad  men  drop down exhausted   highways cf tao te ching ch  where troops have been quartered brambles  thorns spring up chang yu   note we may  reminded   saying ‘on serious ground gather  plunder’ why then should carriage  transportation cause exhaustion   highways—the answer is  not victuals alone but all sorts  munitions  war have   conveyed   army besides  injunction  ‘forage   enemy’ only means  when  army  deeply engaged  hostile territory scarcity  food must  provided against hence without being solely dependent   enemy  corn we must forage  order  there may   uninterrupted flow  supplies then again there  places like salt deserts where provisions being unobtainable supplies  home cannot  dispensed with as many  seven hundred thousand families   impeded  their labor mei yaoch’en says men   lacking   ploughtail the allusion    system  dividing land into nine parts each consisting  about  acres  plot   center being cultivated  behalf   state   tenants   other eight it  here also so tu mu tells us  their cottages  built   well sunk   used  all  common see ii §  note in time  war one   families had  serve   army while  other seven contributed   support thus   levy   men reckoning one ablebodied soldier  each family  husbandry   families would  affected  hostile armies may face each other  years striving   victory which  decided   single day this being so  remain  ignorance   enemy’s condition simply because one grudges  outlay   hundred ounces  silver  honours  emoluments for spies   course  meaning though  would spoil  effect  this curiously elaborate exordium if spies  actually mentioned  this point   height  inhumanity sun tzŭ’s agreement  certainly ingenious he begins  adverting   frightful misery  vast expenditure  blood  treasure which war always brings   train now unless you  kept informed   enemy’s condition   ready  strike   right moment  war may drag   years the only way  get this information   employ spies    impossible  obtain trustworthy spies unless they  properly paid  their services but   surely false economy  grudge  comparatively trifling amount  this purpose when every day   war lasts eats up  incalculably greater sum this grievous burden falls   shoulders   poor  hence sun tzŭ concludes   neglect  use  spies  nothing less than  crime against humanity  one who acts thus  no leader  men no present help  his sovereign no master  victory this idea   true object  war  peace   root   national temperament   chinese even so far back   bc these memorable words  uttered  prince chuang   ch’u state the chinese character  ‘prowess’  made up  the characters for ‘to stay’  ‘a spear’ cessation  hostilities military prowess  seen   repression  cruelty  calling   weapons  preservation   appointment  heaven  firm establishment  merit  bestowal  happiness   people putting harmony between  princes  diffusion  wealth  thus what enables  wise sovereign   good general  strike  conquer  achieve things beyond  reach  ordinary men  foreknowledge that is knowledge   enemy’s dispositions  what  means  do  now this foreknowledge cannot  elicited  spirits  cannot  obtained inductively  experience tu mu’s note is knowledge   enemy cannot  gained  reasoning  other analogous cases nor  any deductive calculation li ch’uan says quantities like length breadth distance  magnitude  susceptible  exact mathematical determination human actions cannot  so calculated  knowledge   enemy’s dispositions can only  obtained  other men mei yaoch’en  rather  interesting note knowledge   spiritworld    obtained  divination information  natural science may  sought  inductive reasoning  laws   universe can  verified  mathematical calculation but  dispositions   enemy  ascertainable through spies  spies alone  hence  use  spies  whom there  five classes  local spies  inward spies  converted spies  doomed spies  surviving spies  when these five kinds  spy  all  work none can discover  secret system this  called divine manipulation   threads it

through scouts  spies etc  much  his success  war  traceable   previous knowledge   enemy’s moves thus gained    having local spies means employing  services   inhabitants   district tu mu says in  enemy’s country win people over  kind treatment  use them  spies  having inward spies making use  officials   enemy tu mu enumerates  following classes  likely  do good service  this respect worthy men who have been degraded  office criminals who have undergone punishment also favourite concubines who  greedy  gold men who  aggrieved  being  subordinate positions or who have been passed over

these several kinds  continues should  secretly approached  bound  one’s interests  means  rich presents in this way you   able  find out  state  affairs   enemy’s country ascertain  plans   being formed against you  moreover disturb  harmony  create  breach between  sovereign  his ministers the necessity  extreme caution however  dealing  inward spies appears   historical incident related  ho

this   alternative definition but    not what sun tzŭ meant  conclusively proved  his subsequent remarks about treating  converted spy generously §  sqq ho shih notes three occasions  which converted

into  trap  which his army  divided into two  his communications cut  after  desperate resistance lasting  days during which  famished soldiers devoured one another   himself killed   arrow  his whole force amounting   said   men ruthlessly put   sword  having doomed spies doing certain things openly  purposes  deception  allowing our own spies  know  them  report them   enemy tu yu gives  best exposition   meaning we ostentatiously do things calculated  deceive our own spies who must  led  believe  they have been unwittingly disclosed then when these spies  captured   enemy’s lines they  make  entirely false report   enemy  take measures accordingly only  find  we do something quite different the spies  thereupon  put  death as  example  doomed spies ho shih mentions  prisoners released  pan ch’ao  his campaign against yarkand see p  he also refers  t’ang chien who   ad  sent  t’ai tsung  lull  turkish kahn chiehli into fancied security until li ching  able  deliver

robust endowed  physical strength  courage thoroughly accustomed  all sorts  dirty work able  endure hunger  cold   put up  shame  ignominy ho shih tells  following story  ta’hsi wu   sui dynasty when   governor  eastern ch’in shenwu  ch’i made  hostile movement upon shayuan the emperor t’ai tsu  kao tsu sent tahsi wu  spy upon  enemy he  accompanied  two other men all three   horseback  wore

thus they managed  return   fullest possible information about  enemy’s dispositions  received warm commendation   emperor who  consequence  their report  able  inflict  severe defeat  his adversary  hence     none   whole army  more intimate relations   maintained than  spies tu mu  mei yaoch’en point out   spy  privileged  enter even  general’s private sleepingtent none should  more liberally rewarded in no other business should greater secrecy  preserved tu mu gives  graphic touch all communication  spies should  carried mouthtoear the following remarks  spies may  quoted  turenne who made perhaps larger use  them than any previous commander spies  attached  those who give them most  who pays them ill  never served they should never  known  anybody nor should they know one another when they propose anything very material secure their persons or have  your possession their wives  children  hostages  their fidelity never communicate anything  them but what  absolutely necessary  they should know    spies cannot  usefully employed without  certain intuitive sagacity mei yaoch’en says in order  use them one must know fact  falsehood   able  discriminate between honesty  doubledealing wang hsi   different interpretation thinks more along  lines  intuitive perception  practical intelligence tu mu strangely refers these attributes   spies themselves before using spies we must assure ourselves   their integrity  character   extent  their experience  skill but  continues a brazen face   crafty disposition  more dangerous than mountains or rivers  takes  man  genius  penetrate such so  we  left  some doubt   his real opinion   passage  they cannot  properly managed without benevolence  straightforwardness chang yu says when you have attracted them  substantial offers you must treat them  absolute sincerity then they  work  you  all their might  without subtle ingenuity  mind one cannot make certain   truth  their reports mei yaoch’en says be  your guard against  possibility  spies going over   service   enemy  be subtle  subtle  use your spies  every kind  business cf vi §   if  secret piece  news  divulged   spy before  time  ripe  must  put  death together   man  whom  secret  told word  word  translation here is if spy matters  heard before our plans  carried out etc sun tzŭ’s main point  this passage is whereas you kill  spy himself as  punishment  letting out  secret  object  killing  other man  only  ch’en hao puts it to stop his mouth  prevent news leaking any further if  had already been repeated  others this object would not  gained either way sun tzŭ lays himself open   charge  inhumanity though tu mu tries  defend him  saying   man deserves   put  death   spy would certainly not have told  secret unless  other had been  pains  worm  out  him  whether  object   crush  army  storm  city or  assassinate  individual   always necessary  begin  finding out  names   attendants  aidesde camp literally visitors  equivalent  tu yu says  those whose duty    keep  general supplied  information which naturally necessitates frequent interviews  him  doorkeepers  sentries   general  command our spies must  commissioned  ascertain these as  first step no doubt towards finding out if any  these important functionaries can  won over  bribery  the enemy’s spies who have come  spy  us must  sought out tempted  bribes led away  comfortably housed thus they  become converted spies  available  our service  it  through  information brought   converted spy  we  able  acquire  employ local  inward spies tu yu says through conversion   enemy’s spies we learn  enemy’s condition and chang yu says we must tempt  converted spy into our service because     knows which   local inhabitants  greedy  gain  which   officials  open  corruption  it  owing  his information again  we can cause  doomed spy  carry false tidings   enemy chang yu says because  converted spy knows how  enemy can best  deceived  lastly    his information   surviving spy can  used  appointed occasions  the end  aim  spying  all  five varieties  knowledge   enemy  this knowledge can only  derived   first instance   converted spy as explained  §§  he not only brings information himself but makes  possible  use  other kinds  spy  advantage hence   essential   converted spy  treated   utmost liberality  of old  rise   yin dynasty sun tzŭ
