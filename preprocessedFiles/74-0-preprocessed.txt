but still loud enough   furniture  hear “well i lay if i get hold  you i’ll—” she did not finish   this time she  bending down  punching under  bed   broom  so she needed breath  punctuate  punches with she resurrected nothing but  cat “i never did see  beat   boy” she went   open door  stood    looked out among  tomato vines  “jimpson” weeds  constituted  garden no tom so she lifted up her

didn’t let  jam alone i’d skin you hand me  switch” the switch hovered   air—the peril  desperate— “my look behind you aunt” the old lady whirled round  snatched her skirts out  danger the lad fled   instant scrambled up  high boardfence  disappeared over it his aunt polly stood surprised  moment  then broke into  gentle laugh “hang  boy can’t i never learn anything ain’t  played me tricks enough like   me   looking out  him  this time but old fools   biggest fools there is can’t learn  old dog new tricks   saying is but my goodness  never plays them alike two days  how   body  know what’s

when all  boys  having holiday but  hates work more than  hates anything else  i’ve got  do some  my duty  him or i’ll   ruination   child” tom did play hookey   had  very good time he got back home barely  season  help jim  small colored boy saw nextday’s wood  split  kindlings before supper—at least   there  time  tell his adventures  jim while jim did threefourths   work tom’s younger brother or rather halfbrother sid  already through  his part   work picking up chips     quiet boy  had no adventurous troublesome ways while tom  eating his supper  stealing sugar  opportunity offered aunt polly asked him questions   full  guile  very deep—for she wanted  trap him into damaging revealments like many other simplehearted souls   her pet vanity  believe she  endowed   talent  dark  mysterious diplomacy  she loved  contemplate her most transparent devices  marvels  low cunning said she “tom   middling warm  school warn’t it” “yes’m” “powerful warm warn’t it” “yes’m” “didn’t you want  go  aswimming tom” a bit   scare shot through tom—a touch  uncomfortable suspicion he searched aunt polly’s face but  told him nothing so  said “no’m—well not very much” the old lady reached out her hand  felt tom’s shirt  said “but you ain’t too warm now though” and  flattered her  reflect  she had discovered   shirt  dry without anybody knowing    what she had  her mind but  spite  her tom knew where  wind lay now so  forestalled what might   next move “some  us pumped  our heads—mine’s damp yet see” aunt polly  vexed  think she had overlooked  bit  circumstantial evidence  missed  trick then she had  new inspiration “tom you didn’t have  undo your shirt collar where i sewed it  pump  your head did you unbutton your jacket” the trouble vanished out  tom’s face he opened his jacket his shirt collar  securely sewed “bother well go ’long  you i’d made sure you’d played hookey  been aswimming but i forgive ye tom i reckon you’re  kind   singed cat   saying is—better’n you look this time” she  half sorry her sagacity had miscarried  half glad  tom had stumbled into obedient conduct  once but sidney said “well now if i didn’t think you sewed his collar  white thread but it’s black” “why i did sew   white tom” but tom did not wait   rest as  went out   door  said “siddy i’ll lick you  that” in  safe place tom examined two large needles which  thrust into  lapels  his jacket  had thread bound about them—one needle carried white thread   other black he said “she’d never noticed if  hadn’t been  sid confound it sometimes she sews   white  sometimes she sews   black i wish  geeminy she’d stick  one or t’other—i can’t keep  run  ’em but i bet you i’ll lam sid  that i’ll learn him” he  not  model boy   village he knew  model boy very well though—and loathed him within two minutes or even less  had forgotten all his troubles not because his troubles  one whit less heavy  bitter  him than  man’s    man but because  new  powerful interest bore them down  drove them out  his mind   time—just  men’s misfortunes  forgotten   excitement  new enterprises this new interest   valued novelty  whistling which  had just acquired   negro    suffering  practise  undisturbed it consisted   peculiar birdlike turn  sort  liquid warble produced  touching  tongue   roof   mouth  short intervals   midst   music—the reader probably remembers how  do it if   ever been  boy diligence  attention soon gave him  knack  it   strode down  street  his mouth full  harmony  his soul full  gratitude he felt much   astronomer feels who  discovered  new planet—no doubt  far  strong deep unalloyed pleasure  concerned  advantage    boy not  astronomer the summer evenings  long it  not dark yet presently tom checked his whistle a stranger  before him—a boy  shade larger than himself a newcomer  any age or either sex   impressive curiosity   poor little shabby village  st petersburg this boy  well dressed too—well dressed   weekday this  simply astounding his cap   dainty thing his closebuttoned blue cloth roundabout  new  natty  so  his pantaloons he had shoes on—and   only friday he even wore  necktie  bright bit  ribbon he had  citified air about him  ate into tom’s vitals the more tom stared   splendid marvel  higher  turned up his nose  his finery   shabbier  shabbier his own outfit seemed  him  grow neither boy spoke if one moved  other moved—but only sidewise   circle they kept face  face  eye  eye all  time finally tom said “i can lick you” “i’d like  see you try it” “well i can do it” “no you can’t either” “yes i can” “no you can’t” “i can” “you can’t” “can” “can’t” an uncomfortable pause then tom said “what’s your name” “’tisn’t any  your business maybe” “well i ’low i’ll make  my business” “well why don’t you” “if you say much i will” “much—much—much there now” “oh you think you’re mighty smart don’t you i could lick you  one hand tied behind me if i wanted to” “well why don’t you do it you say you can do it” “well i will if you fool  me” “oh yes—i’ve seen whole families   same fix” “smarty you think you’re some now don’t you oh what  hat” “you can lump  hat if you don’t like it i dare you  knock  off—and anybody that’ll take  dare  suck eggs” “you’re  liar” “you’re another” “you’re  fighting liar  dasn’t take  up” “aw—take  walk” “say—if you give me much more  your sass i’ll take  bounce  rock off’n your head” “oh  course you will” “well i will” “well why don’t you do  then what do you keep saying you  for why don’t you do it it’s because you’re afraid” “i ain’t afraid” “you are” “i ain’t” “you are” another pause  more eying  sidling around each other presently they  shoulder  shoulder tom said “get away  here” “go away yourself” “i won’t” “i won’t either” so they stood each   foot placed   angle   brace  both shoving  might  main  glowering  each other  hate but neither could get  advantage after struggling till both  hot  flushed each relaxed his strain  watchful caution  tom said “you’re  coward   pup i’ll tell my big brother  you   can thrash you  his little finger  i’ll make him do it too” “what do i care  your big brother i’ve got  brother that’s bigger than  is—and what’s more  can throw him over  fence too” both brothers  imaginary “that’s  lie” “your saying so don’t make  so” tom drew  line   dust  his big toe  said “i dare you  step over that  i’ll lick you till you can’t stand up anybody that’ll take  dare  steal sheep” the new boy stepped over promptly  said “now you said you’d do it now let’s see you do it” “don’t you crowd me now you better look out” “well you said you’d do it—why don’t you do it” “by jingo  two cents i will do it” the new boy took two broad coppers out  his pocket  held them out  derision tom struck them   ground in  instant both boys  rolling  tumbling   dirt gripped together like cats    space   minute they tugged  tore  each other’s hair  clothes punched  scratched each other’s nose  covered themselves  dust  glory presently  confusion took form  through  fog  battle tom appeared seated astride  new boy  pounding him  his fists “holler ’nuff” said he the boy only struggled  free himself he  crying—mainly  rage “holler ’nuff”—and  pounding went on at last  stranger got out  smothered “’nuff”  tom let him up  said “now that’ll learn you better look out who you’re fooling  next time” the new boy went off brushing  dust  his clothes sobbing snuffling  occasionally looking back  shaking his head  threatening what  would do  tom  “next time  caught him out” to which tom responded  jeers  started off  high feather   soon  his back  turned  new boy snatched up  stone threw   hit him between  shoulders  then turned tail  ran like  antelope tom chased  traitor home  thus found out where  lived he then held  position   gate  some time daring  enemy  come outside but  enemy only made faces  him through  window  declined at last  enemy’s mother appeared  called tom  bad vicious vulgar child  ordered him away so  went away but  said  “’lowed”  “lay”   boy he got home pretty late  night  when  climbed cautiously    window  uncovered  ambuscade   person  his aunt  when she saw  state his clothes   her resolution  turn his saturday

spirit thirty yards  board fence nine feet high life  him seemed hollow  existence but  burden sighing  dipped his brush  passed  along  topmost plank repeated  operation did  again compared  insignificant whitewashed streak   farreaching continent  unwhitewashed fence  sat down   treebox discouraged jim came skipping out   gate   tin pail  singing buffalo gals bringing water   town pump had always been hateful work  tom’s eyes before but now  did not strike him so he remembered  there  company   pump white mulatto  negro boys  girls  always there waiting their turns resting trading playthings quarrelling fighting skylarking and  remembered  although  pump  only  hundred  fifty yards off jim never got back   bucket  water under  hour—and even then somebody generally had  go after him tom said “say jim i’ll fetch  water if you’ll whitewash some” jim shook his head  said “can’t mars tom ole missis she tole me i got  go an’ git dis water an’ not stop foolin’ roun’ wid anybody she

waver “white alley jim and it’s  bully taw” “my dat’s  mighty gay marvel i tell you but mars tom i’s powerful ’fraid ole missis—” “and besides if you  i’ll show you my sore toe” jim  only human—this attraction  too much  him he put down his pail took  white alley  bent over  toe  absorbing interest while  bandage  being unwound in another moment   flying down  street  his pail   tingling rear tom  whitewashing  vigor  aunt polly  retiring   field   slipper  her hand  triumph  her eye but tom’s energy did not last he began  think   fun  had planned  this day  his sorrows multiplied soon  free boys would come tripping along  all sorts  delicious expeditions  they would make  world  fun  him  having  work—the very thought   burnt him like fire he got out his worldly wealth  examined it—bits  toys marbles  trash enough  buy  exchange  work maybe but not half enough  buy so much  half  hour  pure freedom so  returned his straitened means  his pocket  gave up  idea  trying  buy  boys at this dark  hopeless moment  inspiration burst upon him nothing less than  great magnificent inspiration he took up his brush  went tranquilly  work ben rogers hove  sight presently—the very boy  all boys whose ridicule  had been dreading ben’s gait   hopskipandjump—proof enough  his heart  light  his anticipations high he  eating  apple  giving  long melodious whoop  intervals followed   deeptoned

personating  big missouri  considered himself   drawing nine feet  water he  boat  captain  enginebells combined so  had  imagine himself standing  his own hurricanedeck giving  orders  executing them “stop her sir tingalingling” the headway ran almost out   drew up slowly toward  sidewalk “ship up  back tingalingling” his arms straightened  stiffened down his sides “set her back   stabboard tingalingling chow chchowwow chow” his right hand meantime describing stately circles—for   representing  fortyfoot wheel “let her go back   labboard tingalingling chowchchowchow” the left hand began  describe circles “stop  stabboard tingalingling stop  labboard come ahead   stabboard stop her let your outside turn over slow tingalingling chowowow get out  headline lively now come—out  your

attention   steamboat ben stared  moment  then said “hiyi you’re up  stump ain’t you” no answer tom surveyed his last touch   eye   artist then  gave his brush another gentle sweep  surveyed  result  before ben ranged up alongside  him tom’s mouth watered   apple but  stuck  his work ben said “hello old chap you got  work hey” tom wheeled suddenly  said “why it’s you ben i warn’t noticing” “say—i’m going  aswimming i am don’t you wish you could but  course you’d druther work—wouldn’t you course you would” tom contemplated  boy  bit  said “what do you call work” “why ain’t that work” tom resumed his whitewashing  answered carelessly “well maybe  is  maybe  ain’t all i know is  suits tom sawyer” “oh come now you don’t mean  let   you like it” the brush continued  move “like it well i don’t see why i oughtn’t  like it does  boy get  chance  whitewash  fence every day” that put  thing   new light ben stopped nibbling his apple tom swept his brush daintily back  forth—stepped back  note  effect—added  touch here  there—criticised  effect again—ben watching every move  getting more  more interested more  more absorbed presently  said “say tom let me whitewash  little” tom considered  about  consent but  altered his mind “no—no—i reckon  wouldn’t hardly do ben you see aunt polly’s awful particular about this fence—right here   street you know—but if    back fence i wouldn’t mind  she wouldn’t yes she’s awful particular about this fence it’s got   done very careful i reckon there ain’t one boy   thousand maybe two thousand  can do   way it’s got   done” “no—is  so oh come now—lemme just try only just  little—i’d let you if you  me tom” “ben i’d like to honest injun but aunt polly—well jim wanted  do it but she wouldn’t let him sid wanted  do it  she wouldn’t let sid now don’t you see how i’m fixed if you   tackle this fence  anything   happen  it—” “oh shucks i’ll  just  careful now lemme try say—i’ll give you  core  my apple” “well here—no ben now don’t i’m afeard—” “i’ll give you all  it” tom gave up  brush  reluctance  his face but alacrity  his heart and while  late steamer big missouri worked  sweated   sun  retired artist sat   barrel   shade close by dangled his legs munched his apple  planned  slaughter  more innocents there  no lack  material boys happened along every little while they came  jeer but remained  whitewash by  time ben  fagged out tom had traded  next chance  billy fisher   kite  good repair  when  played out johnny miller bought    dead rat   string  swing  with—and so on  so on hour after hour and when  middle   afternoon came  being  poor povertystricken boy   morning tom  literally rolling  wealth he had besides  things before mentioned twelve marbles part   jewsharp  piece  blue bottleglass  look through

would have bankrupted every boy   village tom said  himself    not such  hollow world after all he had discovered  great law  human action without knowing it—namely   order  make  man or  boy covet  thing   only necessary  make  thing difficult  attain if  had been  great  wise philosopher like  writer  this book  would now have comprehended  work consists  whatever  body  obliged  do   play consists  whatever  body  not obliged  do and this would help him  understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing   treadmill  work while rolling tenpins or climbing mont blanc  only amusement there  wealthy gentlemen  england who drive fourhorse passengercoaches twenty or thirty miles   daily line   summer because  privilege costs them considerable money but if they  offered wages   service  would turn  into work  then they would resign the boy mused awhile over  substantial change which had taken place  his worldly circumstances  then wended toward headquarters  report chapter iii tom presented himself before aunt polly who  sitting   open window   pleasant rearward apartment which  bedroom breakfastroom diningroom  library combined the balmy summer air  restful quiet  odor   flowers   drowsing murmur   bees had had their effect  she  nodding over her knitting—for she had no company but  cat    asleep  her lap her spectacles  propped up  her gray head  safety she had thought   course tom had deserted long ago  she wondered  seeing him place himself  her power again  this intrepid way he said “mayn’t i go  play now aunt” “what a’ready how much have you done” “it’s all done aunt” “tom don’t lie  me—i can’t bear it” “i ain’t aunt  is all done” aunt polly placed small trust  such evidence she went out  see  herself  she would have been content  find twenty per cent  tom’s statement true when she found  entire fence whitewashed  not only whitewashed but elaborately coated  recoated  even  streak added   ground her astonishment  almost unspeakable she said “well i never there’s no getting round it you can work when you’re  mind to tom” and then she diluted  compliment  adding “but it’s powerful seldom you’re  mind to i’m bound  say well go ’long  play but mind you get back some time   week or i’ll tan you” she  so overcome   splendor  his achievement  she took him into  closet  selected  choice apple  delivered   him along   improving lecture upon  added value  flavor  treat took  itself when  came without sin through virtuous effort and while she closed   happy scriptural flourish  “hooked”  doughnut then  skipped out  saw sid just starting up  outside stairway  led   back rooms   second floor clods  handy   air  full  them   twinkling they raged around sid like  hailstorm  before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties  sally   rescue six or seven clods had taken personal effect  tom  over  fence  gone there   gate but   general thing   too crowded  time  make use  it his soul   peace now   had settled  sid  calling attention  his black thread  getting him into trouble tom skirted  block  came round into  muddy alley  led   back  his aunt’s cowstable he presently got safely beyond  reach  capture  punishment  hastened toward  public square   village where two “military” companies  boys had met  conflict according  previous appointment tom  general  one  these armies joe harper a bosom friend general   other these two great commanders did not condescend  fight  person—that being better suited   still smaller fry—but sat together   eminence  conducted  field operations  orders delivered through aidesdecamp tom’s army won  great victory after  long  hardfought battle then  dead  counted prisoners exchanged  terms   next disagreement agreed upon   day   necessary battle appointed after which  armies fell into line  marched away  tom turned homeward alone as   passing   house where jeff thatcher lived  saw  new girl   garden—a lovely little blueeyed creature  yellow hair plaited into two longtails white summer frock  embroidered pantalettes the freshcrowned hero fell without firing  shot a certain amy lawrence vanished out  his heart  left not even  memory  herself behind he had thought  loved her  distraction  had regarded his passion  adoration  behold   only  poor little evanescent partiality he had been months winning her she had confessed hardly  week ago  had been  happiest   proudest boy   world only seven short days  here  one instant  time she had gone out  his heart like  casual stranger whose visit  done he worshipped this new angel  furtive eye till  saw  she had discovered him then  pretended  did not know she  present  began  “show off”  all sorts  absurd boyish ways  order  win her admiration he kept up this grotesque foolishness  some time but byandby while     midst  some dangerous gymnastic performances  glanced aside  saw   little girl  wending her way toward  house tom came up   fence  leaned  it grieving  hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer she halted  moment   steps  then moved toward  door tom heaved  great sigh  she put her foot   threshold but his face lit up right away  she tossed  pansy over  fence  moment before she disappeared the boy ran around  stopped within  foot or two   flower  then shaded his eyes  his hand  began  look down street  if  had discovered something  interest going    direction presently  picked up  straw  began trying  balance   his nose  his head tilted far back    moved  side  side  his efforts  edged nearer  nearer toward  pansy finally his bare foot rested upon it his pliant toes closed upon it   hopped away   treasure  disappeared round  corner but only   minute—only while  could button  flower inside his jacket next his heart—or next his stomach possibly    not much posted

glorying over tom which  wellnigh unbearable but sid’s fingers slipped   bowl dropped  broke tom   ecstasies in such ecstasies   even controlled his tongue   silent he said  himself   would not speak

exultation   could hardly hold himself when  old lady came back  stood above  wreck discharging lightnings  wrath  over her spectacles he said  himself “now it’s coming” and  next instant   sprawling

tongue again she only said “umf well you didn’t get  lick amiss i reckon you been into some other audacious mischief when i wasn’t around like enough” then her conscience reproached her  she yearned  say something kind  loving but she judged  this would  construed into  confession  she had been   wrong  discipline forbade that so she kept silence  went about her affairs   troubled heart tom sulked

upon him now  then through  film  tears but  refused recognition  it he pictured himself lying sick unto death  his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word but  would turn his face   wall  die   word unsaid ah how would she feel then and  pictured himself brought home   river dead  his curls all wet  his sore heart  rest how she would throw herself upon him  how her tears would fall like rain  her lips pray god  give her back her boy  she would never never abuse him any more but  would lie there cold  white  make no sign—a poor little sufferer whose griefs    end he so worked upon his feelings   pathos  these dreams   had  keep swallowing   so like  choke  his eyes swam   blur  water which overflowed when  winked  ran down  trickled   end  his nose and such  luxury

“i forgive everybody sid groan tell ’em so sid and sid you give my windowsash  my cat  one eye   new girl that’s come  town  tell her—” but sid had snatched his clothes  gone tom  suffering  reality now so handsomely  his imagination working  so his groans had gathered quite  genuine tone sid flew downstairs  said “oh aunt polly come tom’s dying” “dying” “yes’m don’t wait—come quick” “rubbage i don’t believe it” but she fled upstairs nevertheless  sid  mary  her heels and her face grew white too  her lip trembled when she reached  bedside she gasped out “you tom tom what’s  matter  you” “oh auntie i’m—” “what’s  matter  you—what   matter  you child” “oh auntie my sore toe’s mortified” the old lady sank down into  chair  laughed  little then cried  little then did both together this restored her  she said “tom what  turn you did give me now you shut up  nonsense  climb out  this” the groans ceased   pain vanished   toe the boy felt  little foolish   said “aunt polly  seemed mortified   hurt so i never minded my tooth  all” “your tooth indeed what’s  matter  your tooth” “one  them’s loose   aches perfectly awful” “there there now don’t begin  groaning again open your mouth well—your tooth is loose but you’re not going  die about that mary get me  silk thread   chunk  fire out   kitchen” tom said “oh please auntie don’t pull  out it don’t hurt any more i wish i may never stir if  does please don’t auntie i don’t want  stay home  school” “oh you don’t don’t you so all this row  because you thought you’d get  stay home  school  go afishing tom tom i love you so  you seem  try every way you can  break my old heart  your outrageousness” by this time  dental instruments  ready the old lady made one end   silk thread fast  tom’s tooth   loop  tied  other   bedpost then she seized  chunk  fire  suddenly thrust  almost into  boy’s face the tooth hung dangling   bedpost now but all trials bring their compensations as tom wended  school after breakfast    envy  every boy  met because  gap  his upper row  teeth enabled him  expectorate   new  admirable way he gathered quite  following  lads interested   exhibition  one  had cut his finger  had been  centre  fascination  homage up  this time now found himself suddenly without  adherent  shorn  his glory his heart  heavy   said   disdain which  did not feel   wasn’t anything  spit like tom sawyer but another boy said “sour grapes”   wandered away  dismantled hero shortly tom came upon  juvenile pariah   village huckleberry finn son   town drunkard huckleberry  cordially hated  dreaded  all  mothers   town because   idle  lawless  vulgar  bad—and because all their children admired him so  delighted  his forbidden society  wished they dared   like him tom  like  rest   respectable boys    envied huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition   under strict orders not  play  him so  played  him every time  got  chance huckleberry  always dressed   castoff clothes  fullgrown men  they   perennial bloom  fluttering  rags his hat   vast ruin   wide crescent lopped out   brim his coat when  wore one hung nearly  his heels  had  rearward buttons far down  back but one suspender supported his trousers  seat   trousers bagged low  contained nothing  fringed legs dragged   dirt when not rolled up huckleberry came  went  his own free will he slept  doorsteps  fine weather   empty hogsheads  wet  did not have  go  school or  church or call any being master or obey anybody  could go fishing or swimming when  where  chose  stay  long   suited him nobody forbade him  fight  could sit up  late   pleased   always  first boy  went barefoot   spring   last  resume leather   fall  never had  wash nor put  clean clothes  could swear wonderfully in  word everything  goes  make life precious  boy had so thought every harassed hampered respectable boy  st petersburg tom hailed  romantic outcast “hello huckleberry” “hello yourself  see how you like it” “what’s  you got” “dead cat” “lemme see him huck my he’s pretty stiff where’d you get him” “bought him off’n  boy” “what did you give” “i give  blue ticket   bladder  i got   slaughterhouse” “where’d you get  blue ticket” “bought

why don’t you becuz you know mighty well you can’t this   pretty early tick i reckon it’s  first one i’ve seen this year” “say huck—i’ll give you my tooth  him” “less see it” tom got out  bit  paper  carefully unrolled it huckleberry viewed  wistfully the temptation  very strong at last  said “is  genuwyne” tom lifted his lip  showed  vacancy “well all right” said huckleberry “it’s  trade” tom enclosed  tick   percussioncap box  had lately been  pinchbug’s prison   boys separated each feeling wealthier than before when tom reached  little isolated frame schoolhouse  strode  briskly   manner  one who had come  all honest speed he hung his hat   peg  flung himself into his seat  businesslike alacrity the master throned  high  his great splintbottom armchair  dozing lulled   drowsy hum  study the interruption roused him “thomas sawyer” tom knew  when his name  pronounced  full  meant trouble “sir” “come up here now sir why  you late again  usual” tom  about  take refuge   lie when  saw two long tails  yellow hair hanging down  back   recognized   electric sympathy  love    form  the only vacant place   girls’ side   schoolhouse he instantly said “i stopped  talk  huckleberry finn” the master’s pulse stood still   stared helplessly the buzz  study ceased the pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind the master said “you—you did what” “stopped  talk  huckleberry finn” there  no mistaking  words “thomas sawyer this   most astounding confession i have ever listened to no mere ferule  answer  this offence take off your jacket” the master’s arm performed until   tired   stock  switches notably diminished then  order followed “now sir go  sit   girls and let this   warning  you” the titter  rippled around  room appeared  abash  boy but  reality  result  caused rather more  his worshipful awe  his unknown idol   dread pleasure  lay  his high good fortune he sat down upon  end   pine bench   girl hitched herself away  him   toss  her head nudges  winks  whispers traversed  room but tom sat still  his arms upon  long low desk before him  seemed  study his book by   attention ceased  him   accustomed school murmur rose upon  dull air once more presently  boy began  steal furtive glances   girl she observed it “made  mouth”  him  gave him  back  her head   space   minute when she cautiously faced around again  peach lay before her she thrust  away tom gently put  back she thrust  away again but  less animosity tom patiently returned    place then she let  remain tom scrawled  his slate “please take it—i got more” the girl glanced   words but made no sign now  boy began  draw something   slate hiding his work  his left hand for  time  girl refused  notice but her human curiosity presently began  manifest itself  hardly perceptible signs the boy worked on apparently unconscious the girl made  sort  noncommittal attempt  see but  boy did not betray    aware  it at last she gave   hesitatingly whispered “let me see it” tom partly uncovered  dismal caricature   house  two gable ends     corkscrew  smoke issuing   chimney then  girl’s interest began  fasten itself upon  work  she forgot everything else when   finished she gazed  moment then whispered “it’s nice—make  man” the artist erected  man   front yard  resembled  derrick he could have stepped over  house but  girl  not hypercritical she  satisfied   monster  whispered “it’s  beautiful man—now make me coming along” tom drew  hourglass   full moon  straw limbs    armed  spreading fingers   portentous fan the girl said “it’s ever so nice—i wish i could draw” “it’s easy” whispered tom “i’ll learn you” “oh  you when” “at noon do you go home  dinner” “i’ll stay if you will” “good—that’s  whack what’s your name” “becky thatcher what’s yours oh i know it’s thomas sawyer” “that’s  name they lick me by i’m tom when i’m good you call me tom  you” “yes” now tom began  scrawl something   slate hiding  words   girl but she  not backward this time she begged  see tom said “oh  ain’t anything” “yes  is” “no  ain’t you don’t want  see” “yes i do indeed i do please let me” “you’ll tell” “no i won’t—deed  deed  double deed won’t” “you won’t tell anybody  all ever  long  you live” “no i won’t ever tell anybody now let me” “oh you don’t want  see” “now  you treat me so i will see” and she put her small hand upon his   little scuffle ensued tom pretending  resist  earnest but letting his hand slip  degrees till these words  revealed “i love you” “oh you bad thing” and she hit his hand  smart rap but reddened  looked pleased nevertheless just  this juncture  boy felt  slow fateful grip closing  his ear   steady lifting impulse in  wise   borne across  house  deposited  his own seat under  peppering fire  giggles   whole school then  master stood over him during  few awful moments  finally moved away  his throne without saying  word but although tom’s ear tingled his heart  jubilant as  school quieted down tom made  honest effort  study but  turmoil within him  too great in turn  took his place   reading class  made  botch  it then   geography class  turned lakes into mountains mountains into rivers  rivers into continents till chaos  come again then   spelling class  got “turned down”   succession  mere baby words till  brought up   foot  yielded up  pewter medal which  had worn  ostentation  months chapter vii the harder tom tried  fasten his mind  his book  more his ideas wandered so  last   sigh   yawn  gave  up it seemed  him   noon recess would never come the air  utterly dead there  not  breath stirring it   sleepiest  sleepy days the drowsing murmur   five  twenty studying scholars soothed  soul like  spell     murmur  bees away off   flaming sunshine cardiff hill lifted  soft green sides through  shimmering veil  heat tinted   purple  distance  few birds floated  lazy wing high   air no other living thing  visible but some cows  they  asleep tom’s heart ached   free or else  have something  interest  do  pass  dreary time his hand wandered into his pocket  his face lit up   glow  gratitude   prayer though  did not know it then furtively  percussioncap box came out he released  tick  put him   long flat desk the creature probably glowed   gratitude  amounted  prayer too  this moment but   premature  when  started thankfully  travel off tom turned him aside   pin  made him take  new direction tom’s bosom friend sat next him suffering just  tom had been  now   deeply  gratefully interested  this entertainment   instant this bosom friend  joe harper the two boys  sworn friends all  week  embattled enemies  saturdays joe took  pin out  his lapel  began  assist  exercising  prisoner the sport grew  interest momently soon tom said  they  interfering  each other  neither getting  fullest benefit   tick so  put joe’s slate   desk  drew  line down  middle    top  bottom “now” said he “as long     your side you can stir him up  i’ll let him alone but if you let him get away  get  my side you’re  leave him alone  long  i can keep him  crossing over” “all right go ahead start him up” the tick escaped  tom presently  crossed  equator joe harassed him awhile  then  got away  crossed back again this change  base occurred often while one boy  worrying  tick  absorbing interest  other would look   interest  strong  two heads bowed together over  slate   two souls dead  all things else at last luck seemed  settle  abide  joe the tick tried this that   other course  got  excited   anxious   boys themselves but time  again just   would have victory  his very grasp so  speak  tom’s fingers would  twitching  begin joe’s pin would deftly head him off  keep possession at last tom could stand  no longer the temptation  too strong so  reached out  lent  hand  his pin joe  angry   moment said he “tom you let him alone” “i only just want  stir him up  little joe” “no sir  ain’t fair you just let him alone” “blame it i ain’t going  stir him much” “let him alone i tell you” “i won’t” “you shall—he’s  my side   line” “look here joe harper whose   tick” “i don’t care whose tick  is—he’s  my side   line  you sha’n’t touch him” “well i’ll just bet i will though he’s my tick  i’ll do what i blame please  him or die” a tremendous whack came down  tom’s shoulders   duplicate  joe’s    space  two minutes  dust continued  fly   two jackets   whole school  enjoy it the boys had been too absorbed  notice  hush  had stolen upon  school awhile before when  master came tiptoeing down  room  stood over them he had contemplated  good part   performance before  contributed his bit  variety  it when school broke up  noon tom flew  becky thatcher  whispered  her ear “put  your bonnet  let  you’re going home  when you get   corner give  rest  ’em  slip  turn down through  lane  come back i’ll go  other way  come  over ’em  same way” so  one went off  one group  scholars   other  another in  little while  two met   bottom   lane  when they reached  school they had  all  themselves then they sat together   slate before them  tom gave becky  pencil  held her hand  his guiding it  so created another surprising house when  interest  art began  wane  two fell  talking tom  swimming  bliss he said “do you love rats” “no i hate them” “well i do too—live ones but i mean dead ones  swing round your head   string” “no i don’t care  rats much anyway what i like  chewinggum” “oh i should say so i wish i had some now” “do you i’ve got some i’ll let you chew  awhile but you must give  back  me” that  agreeable so they chewed  turn about  dangled their legs against  bench  excess  contentment “was you ever   circus” said tom “yes  my pa’s going  take me again some time if i’m good” “i been   circus three or four times—lots  times church ain’t shucks   circus there’s things going    circus all  time i’m going    clown   circus when i grow up” “oh  you that   nice they’re so lovely all spotted up” “yes that’s so and they get slathers  money—most  dollar  day ben rogers says say becky  you ever engaged” “what’s that” “why engaged   married” “no” “would you like to” “i reckon so i don’t know what   like” “like why  ain’t like anything you only just tell  boy you won’t ever have anybody but him ever ever ever  then you kiss  that’s all anybody can do it” “kiss what do you kiss for” “why that you know  to—well they always do that” “everybody” “why yes everybody that’s  love  each other do you remember what i wrote   slate” “ye—yes” “what  it” “i sha’n’t tell you” “shall i tell you” “ye—yes—but some other time” “no now” “no not now—tomorrow” “oh no now please becky—i’ll whisper it i’ll whisper  ever so easy” becky hesitating tom took silence  consent  passed his arm about her waist  whispered  tale ever so softly  his mouth close  her ear and then  added “now you whisper   me—just  same” she resisted   while  then said “you turn your face away so you can’t see  then i will but you mustn’t ever tell anybody—will you tom now you won’t will you” “no indeed indeed i won’t now becky” he turned his face away she bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls  whispered “i—love—you” then she sprang away  ran around  around  desks  benches  tom after her  took refuge   corner  last  her little white apron  her face tom clasped her about her neck  pleaded “now becky it’s all done—all over but  kiss don’t you  afraid  that—it ain’t anything  all please becky” and  tugged  her apron   hands by   she gave up  let her hands drop her face all glowing   struggle came up  submitted tom kissed  red lips  said “now it’s all done becky and always after this you know you ain’t ever  love anybody but me  you ain’t ever  marry anybody but me ever never  forever will you” “no i’ll never love anybody but you tom  i’ll never marry anybody but you—and you ain’t  ever marry anybody but me either” “certainly of course that’s part  it and always coming  school or when we’re going home you’re  walk  me when there ain’t anybody looking—and you choose me  i choose you  parties because that’s  way you do when you’re engaged” “it’s so nice i never heard   before” “oh it’s ever so gay why me  amy lawrence—” the big eyes told tom his blunder   stopped confused “oh tom then i ain’t  first you’ve ever been engaged to” the child began  cry tom said “oh don’t cry becky i don’t care  her any more” “yes you do tom—you know you do” tom tried  put his arm about her neck but she pushed him away  turned her face   wall  went  crying tom tried again  soothing words  his mouth   repulsed again then his pride  up   strode away  went outside he stood about restless  uneasy   while glancing   door every now  then hoping she would repent  come  find him but she did not then  began  feel badly  fear      wrong it   hard struggle  him  make new advances now but  nerved himself    entered she  still standing back there   corner sobbing  her face   wall tom’s heart smote him he went  her  stood  moment not knowing exactly how  proceed then  said hesitatingly “becky i—i don’t care  anybody but you” no reply—but sobs “becky”—pleadingly “becky won’t you say something” more sobs tom got out his chiefest jewel  brass knob   top   andiron  passed  around her so  she could see it  said “please becky won’t you take it” she struck    floor then tom marched out   house  over  hills  far away  return  school no more  day presently becky began  suspect she ran   door   not  sight she flew around   playyard   not there then she called “tom come back tom” she listened intently but there  no answer she had no companions but silence  loneliness so she sat down  cry again  upbraid herself   this time  scholars began  gather again  she had  hide her griefs  still her broken heart  take up  cross   long dreary aching afternoon  none among  strangers about her  exchange sorrows with chapter viii tom dodged hither  thither through lanes until   well out   track  returning scholars  then fell into  moody jog he crossed  small “branch” two or three times because   prevailing juvenile superstition   cross water baffled pursuit half  hour later   disappearing behind  douglas mansion   summit  cardiff hill   schoolhouse  hardly distinguishable away off   valley behind him he entered  dense wood picked his pathless way   centre  it  sat down   mossy spot under  spreading oak there  not even  zephyr stirring  dead noonday heat had even stilled  songs   birds nature lay   trance   broken  no sound but  occasional faroff hammering   woodpecker  this seemed  render  pervading silence  sense  loneliness  more profound the boy’s soul  steeped  melancholy his feelings   happy accord  his surroundings he sat long  his elbows  his knees  his chin  his hands meditating it seemed  him  life  but  trouble  best   more than half envied jimmy hodges so lately released  must  very peaceful  thought  lie  slumber  dream forever  ever   wind whispering through  trees  caressing  grass   flowers over  grave  nothing

dog—like  very dog she would  sorry some day—maybe when   too late ah if  could only die temporarily but  elastic heart  youth cannot  compressed into one constrained shape long   time tom presently began  drift insensibly back into  concerns  this life again what if  turned his back now  disappeared mysteriously what if  went away—ever so far away into unknown countries beyond  seas—and never came back any more how would she feel then the idea  being  clown recurred  him now only  fill him  disgust for frivolity  jokes  spotted tights   offense when they intruded themselves upon  spirit   exalted into  vague august realm   romantic no  would   soldier  return after long years all warworn  illustrious no—better still  would join  indians  hunt buffaloes  go   warpath   mountain ranges

 all his companions  unappeasable envy but no there  something gaudier even than this he would   pirate that  it now his future lay plain before him  glowing  unimaginable splendor how his name would fill  world  make people shudder how gloriously  would go plowing  dancing seas  his long low blackhulled racer  spirit   storm  his grisly flag flying   fore and   zenith  his fame how  would suddenly appear   old village  stalk into church brown  weatherbeaten  his black velvet doublet  trunks his great jackboots his crimson sash his belt bristling  horsepistols his crimerusted cutlass  his side his slouch hat  waving plumes his black flag unfurled   skull  crossbones  it  hear  swelling ecstasy  whisperings “it’s tom sawyer  pirate—the black avenger   spanish main” yes   settled his career  determined he would run away  home  enter upon it he would start  very next morning therefore  must now begin  get ready he would collect his resources together he went   rotten log near  hand  began  dig under one end    his barlow knife he soon struck wood  sounded hollow he put his hand there  uttered this incantation impressively “what hasn’t come here come what’s here stay here” then  scraped away  dirt  exposed  pine shingle he took  up  disclosed  shapely little treasurehouse whose bottom  sides   shingles in  lay  marble tom’s astonishment  boundless he scratched his head   perplexed air  said “well  beats anything” then  tossed  marble away pettishly  stood cogitating the truth was   superstition  his had failed here which   all his comrades had always looked upon  infallible if you buried  marble  certain necessary incantations  left  alone  fortnight  then opened  place   incantation  had just used you would find  all  marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there meantime no matter how widely they had been separated but now this thing had actually  unquestionably failed tom’s whole structure  faith  shaken   foundations he had many  time heard  this thing succeeding but never   failing before it did not occur  him   had tried  several times before himself but could never find  hidingplaces afterward he puzzled over  matter some time  finally decided  some witch had interfered  broken  charm he thought  would satisfy himself   point so  searched around till  found  small sandy spot   little funnelshaped depression  it he laid himself down  put his mouth close  this depression  called— “doodlebug doodlebug tell me what i want  know doodlebug doodlebug tell me what i want  know” the sand began  work  presently  small black bug appeared   second  then darted under again   fright “he dasn’t tell so  was  witch  done it i just knowed it” he well knew  futility  trying  contend against witches so  gave up discouraged but  occurred  him   might  well have  marble  had just thrown away  therefore  went  made  patient search  it but  could not find it now  went back  his treasurehouse  carefully placed himself just   had been standing when  tossed  marble away then  took another marble  his pocket  tossed    same way saying “brother go find your brother” he watched where  stopped  went there  looked but  must have fallen short or gone too far so  tried twice more the last repetition  successful the two marbles lay within  foot  each other just here  blast   toy tin trumpet came faintly down  green aisles   forest tom flung off his jacket  trousers turned  suspender into  belt raked away some brush behind  rotten log disclosing  rude bow  arrow  lath sword   tin trumpet    moment had seized these things  bounded away barelegged  fluttering shirt he presently halted under  great elm blew  answering blast  then began  tiptoe  look warily out this way  that he said cautiously—to  imaginary company “hold my merry men keep hid till i blow” now appeared joe harper  airily clad  elaborately armed  tom tom called “hold who comes here into sherwood forest without my pass” “guy  guisborne wants no man’s pass who art thou that—that—” “dares  hold such language” said tom prompting—for they talked “by  book”  memory “who art thou  dares  hold such language” “i indeed i am robin hood  thy caitiff carcase soon shall know” “then art thou indeed  famous outlaw right gladly  i dispute  thee  passes   merry wood have  thee” they took their lath swords dumped their other traps   ground struck  fencing attitude foot  foot  began  grave careful combat “two up  two down” presently tom said “now if you’ve got  hang go  lively” so they “went  lively” panting  perspiring   work by   tom shouted “fall

guy  guisborne’ you’re  turn around  let me hit you   back” there  no getting around  authorities so joe turned received  whack  fell “now” said joe getting up “you got  let me kill you that’s fair” “why i can’t do that  ain’t   book” “well it’s blamed mean—that’s all” “well say joe you can  friar tuck or much  miller’s son  lam me   quarterstaff or i’ll   sheriff  nottingham  you  robin hood  little while  kill me” this  satisfactory  so these adventures  carried out then tom became robin hood again   allowed   treacherous nun  bleed his strength away through his neglected wound and  last joe representing  whole tribe  weeping outlaws dragged him sadly forth gave his bow into his feeble hands  tom said “where this arrow falls there bury poor robin hood under  greenwood tree” then  shot  arrow  fell back  would have died but  lit   nettle  sprang up too gaily   corpse the boys dressed themselves hid their accoutrements  went off grieving  there  no outlaws any more  wondering what modern civilization could claim  have done  compensate  their loss they said they would rather  outlaws  year  sherwood forest than president   united states forever chapter ix at halfpast nine  night tom  sid  sent  bed  usual they said their prayers  sid  soon asleep tom lay awake  waited  restless impatience when  seemed  him   must  nearly daylight  heard  clock strike ten this  despair he would have tossed  fidgeted  his nerves demanded but   afraid  might wake sid so  lay still  stared up into  dark everything  dismally still by  by out   stillness little scarcely perceptible noises began  emphasize themselves the ticking   clock began  bring itself into notice old beams began  crack mysteriously the stairs creaked faintly evidently spirits  abroad a measured muffled snore issued  aunt polly’s chamber and now  tiresome chirping   cricket  no human ingenuity could locate began next  ghastly ticking   deathwatch   wall   bed’s head made tom shudder—it meant  somebody’s days  numbered then  howl   faroff dog rose   night air   answered   fainter howl   remoter distance tom    agony at last   satisfied  time had ceased  eternity begun  began  doze  spite  himself  clock chimed eleven but  did not hear it and then there came mingling  his halfformed dreams  most melancholy caterwauling the raising   neighboring window disturbed him a cry  “scat you devil”   crash   empty bottle against  back  his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake   single minute later   dressed  out   window  creeping along  roof   “ell”  all fours he “meow’d”  caution once or twice   went then jumped   roof   woodshed  thence   ground huckleberry finn  there  his dead cat the boys moved off  disappeared   gloom at  end  half  hour they  wading through  tall grass   graveyard it   graveyard   oldfashioned western kind it    hill about  mile   half   village it had  crazy board fence around it which leaned inward  places  outward  rest   time but stood upright nowhere grass  weeds grew rank over  whole cemetery all  old graves  sunken in there  not  tombstone   place roundtopped wormeaten boards staggered over  graves leaning  support  finding none “sacred   memory of” soandso had been painted  them once but  could no longer have been read   most  them now even if there had been light a faint wind moaned through  trees  tom feared  might   spirits   dead complaining  being disturbed the boys talked little  only under their breath   time   place   pervading solemnity  silence oppressed their spirits they found  sharp new heap they  seeking  ensconced themselves within  protection  three great elms  grew   bunch within  few feet   grave then they waited  silence  what seemed  long time the hooting   distant owl  all  sound  troubled  dead stillness tom’s reflections grew oppressive he must force some talk so  said   whisper “hucky do you believe  dead people like   us   here” huckleberry whispered “i wisht i knowed it’s awful solemn like ain’t it” “i bet  is” there   considerable pause while  boys canvassed this matter inwardly then tom whispered “say hucky—do you reckon hoss williams hears us talking” “o’ course  does least his sperrit does” tom after  pause “i wish i’d said mister williams but i never meant any harm everybody calls him hoss” “a body can’t  too partic’lar how they talk ’bout theseyer dead people tom” this   damper  conversation died again presently tom seized his comrade’s arm  said “sh” “what  it tom” and  two clung together  beating hearts “sh there ’tis again didn’t you hear it” “i—” “there now you hear it” “lord tom they’re coming they’re coming sure what’ll we do” “i dono think they’ll see us” “oh tom they can see   dark same  cats i wisht i hadn’t come” “oh don’t  afeard i don’t believe they’ll bother us we ain’t doing any harm if we keep perfectly still maybe they won’t notice us  all” “i’ll try to tom but lord i’m all   shiver” “listen” the boys bent their heads together  scarcely breathed a muffled sound  voices floated up   far end   graveyard “look see there” whispered tom “what  it” “it’s devilfire oh tom this  awful” some vague figures approached through  gloom swinging  oldfashioned tin lantern  freckled  ground  innumerable little spangles  light presently huckleberry whispered   shudder “it’s  devils sure enough three  ’em lordy tom we’re goners can you pray” “i’ll try but don’t you  afeard they ain’t going  hurt us ‘now i lay me down  sleep i—’” “sh” “what  it huck” “they’re humans one  ’em is anyway one  ’em’s old muff potter’s voice” “no—’tain’t so  it” “i bet i know it don’t you stir nor budge he ain’t sharp enough  notice us drunk  same  usual likely—blamed old rip” “all right i’ll keep still now they’re stuck can’t find it here they come again now they’re hot cold again hot again red hot they’re p’inted right this time say huck i know another o’ them voices it’s injun joe” “that’s so—that murderin’ halfbreed i’d druther they  devils  dern sight what kin they  up to” the whisper died wholly out now   three men had reached  grave  stood within  few feet   boys’ hidingplace “here  is” said  third voice   owner   held  lantern up  revealed  face  young doctor robinson potter  injun joe  carrying  handbarrow   rope   couple  shovels  it they cast down their load  began  open  grave the doctor put  lantern   head   grave  came  sat down  his back against one   elm trees he  so close  boys could have touched him “hurry men”  said   low voice “the moon might come out  any moment” they growled  response  went  digging for some time there  no noise but  grating sound   spades discharging their freight  mould  gravel it  very monotonous finally  spade struck upon  coffin   dull woody accent  within another minute or two  men had hoisted  out   ground they pried off  lid  their shovels got out  body  dumped  rudely   ground the moon drifted  behind  clouds  exposed  pallid face the barrow  got ready   corpse placed  it covered   blanket  bound   place   rope potter took out  large springknife  cut off  dangling end   rope  then said “now  cussed thing’s ready sawbones  you’ll just out  another five or here she stays” “that’s  talk” said injun joe “look here what does this mean” said  doctor “you required your pay  advance  i’ve paid you” “yes  you done more than that” said injun joe approaching  doctor who  now standing “five years ago you drove me away  your father’s kitchen one night when i come  ask  something  eat  you said i warn’t there  any good  when i swore i’d get even  you if  took  hundred years your father had me jailed   vagrant did you think i’d forget the injun blood ain’t  me  nothing and now i’ve got you  you got  settle you know” he  threatening  doctor  his fist  his face  this time the doctor struck out suddenly  stretched  ruffian   ground potter dropped his knife  exclaimed “here now don’t you hit my pard”   next moment  had grappled   doctor   two  struggling  might  main trampling  grass  tearing  ground  their heels injun joe sprang  his feet his eyes flaming  passion snatched up potter’s knife  went creeping catlike  stooping round  round about  combatants seeking  opportunity all  once  doctor flung himself free seized  heavy headboard  williams’ grave  felled potter   earth  it—and   same instant  halfbreed saw his chance  drove  knife   hilt   young man’s breast he reeled  fell partly upon potter flooding him  his blood    same moment  clouds blotted out  dreadful spectacle   two frightened boys went speeding away   dark presently when  moon emerged again injun joe  standing over  two forms contemplating them the doctor murmured inarticulately gave  long gasp or two   still the halfbreed muttered “that score  settled—damn you” then  robbed  body after which  put  fatal knife  potter’s open right hand  sat down   dismantled coffin three—four—five minutes passed  then potter began  stir  moan his hand closed upon  knife  raised it glanced  it  let  fall   shudder then  sat up pushing  body  him  gazed  it  then around him confusedly his eyes met joe’s “lord how  this joe”  said “it’s  dirty business” said joe without moving “what did you do  for” “i i never done it” “look here that kind  talk won’t wash” potter trembled  grew white “i thought i’d got sober i’d no business  drink tonight but it’s  my head yet—worse’n when we started here i’m all   muddle can’t recollect anything  it hardly tell me joe—honest now old feller—did i do it joe i never meant to—’pon my soul  honor i never meant to joe tell me how  was joe oh it’s awful—and him so young  promising” “why you two  scuffling   fetched you one   headboard  you fell flat  then up you come all reeling  staggering like  snatched  knife  jammed  into him just   fetched you another awful clip—and here you’ve laid  dead   wedge til now” “oh i didn’t know what i  adoing i wish i may die this minute if i did it  all  account   whiskey   excitement i reckon i never used  weepon  my life before joe i’ve fought but never  weepons they’ll all say that joe don’t tell say you won’t tell joe—that’s  good feller i always liked you joe  stood up  you too don’t you remember you won’t tell will you joe” and  poor creature dropped  his knees before  stolid murderer  clasped his appealing hands “no you’ve always been fair  square  me muff potter  i won’t go back  you there now that’s  fair   man can say” “oh joe you’re  angel i’ll bless you  this  longest day i live” and potter began  cry “come now that’s enough  that this ain’t any time  blubbering you  off yonder way  i’ll go this move now  don’t leave any tracks behind you” potter started   trot  quickly increased   run the halfbreed stood looking after him he muttered “if he’s  much stunned   lick  fuddled   rum   had  look  being  won’t think   knife till he’s gone so far he’ll  afraid  come back after   such  place  himself—chickenheart” two or three minutes later  murdered man  blanketed corpse  lidless coffin   open grave  under no inspection but  moon’s the stillness  complete again too chapter x the two boys flew   on toward  village speechless  horror they glanced backward over their shoulders  time  time apprehensively  if they feared they might  followed every stump  started up  their path seemed  man   enemy  made them catch their breath   they sped  some outlying cottages  lay near  village  barking   aroused watchdogs seemed  give wings  their feet “if we can only get   old tannery before we break down” whispered tom  short catches between breaths “i can’t stand  much longer” huckleberry’s hard pantings  his only reply   boys fixed their eyes   goal  their hopes  bent  their work  win it they gained steadily  it   last breast  breast they burst through  open door  fell grateful  exhausted   sheltering shadows beyond by   their pulses slowed down  tom whispered “huckleberry what do you reckon’ll come  this” “if doctor robinson dies i reckon hanging’ll come  it” “do you though” “why i know it tom” tom thought  while then  said “who’ll tell we” “what  you talking about s’pose something happened  injun joe didn’t hang why he’d kill us some time or other just  dead sure  we’re  laying here” “that’s just what i  thinking  myself huck” “if anybody tells let muff potter do it if he’s fool enough he’s generally drunk enough” tom said nothing—went  thinking presently  whispered “huck muff potter don’t know it how can  tell” “what’s  reason  don’t know it” “because he’d just got  whack when injun joe done it d’you reckon  could see anything d’you reckon  knowed anything” “by hokey that’s so tom” “and besides lookahere—maybe  whack done  him” “no ’taint likely tom he had liquor  him i could see that  besides  always has well when pap’s full you might take  belt him over  head   church  you couldn’t phase him he says so his own self so it’s  same  muff potter  course but if  man  dead sober i reckon maybe  whack might fetch him i dono” after another reflective silence tom said “hucky you sure you can keep mum” “tom we got  keep mum you know that that injun devil wouldn’t make any more  drownding us than  couple  cats if we   squeak ’bout this  they didn’t hang him now lookahere tom less take  swear  one another—that’s what we got  do—swear  keep mum” “i’m agreed it’s  best thing would you just hold hands  swear  we—” “oh no  wouldn’t do  this that’s good enough  little rubbishy common things—specially  gals cuz they go back  you anyway  blab if they get   huff—but there orter  writing ’bout  big thing like this and blood” tom’s whole being applauded this idea it  deep  dark  awful  hour  circumstances  surroundings   keeping  it he picked up  clean pine shingle  lay   moonlight took  little fragment  “red keel” out  his pocket got  moon  his work  painfully scrawled these lines emphasizing each slow downstroke  clamping his tongue between his teeth  letting up  pressure   upstrokes see next page “huck finn  tom sawyer swears they  keep mum about this  they wish they may drop down dead  their tracks if they ever tell  rot” huckleberry  filled  admiration  tom’s facility  writing   sublimity  his language he  once took  pin  his lapel   going  prick his flesh but tom said “hold on don’t do that a pin’s brass it might have verdigrease  it” “what’s verdigrease” “it’s p’ison that’s what  is you just swaller some   once—you’ll see” so tom unwound  thread  one  his needles  each boy pricked  ball  his thumb  squeezed out  drop  blood in time after many squeezes tom managed  sign his initials using  ball  his little finger   pen then  showed huckleberry how  make  h   f   oath  complete they buried  shingle close   wall  some dismal ceremonies  incantations   fetters  bound their tongues  considered   locked   key thrown away a figure crept stealthily through  break   other end   ruined building now but they did not notice it “tom” whispered huckleberry “does this keep us  ever telling—always” “of course  does it don’t make any difference what happens we got  keep mum we’d drop down dead—don’t you know that” “yes i reckon that’s so” they continued  whisper  some little time presently  dog set up  long lugubrious howl just outside—within ten feet  them the boys clasped each other suddenly   agony  fright “which  us does  mean” gasped huckleberry “i dono—peep through  crack quick” “no you tom” “i can’t—i can’t do it huck” “please tom there ’tis again” “oh lordy i’m thankful” whispered tom “i know his voice it’s bull harbison”   if mr harbison owned  slave named bull tom would have spoken  him  “harbison’s bull” but  son or  dog   name  “bull harbison” “oh that’s good—i tell you tom i  most scared  death i’d  bet anything    stray dog” the dog howled again the boys’ hearts sank once more “oh my  ain’t no bull harbison” whispered huckleberry “do tom” tom quaking  fear yielded  put his eye   crack his whisper  hardly audible when  said “oh huck its  stray dog” “quick tom quick who does  mean” “huck  must mean us both—we’re right together” “oh tom i reckon we’re goners i reckon there ain’t no mistake ’bout where i’ll go to i been so wicked” “dad fetch it this comes  playing hookey  doing everything  feller’s told not  do i might  been good like sid if i’d  tried—but no i wouldn’t  course but if ever i get off this time i lay i’ll just waller  sundayschools” and tom began  snuffle  little “you bad”  huckleberry began  snuffle too “consound it tom sawyer you’re just old pie ’longside o’ what i am oh lordy lordy lordy i wisht i only had half your chance” tom choked off  whispered “look hucky look he’s got his back  us” hucky looked  joy  his heart “well  has  jingoes did  before” “yes  did but i like  fool never thought oh this  bully you know now who can  mean” the howling stopped tom pricked up his ears “sh what’s that”  whispered “sounds like—like hogs grunting no—it’s somebody snoring tom” “that is it where ’bouts  it huck” “i bleeve it’s down  ’tother end sounds so anyway pap used  sleep there sometimes ’long   hogs but laws bless you  just lifts things when he snores besides i reckon  ain’t ever coming back  this town any more” the spirit  adventure rose   boys’ souls once more “hucky do you das’t  go if i lead” “i don’t like to much tom s’pose it’s injun joe” tom quailed but presently  temptation rose up strong again   boys agreed  try   understanding  they would take  their heels if  snoring stopped so they went tiptoeing stealthily down  one behind  other when they had got  within five steps   snorer tom stepped   stick   broke   sharp snap the man moaned writhed  little  his face came into  moonlight it  muff potter the boys’ hearts had stood still  their hopes too when  man moved but their fears passed away now they tiptoed out through  broken weatherboarding  stopped   little distance  exchange  parting word that long lugubrious howl rose   night air again they turned  saw  strange dog standing within  few feet  where potter  lying  facing potter  his nose pointing heavenward “oh geeminy it’s him” exclaimed both boys   breath “say tom—they say  stray dog come howling around johnny miller’s house ’bout midnight  much  two weeks ago   whippoorwill come   lit   banisters  sung  very same evening  there ain’t anybody dead there yet” “well i know that and suppose there ain’t didn’t gracie miller fall   kitchen fire  burn herself terrible  very next saturday” “yes but she ain’t dead and what’s more she’s getting better too” “all right you wait  see she’s  goner just  dead sure  muff potter’s  goner that’s what  niggers say  they know all about these kind  things huck” then they separated cogitating when tom crept   his bedroom window  night  almost spent he undressed  excessive caution  fell asleep

washing himself   “branch” about one or two o’clock   morning   potter had  once sneaked off—suspicious circumstances especially  washing which  not  habit  potter it  also said   town had been

unaccountable fascination drew him on arrived   dreadful place  wormed his small body through  crowd  saw  dismal spectacle it seemed  him  age since   there before somebody pinched his arm he turned  his eyes met huckleberry’s then both looked elsewhere  once  wondered if anybody had noticed anything  their mutual glance but everybody  talking  intent upon  grisly spectacle before them “poor fellow” “poor young fellow” “this ought    lesson  grave robbers” “muff potter’ll hang  this if they catch him” this   drift  remark   minister said “it   judgment his hand  here” now tom shivered  head  heel  his eye fell upon  stolid face  injun joe at this moment  crowd began  sway  struggle  voices shouted “it’s him it’s him he’s coming himself” “who who”  twenty voices “muff potter” “hallo he’s stopped—look out he’s turning don’t let him get away” people   branches   trees over tom’s head said  wasn’t trying  get away—he only looked doubtful  perplexed “infernal impudence” said  bystander “wanted  come  take  quiet look  his work i reckon—didn’t expect any company” the crowd fell apart now   sheriff came through ostentatiously leading potter   arm the poor fellow’s face  haggard  his eyes showed  fear   upon him when  stood before  murdered man  shook    palsy   put his face  his hands  burst into tears “i didn’t do it friends”  sobbed “’pon my word  honor i never

“why didn’t you leave what did you want  come here for” somebody said “i couldn’t help it—i couldn’t help it” potter moaned “i wanted  run away but i couldn’t seem  come anywhere but here” and  fell  sobbing again injun joe repeated his statement just  calmly  few minutes afterward   inquest under oath   boys seeing   lightnings  still withheld  confirmed  their belief  joe had sold himself

 this happy circumstance would turn suspicion   right direction but they  disappointed  more than one villager remarked “it  within three feet  muff potter when  done it” tom’s fearful secret  gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep   much   week after this   breakfast one morning sid said “tom you pitch around  talk  your sleep so much  you keep me awake half  time” tom blanched  dropped his eyes “it’s  bad sign” said aunt polly gravely “what you got  your mind tom” “nothing nothing ’t i know of” but  boy’s hand shook so   spilled his coffee “and you do talk such stuff” sid said “last night you said ‘it’s blood it’s blood that’s what  is’ you said  over  over and you said ‘don’t torment me so—i’ll tell’ tell what what   you’ll tell” everything  swimming before tom there  no telling what might have happened now but luckily  concern passed out  aunt polly’s face  she came  tom’s relief without knowing it she said “sho it’s  dreadful murder i dream about  most every night myself sometimes i dream it’s me  done it” mary said she had been affected much  same way sid seemed satisfied tom got out   presence  quick   plausibly could  after   complained  toothache   week  tied up

sort  life might  romantic enough  his blighted condition but   getting  have too little sentiment  too much distracting variety about it so  thought over various plans  relief  finally hit upon   professing   fond  painkiller he asked   so often   became  nuisance  his aunt ended  telling him  help himself  quit bothering her if  had been sid she would have had no misgivings  alloy her delight but since   tom she watched  bottle clandestinely she found   medicine did really diminish but  did not occur  her   boy  mending  health   crack   sittingroom floor  it one day tom    act  dosing  crack when his aunt’s yellow cat came along purring eyeing  teaspoon avariciously  begging   taste tom said “don’t ask   unless you want it peter” but peter signified   did want it “you better make sure” peter  sure “now you’ve asked  it  i’ll give   you because there ain’t anything mean about me but if you find you don’t like it you mustn’t blame anybody but your own self” peter  agreeable so tom pried his mouth open  poured down  painkiller peter sprang  couple  yards   air  then delivered  warwhoop  set off round  round  room banging against furniture upsetting flowerpots  making general havoc next  rose  his hind feet  pranced around   frenzy  enjoyment  his head over his shoulder  his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness then  went tearing around  house again spreading chaos  destruction  his path aunt polly entered  time  see him throw  few double summersets deliver  final mighty hurrah  sail through  open window carrying  rest   flowerpots  him the old lady stood petrified  astonishment peering over her glasses tom lay   floor expiring  laughter “tom what  earth ails  cat” “i don’t know aunt” gasped  boy “why i never see anything like it what did make him act so” “deed i don’t know aunt polly cats always act so when they’re having  good time” “they do do they” there  something   tone  made tom apprehensive “yes’m that is i believe they do” “you do” “yes’m” the old lady  bending down tom watching  interest emphasized  anxiety too late  divined her “drift” the handle   telltale teaspoon  visible under  bedvalance aunt polly took it held  up tom winced  dropped his eyes aunt polly raised him   usual handle—his ear—and cracked his head soundly  her thimble “now sir what did you want  treat  poor dumb beast so for” “i done  out  pity  him—because  hadn’t any aunt” “hadn’t any aunt—you numskull what   got  do  it” “heaps because if he’d had one she’d  burnt him out herself she’d  roasted his bowels out  him ’thout any more feeling than if    human” aunt polly felt  sudden pang  remorse this  putting  thing   new light what  cruelty   cat might  cruelty   boy too she began  soften she felt sorry her eyes watered  little  she put her hand  tom’s head  said gently “i  meaning   best tom and tom  did do you good” tom looked up  her face  just  perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity “i know you  meaning   best aunty  so  i  peter it done him good too i never see him get around so since—” “oh go ’long  you tom before you aggravate me again and you try  see if you can’t   good boy  once  you needn’t take any more medicine” tom reached school ahead  time it  noticed  this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly and now  usual  late  hung about  gate   schoolyard instead  playing  his comrades he  sick  said   looked it he tried  seem   looking everywhere but whither  really  looking—down  road presently jeff thatcher hove  sight  tom’s face lighted  gazed  moment  then turned sorrowfully away when jeff arrived tom accosted him  “led up” warily  opportunities  remark about becky but  giddy lad never could see  bait tom watched  watched hoping whenever  frisking frock came  sight  hating  owner    soon   saw she  not  right one at last frocks ceased  appear   dropped hopelessly into  dumps  entered  empty schoolhouse  sat down  suffer then one more frock passed    gate  tom’s heart gave  great bound the next instant   out  “going on” like  indian yelling laughing chasing boys jumping over  fence  risk  life  limb throwing handsprings standing  his head—doing all  heroic things  could conceive of  keeping  furtive eye out all  while  see if becky thatcher  noticing but she seemed   unconscious   all she never looked could   possible  she  not aware    there he carried his exploits  her immediate vicinity came warwhooping around snatched  boy’s cap hurled    roof   schoolhouse broke through  group  boys tumbling them  every direction  fell sprawling himself under becky’s nose almost upsetting her—and she turned  her nose   air   heard her say “mf some people think they’re mighty smart—always showing off” tom’s cheeks burned he gathered himself up  sneaked off crushed  crestfallen chapter xiii tom’s mind  made up now he  gloomy  desperate he   forsaken friendless boy  said nobody loved him when they found out what they had driven him to perhaps they would  sorry  had tried  do right  get along but they would not let him since nothing would do them but   rid  him let   so  let them blame him   consequences—why shouldn’t they what right had  friendless  complain yes they had forced him    last  would lead  life  crime there  no choice by this time   far down meadow lane   bell  school  “take up” tinkled faintly upon his ear he sobbed now  think  should never never hear  old familiar sound any more—it  very hard but   forced  him since   driven out into  cold world  must submit—but  forgave them then  sobs came thick  fast just  this point  met his soul’s sworn comrade joe harper—hardeyed   evidently  great  dismal purpose  his heart plainly here  “two souls  but  single thought” tom wiping his eyes  his sleeve began  blubber out something about  resolution  escape  hard usage  lack  sympathy  home  roaming abroad into  great world never  return  ended  hoping  joe would not forget him but  transpired  this   request which joe had just been going  make  tom  had come  hunt him up   purpose his mother had whipped him  drinking some cream which  had never tasted  knew nothing about   plain  she  tired  him  wished him  go if she felt  way there  nothing  him  do but succumb  hoped she would  happy  never regret having driven her poor boy out into  unfeeling world  suffer  die as  two boys walked sorrowing along they made  new compact  stand  each other   brothers  never separate till death relieved them  their troubles then they began  lay their plans joe   being  hermit  living  crusts   remote cave  dying some time  cold  want  grief but after listening  tom  conceded  there  some conspicuous advantages about  life  crime  so  consented    pirate three miles below st petersburg   point where  mississippi river   trifle over  mile wide there   long narrow wooded island   shallow bar   head  it  this offered well   rendezvous it  not inhabited  lay far over toward  further shore abreast  dense  almost wholly unpeopled forest so jackson’s island  chosen who     subjects  their piracies   matter  did not occur  them then they hunted up huckleberry finn   joined them promptly  all careers  one  him   indifferent they presently separated  meet   lonely spot   riverbank two miles above  village   favorite hour—which  midnight there   small log raft there which they meant  capture each would bring hooks  lines  such provision   could steal   most dark  mysterious way—as became outlaws and before  afternoon  done they had all managed  enjoy  sweet glory  spreading  fact  pretty soon  town would “hear something” all who got this vague hint  cautioned  “be mum  wait” about midnight tom arrived   boiled ham   few trifles  stopped   dense undergrowth   small bluff overlooking  meetingplace it  starlight  very still the mighty river lay like  ocean  rest tom listened  moment but no sound disturbed  quiet then  gave  low distinct whistle it  answered  under  bluff tom whistled twice more these signals  answered   same way then  guarded voice said “who goes there” “tom sawyer  black avenger   spanish main name your names” “huck finn  redhanded  joe harper  terror   seas” tom had furnished these titles  his favorite literature “’tis well give  countersign” two hoarse whispers delivered  same awful word simultaneously   brooding night “blood” then tom tumbled his ham over  bluff  let himself down after it tearing both skin  clothes  some extent   effort there   easy comfortable path along  shore under  bluff but  lacked  advantages  difficulty  danger so valued   pirate the terror   seas had brought  side  bacon  had about worn himself out  getting  there finn  redhanded had stolen  skillet   quantity  halfcured leaf tobacco  had also brought  few corncobs  make pipes with but none   pirates smoked or “chewed” but himself the black avenger   spanish main said  would never do  start without some fire that   wise thought matches  hardly known there   day they saw  fire smouldering upon  great raft  hundred yards above  they went stealthily thither  helped themselves   chunk they made  imposing adventure  it saying “hist” every now  then  suddenly halting  finger  lip moving  hands  imaginary daggerhilts  giving orders  dismal whispers  if “the foe” stirred  “let him have    hilt” because “dead men tell no tales” they knew well enough   raftsmen  all down   village laying  stores or having  spree but still   no excuse  their conducting this thing   unpiratical way they shoved off presently tom  command huck   after oar  joe   forward tom stood amidships gloomybrowed   folded arms  gave his orders   low stern whisper “luff  bring her   wind” “ayeaye sir” “steady steadyyyy” “steady  is sir” “let her go off  point” “point  is sir” as  boys steadily  monotonously drove  raft toward midstream   no doubt understood  these orders  given only  “style”   not intended  mean anything  particular “what sail’s she carrying” “courses tops’ls  flyingjib sir” “send  r’yals up lay out aloft there half  dozen  ye—foretopmaststuns’l lively now” “ayeaye sir” “shake out  maintogalans’l sheets  braces now my hearties” “ayeaye sir” “hellumalee—hard  port stand   meet her when she comes port port now men with  will steadyyy” “steady  is sir” the raft drew beyond  middle   river  boys pointed her head right  then lay  their oars the river  not high so there  not more than  two or three mile current hardly  word  said during  next threequarters   hour now  raft  passing before  distant town two or three glimmering lights showed where  lay peacefully sleeping beyond  vague vast sweep  stargemmed water unconscious   tremendous event   happening the black avenger stood still  folded arms “looking his last” upon  scene  his former joys  his later sufferings  wishing “she” could see him now abroad   wild sea facing peril  death  dauntless heart going  his doom   grim smile  his lips it  but  small strain  his imagination  remove jackson’s island beyond eyeshot   village  so  “looked his last”   broken  satisfied heart the other pirates  looking their last too  they all looked so long  they came near letting  current drift them out   range   island but they discovered  danger  time  made shift  avert it about two o’clock   morning  raft grounded   bar two hundred yards above  head   island  they waded back  forth until they had landed their freight part   little raft’s belongings consisted   old sail  this they spread over  nook   bushes   tent  shelter their provisions but they themselves would sleep   open air  good weather  became outlaws they built  fire against  side   great log twenty or thirty steps within  sombre depths   forest  then cooked some bacon   fryingpan  supper  used up half   corn “pone” stock they had brought it seemed glorious sport   feasting   wild free way   virgin forest   unexplored  uninhabited island far   haunts  men  they said they never would return  civilization the climbing fire lit up their faces  threw  ruddy glare upon  pillared treetrunks  their forest temple  upon  varnished foliage  festooning vines when  last crisp slice  bacon  gone   last allowance  corn pone devoured  boys stretched themselves out   grass filled  contentment they could have found  cooler place but they would not deny themselves such  romantic feature   roasting campfire “ain’t  gay” said joe “it’s nuts” said tom “what would  boys say if they could see us” “say well they’d just die   here—hey hucky” “i reckon so” said huckleberry “anyways i’m suited i don’t want nothing better’n this i don’t ever get enough  eat gen’ally—and here they can’t come  pick   feller  bullyrag him so” “it’s just  life  me” said tom “you don’t have  get up mornings  you don’t have  go  school  wash  all  blame foolishness you see  pirate don’t have  do anything joe when he’s ashore but  hermit he    praying considerable  then  don’t have any fun anyway all  himself  way” “oh yes that’s so” said joe “but i hadn’t thought much about it you know i’d  good deal rather   pirate now  i’ve tried it” “you see” said tom “people don’t go much  hermits nowadays like they used   old times but  pirate’s always respected and  hermit’s got  sleep   hardest place  can find  put sackcloth  ashes  his head  stand out   rain and—” “what does  put sackcloth  ashes  his head for” inquired huck “i dono but they’ve got  do it hermits always do you’d have  do  if you   hermit” “dern’d if i would” said huck “well what would you do” “i dono but i wouldn’t do that” “why huck you’d have to how’d you get around it” “why i just wouldn’t stand it i’d run away” “run away well you would   nice old slouch   hermit you’d   disgrace” the redhanded made no response being better employed he had finished gouging out  cob  now  fitted  weed stem  it loaded   tobacco   pressing  coal   charge  blowing  cloud  fragrant smoke—he    full bloom  luxurious contentment the other pirates envied him this majestic vice  secretly resolved  acquire  shortly presently huck said “what does pirates have  do” tom said “oh they have just  bully time—take ships  burn them  get  money  bury   awful places  their island where there’s ghosts  things  watch it  kill everybody   ships—make ’em walk  plank” “and they carry  women   island” said joe “they don’t kill  women” “no” assented tom “they don’t kill  women—they’re too noble and  women’s always beautiful too “and don’t they wear  bulliest clothes oh no all gold  silver  di’monds” said joe  enthusiasm “who” said huck “why  pirates” huck scanned his own clothing forlornly “i reckon i ain’t dressed fitten   pirate” said he   regretful pathos  his voice “but i ain’t got none but these” but  other boys told him  fine clothes would come fast enough after they should have begun their adventures they made him understand  his poor rags would do  begin with though   customary  wealthy pirates  start   proper wardrobe gradually their talk died out  drowsiness began  steal upon  eyelids   little waifs the pipe dropped   fingers   redhanded   slept  sleep   consciencefree   weary the terror   seas   black avenger   spanish main had more difficulty  getting  sleep they said their prayers inwardly  lying down since there  nobody there  authority  make them kneel  recite aloud  truth they had  mind not  say them  all but they  afraid  proceed  such lengths  that lest they might call down  sudden  special thunderbolt  heaven then  once they reached  hovered upon  imminent verge  sleep—but  intruder came now  would not “down” it  conscience they began  feel  vague fear  they had been doing wrong  run away  next they thought   stolen meat  then  real torture came they tried  argue  away  reminding conscience  they had purloined sweetmeats  apples scores  times but conscience  not   appeased  such thin plausibilities  seemed  them   end  there  no getting around  stubborn fact  taking sweetmeats  only “hooking” while taking bacon  hams  such valuables  plain simple stealing—and there   command against    bible so they inwardly resolved  so long  they remained   business their piracies should not again  sullied   crime  stealing then conscience granted  truce  these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully  sleep chapter xiv when tom awoke   morning  wondered where  was he sat up  rubbed his eyes  looked around then  comprehended it   cool gray dawn  there   delicious sense  repose  peace   deep pervading calm  silence   woods not  leaf stirred not  sound obtruded upon great nature’s meditation beaded dewdrops stood upon  leaves  grasses a white layer  ashes covered  fire   thin blue breath  smoke rose straight into  air joe  huck still slept now far away   woods  bird called another answered presently  hammering   woodpecker  heard gradually  cool dim gray   morning whitened   gradually sounds multiplied  life manifested itself the marvel  nature shaking off sleep  going  work unfolded itself   musing boy a little green worm came crawling over  dewy leaf lifting twothirds  his body into  air  time  time  “sniffing around” then proceeding again—for   measuring tom said  when  worm approached him   own accord  sat  still   stone  his hopes rising  falling  turns   creature still came toward him or seemed inclined  go elsewhere  when  last  considered  painful moment   curved body   air  then came decisively down upon tom’s leg  began  journey over him his whole heart  glad—for  meant    going  have  new suit  clothes—without  shadow   doubt  gaudy piratical uniform now  procession  ants appeared  nowhere  particular  went about their labors one struggled manfully    dead spider five times  big  itself   arms  lugged  straight up  treetrunk a brown spotted ladybug climbed  dizzy height   grass blade  tom bent down close    said “ladybug ladybug fly away home your house   fire your children’s alone”  she took wing  went off  see about it—which did not surprise  boy   knew  old  this insect  credulous about conflagrations   had practised upon  simplicity more than once a tumblebug came next heaving sturdily   ball  tom touched  creature  see  shut  legs against  body  pretend   dead the birds  fairly rioting  this time a catbird  northern mocker lit   tree over tom’s head  trilled out her imitations  her neighbors   rapture  enjoyment then  shrill jay swept down  flash  blue flame  stopped   twig almost within  boy’s reach cocked his head  one side  eyed  strangers   consuming curiosity  gray squirrel   big fellow   “fox” kind came skurrying along sitting up  intervals  inspect  chatter   boys   wild things had probably never seen  human being before  scarcely knew whether   afraid or not all nature  wide awake  stirring now long lances  sunlight pierced down through  dense foliage far  near   few butterflies came fluttering upon  scene tom stirred up  other pirates  they all clattered away   shout    minute or two  stripped  chasing after  tumbling over each other   shallow limpid water   white sandbar they felt no longing   little village sleeping   distance beyond  majestic waste  water a vagrant current or  slight rise   river had carried off their raft but this only gratified them since  going  something like burning  bridge between them  civilization they came back  camp wonderfully refreshed gladhearted  ravenous  they soon had  campfire blazing up again huck found  spring  clear cold water close by   boys made cups  broad oak or hickory leaves  felt  water sweetened  such  wildwood charm  that would   good enough substitute  coffee while joe  slicing bacon  breakfast tom  huck asked him  hold   minute they stepped   promising nook   riverbank  threw  their lines almost immediately they had reward joe had not had time  get impatient before they  back again  some handsome bass  couple  sunperch   small catfish—provisions enough  quite  family they fried  fish   bacon   astonished  no fish had ever seemed so delicious before they did not know   quicker  freshwater fish    fire after   caught  better  is  they reflected little upon what  sauce openair sleeping openair exercise bathing   large ingredient  hunger make too they lay around   shade after breakfast while huck had  smoke  then went off through  woods   exploring expedition they tramped gayly along over decaying logs through tangled underbrush among solemn monarchs   forest hung  their crowns   ground   drooping regalia  grapevines now  then they came upon snug nooks carpeted  grass  jeweled  flowers they found plenty  things   delighted with but nothing   astonished at they discovered   island  about three miles long   quarter   mile wide    shore  lay closest   only separated     narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide they took  swim about every hour so   close upon  middle   afternoon when they got back  camp they  too hungry  stop  fish but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham  then threw themselves down   shade  talk but  talk soon began  drag  then died the stillness  solemnity  brooded   woods   sense  loneliness began  tell upon  spirits   boys they fell  thinking a sort  undefined longing crept upon them this took dim shape presently—it  budding homesickness even finn  redhanded  dreaming  his doorsteps  empty hogsheads but they  all ashamed  their weakness  none  brave enough  speak his thought for some time now  boys had been dully conscious   peculiar sound   distance just  one sometimes    ticking   clock which  takes no distinct note of but now this mysterious sound became more pronounced  forced  recognition the boys started glanced  each other  then each assumed  listening attitude there   long silence profound  unbroken then  deep sullen boom came floating down out   distance “what  it” exclaimed joe under his breath “i wonder” said tom   whisper “’tain’t thunder” said huckleberry   awed tone “becuz thunder—” “hark” said tom “listen—don’t talk” they waited  time  seemed  age  then  same muffled boom troubled  solemn hush “let’s go  see” they sprang  their feet  hurried   shore toward  town they parted  bushes   bank  peered out over  water the little steam ferryboat  about  mile below  village drifting   current her broad deck seemed crowded  people there   great many skiffs rowing about or floating   stream   neighborhood   ferryboat but  boys could not determine what  men  them  doing presently  great jet  white smoke burst   ferryboat’s side    expanded  rose   lazy cloud  same dull throb  sound  borne   listeners again “i know now” exclaimed tom “somebody’s drownded” “that’s it” said huck “they done  last summer when bill turner got drownded they shoot  cannon over  water   makes him come up   top yes  they take loaves  bread  put quicksilver  ’em  set ’em afloat  wherever there’s anybody that’s drownded they’ll float right there  stop” “yes i’ve heard about that” said joe “i wonder what makes  bread do that” “oh  ain’t  bread so much” said tom “i reckon it’s mostly what they say over  before they start  out” “but they don’t say anything over it” said huck “i’ve seen ’em  they don’t” “well that’s funny” said tom “but maybe they say   themselves of course they do anybody might know that” the other boys agreed  there  reason  what tom said because  ignorant lump  bread uninstructed   incantation could not  expected  act very intelligently when set upon  errand  such gravity “by jings i wish i  over there now” said joe “i do too” said huck “i’d give heaps  know who  is” the boys still listened  watched presently  revealing thought flashed through tom’s mind   exclaimed “boys i know who’s drownded—it’s us” they felt like heroes   instant here   gorgeous triumph they  missed they  mourned hearts  breaking  their account tears  being shed accusing memories  unkindness  these poor lost lads  rising up  unavailing regrets  remorse  being indulged  best  all  departed   talk   whole town   envy  all  boys  far  this dazzling notoriety  concerned this  fine it  worth while    pirate after all as twilight drew on  ferryboat went back  her accustomed business   skiffs disappeared the pirates returned  camp they  jubilant  vanity over their new grandeur   illustrious trouble they  making they caught fish cooked supper  ate it  then fell  guessing  what  village  thinking  saying about them   pictures they drew   public distress  their account  gratifying  look upon—from their point  view but when  shadows  night closed them in they gradually ceased  talk  sat gazing into  fire  their minds evidently wandering elsewhere the excitement  gone now  tom  joe could not keep back thoughts  certain persons  home who  not enjoying this fine frolic  much  they were misgivings came they grew troubled  unhappy  sigh or two escaped unawares by   joe timidly ventured upon  roundabout “feeler”   how  others might look upon  return  civilization—not right now but— tom withered him  derision huck being uncommitted  yet joined   tom   waverer quickly “explained”   glad  get out   scrape   little taint  chickenhearted homesickness clinging  his garments   could mutiny  effectually laid  rest   moment as  night deepened huck began  nod  presently  snore joe followed next tom lay upon his elbow motionless  some time watching  two intently at last  got up cautiously  his knees  went searching among  grass   flickering reflections flung   campfire he picked up  inspected several large semicylinders   thin white bark   sycamore  finally chose two which seemed  suit him then  knelt   fire  painfully wrote something upon each  these  his “red keel” one  rolled up  put  his jacket pocket   other  put  joe’s hat  removed    little distance   owner and  also put into  hat certain schoolboy treasures  almost inestimable value—among them  lump  chalk  indiarubber ball three fishhooks  one   kind  marbles known   “sure ’nough crystal” then  tiptoed his way cautiously among  trees till  felt    out  hearing  straightway broke into  keen run   direction   sandbar chapter xv a few minutes later tom    shoal water   bar wading toward  illinois shore before  depth reached his middle   halfway over  current would permit no more wading now so  struck out confidently  swim  remaining hundred yards he swam quartering upstream but still  swept downward rather faster than  had expected however  reached  shore finally  drifted along till  found  low place  drew himself out he put his hand  his jacket pocket found his piece  bark safe  then struck through  woods following  shore  streaming garments shortly before ten o’clock  came out into  open place opposite  village  saw  ferryboat lying   shadow   trees   high bank everything  quiet under  blinking stars he crept down  bank watching  all his eyes slipped into  water swam three or four strokes  climbed into  skiff  did “yawl” duty   boat’s stern he laid himself down under  thwarts  waited panting presently  cracked bell tapped   voice gave  order  “cast off” a minute or two later  skiff’s head  standing high up against  boat’s swell   voyage  begun tom felt happy  his success   knew    boat’s last trip   night at  end   long twelve or fifteen minutes  wheels stopped  tom slipped overboard  swam ashore   dusk landing fifty yards downstream out  danger  possible stragglers he flew along unfrequented alleys  shortly found himself  his aunt’s back fence he climbed over approached  “ell”  looked    sittingroom window   light  burning there there sat aunt polly sid mary  joe harper’s mother grouped together talking they    bed   bed  between them   door tom went   door  began  softly lift  latch then  pressed gently   door yielded  crack  continued pushing cautiously  quaking every time  creaked till  judged  might squeeze through  his knees so  put his head through  began warily “what makes  candle blow so” said aunt polly tom hurried up “why  door’s open i believe why  course  is no end  strange things now go ’long  shut it sid” tom disappeared under  bed just  time he lay  “breathed” himself   time  then crept  where  could almost touch his aunt’s foot “but  i  saying” said aunt polly “he warn’t bad so  say—only mischeevous only just giddy  harumscarum you know he warn’t any more responsible than  colt he never meant any harm     besthearted boy  ever was”—and she began  cry “it  just so  my joe—always full  his devilment  up  every kind  mischief but   just  unselfish  kind   could be—and laws bless me  think i went  whipped him  taking  cream never once recollecting  i throwed  out myself because   sour  i never  see him again  this world never never never poor abused boy” and mrs harper sobbed  if her heart would break “i hope tom’s better off where  is” said sid “but if he’d been better  some ways—” “sid” tom felt  glare   old lady’s eye though  could not see it “not  word against my tom now  he’s gone god’ll take care  him—never you trouble yourself sir oh mrs harper i don’t know how  give him up i don’t know how  give him up he  such  comfort  me although  tormented my old heart out  me ’most” “the lord giveth   lord hath taken away—blessed   name   lord but it’s so hard—oh it’s so hard only last saturday my joe busted  firecracker right under my nose  i knocked him sprawling little did i know then how soon—oh if    do over again i’d hug him  bless him  it” “yes yes yes i know just how you feel mrs harper i know just exactly how you feel no longer ago than yesterday noon my tom took  filled  cat full  painkiller  i did think  cretur would tear  house down and god forgive me i cracked tom’s head  my thimble poor boy poor dead boy but he’s out  all his troubles now and  last words i ever heard him say   reproach—” but this memory  too much   old lady  she broke entirely down tom  snuffling now himself—and more  pity  himself than anybody else he could hear mary crying  putting   kindly word  him  time  time he began  have  nobler opinion  himself than ever before still   sufficiently touched  his aunt’s grief  long  rush out  under  bed  overwhelm her  joy—and  theatrical gorgeousness   thing appealed strongly  his nature too but  resisted  lay still he went  listening  gathered  odds  ends    conjectured  first   boys had got drowned while taking  swim then  small raft had been missed next certain boys said  missing lads had promised   village should “hear something” soon  wiseheads had “put this   together”  decided   lads had gone off   raft  would turn up   next town below presently but toward noon  raft had been found lodged against  missouri shore some five or six miles below  village—and then hope perished they must  drowned else hunger would have driven them home  nightfall if not sooner it  believed   search   bodies had been  fruitless effort merely because  drowning must have occurred  midchannel since  boys being good swimmers would otherwise have escaped  shore this  wednesday night if  bodies continued missing until sunday all hope would  given over   funerals would  preached   morning tom shuddered mrs harper gave  sobbing goodnight  turned  go then   mutual impulse  two bereaved women flung themselves into each other’s arms  had  good consoling cry  then parted aunt polly  tender far beyond her wont  her goodnight  sid  mary sid snuffled  bit  mary went off crying  all her heart aunt polly knelt down  prayed  tom so touchingly so appealingly   such measureless love  her words  her old trembling voice    weltering  tears again long before she  through he had  keep still long after she went  bed  she kept making brokenhearted ejaculations  time  time tossing unrestfully  turning over but  last she  still only moaning  little  her sleep now  boy stole out rose gradually   bedside shaded  candlelight  his hand  stood regarding her his heart  full  pity  her he took out his sycamore scroll  placed    candle but something occurred  him   lingered considering his face lighted   happy solution  his thought  put  bark hastily  his pocket then  bent over  kissed  faded lips  straightway made his stealthy exit latching  door behind him he threaded his way back   ferry landing found nobody  large there  walked boldly  board  boat   knew she  tenantless except  there   watchman who always turned   slept like  graven image he untied  skiff   stern slipped into it   soon rowing cautiously upstream when  had pulled  mile above  village  started quartering across  bent himself stoutly  his work he hit  landing   other side neatly  this   familiar bit  work  him he  moved  capture  skiff arguing   might  considered  ship  therefore legitimate prey   pirate but  knew  thorough search would  made     might end  revelations so  stepped ashore  entered  woods he sat down  took  long rest torturing himself meanwhile  keep awake  then started warily down  homestretch the night  far spent it  broad daylight before  found himself fairly abreast  island bar he rested again until  sun  well up  gilding  great river   splendor  then  plunged into  stream a little later  paused dripping upon  threshold   camp  heard joe say “no tom’s trueblue huck  he’ll come back he won’t desert he knows  would   disgrace   pirate  tom’s too proud   sort  thing he’s up  something or other now i wonder what” “well  things  ours anyway ain’t they” “pretty near but not yet huck the writing says they  if  ain’t back here  breakfast” “which  is” exclaimed tom  fine dramatic effect stepping grandly into camp a sumptuous breakfast  bacon  fish  shortly provided    boys set  work upon it tom recounted and adorned his adventures they   vain  boastful company  heroes when  tale  done then tom hid himself away   shady nook  sleep till noon   other pirates got ready  fish  explore chapter xvi after dinner all  gang turned out  hunt  turtle eggs   bar they went about poking sticks into  sand  when they found  soft place they went down  their knees  dug  their hands sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out  one hole they  perfectly round white things  trifle smaller than  english walnut they had  famous friedegg feast  night  another  friday morning after breakfast they went whooping  prancing out   bar  chased each other round  round shedding clothes  they went until they  naked  then continued  frolic far away up  shoal water   bar against  stiff current which latter tripped their legs  under them  time  time  greatly increased  fun and now  then they stooped   group  splashed water  each other’s faces  their palms gradually approaching each other  averted faces  avoid  strangling sprays  finally gripping  struggling till  best man ducked his neighbor  then they all went under   tangle  white legs  arms  came up blowing sputtering laughing  gasping  breath  one   same time when they  well exhausted they would run out  sprawl   dry hot sand  lie there  cover themselves up  it     break   water again  go through  original performance once more finally  occurred  them  their naked skin represented fleshcolored “tights” very fairly so they drew  ring   sand  had  circus—with three clowns  it  none would yield this proudest post  his neighbor next they got their marbles  played “knucks”  “ringtaw”  “keeps” till  amusement grew stale then joe  huck had another swim but tom would not venture because  found   kicking off his trousers  had kicked his string  rattlesnake rattles off his ankle   wondered how  had escaped cramp so long without  protection  this mysterious charm he did not venture again until  had found it    time  other boys  tired  ready  rest they gradually wandered apart dropped into  “dumps”  fell  gazing longingly across  wide river  where  village lay drowsing   sun tom found himself writing “becky”   sand  his big toe  scratched  out   angry  himself  his weakness but  wrote  again nevertheless  could not help it he erased  once more  then took himself out  temptation  driving  other boys together  joining them but joe’s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection he  so homesick   could hardly endure  misery  it the tears lay very near  surface huck  melancholy too tom  downhearted but tried hard not  show it he had  secret which   not ready  tell yet but if this mutinous depression  not broken up soon  would have  bring  out he said   great show  cheerfulness “i bet there’s been pirates  this island before boys we’ll explore  again they’ve hid treasures here somewhere how’d you feel  light   rotten chest full  gold  silver—hey” but  roused only faint enthusiasm which faded out  no reply tom tried one or two other seductions but they failed too it  discouraging work joe sat poking up  sand   stick  looking very gloomy finally  said “oh boys let’s give  up i want  go home it’s so lonesome” “oh no joe you’ll feel better   by” said tom “just think   fishing that’s here” “i don’t care  fishing i want  go home” “but joe there ain’t such another swimmingplace anywhere” “swimming’s no good i don’t seem  care  it somehow when there ain’t anybody  say i sha’n’t go in i mean  go home” “oh shucks baby you want  see your mother i reckon” “yes i do want  see my mother—and you would too if you had one i ain’t any more baby than you are” and joe snuffled  little “well we’ll let  crybaby go home  his mother won’t we huck poor thing—does  want  see  mother and so  shall you like  here don’t you huck we’ll stay won’t we” huck said “yes”—without any heart  it “i’ll never speak  you again  long  i live” said joe rising “there now” and  moved moodily away  began  dress himself “who cares” said tom “nobody wants you to go ’long home  get laughed at oh you’re  nice pirate huck  me ain’t crybabies we’ll stay won’t we huck let him go if  wants to i reckon we can get along without him per’aps” but tom  uneasy nevertheless   alarmed  see joe go sullenly   his dressing and then   discomforting  see huck eying joe’s preparations so wistfully  keeping up such  ominous silence presently without  parting word joe began  wade off toward  illinois shore tom’s heart began  sink he glanced  huck huck could not bear  look  dropped his eyes then  said “i want  go too tom it  getting so lonesome anyway  now it’ll  worse let’s us go too tom” “i won’t you can all go if you want to i mean  stay” “tom i better go” “well go ’long—who’s hendering you” huck began  pick up his scattered clothes he said “tom i wisht you’d come too now you think  over we’ll wait  you when we get  shore” “well you’ll wait  blame long time that’s all” huck started sorrowfully away  tom stood looking after him   strong desire tugging  his heart  yield his pride  go along too he hoped  boys would stop but they still waded slowly on it suddenly dawned  tom    become very lonely  still he made one final struggle  his pride  then darted after his comrades yelling “wait wait i want  tell you something” they presently stopped  turned around when  got  where they were  began unfolding his secret  they listened moodily till  last they saw  “point”   driving at  then they set up  warwhoop  applause  said   “splendid”  said if  had told them  first they wouldn’t have started away he made  plausible excuse but his real reason had been  fear  not even  secret would keep them  him any very great length  time  so  had meant  hold   reserve   last seduction the lads came gayly back  went  their sports again   will chattering all  time about tom’s stupendous plan  admiring  genius  it after  dainty egg  fish dinner tom said  wanted  learn  smoke now joe caught   idea  said  would like  try too so huck made pipes  filled them these novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made  grapevine  they “bit”  tongue   not considered manly anyway now they stretched themselves out  their elbows  began  puff charily   slender confidence the smoke had  unpleasant taste  they gagged  little but tom said “why it’s just  easy if i’d  knowed this  all i’d  learnt long ago” “so would i” said joe “it’s just nothing” “why many  time i’ve looked  people smoking  thought well i wish i could do that but i never thought i could” said tom “that’s just  way  me hain’t it huck you’ve heard me talk just  way—haven’t you huck i’ll leave   huck if i haven’t” “yes—heaps  times” said huck “well i have too” said tom “oh hundreds  times once down   slaughterhouse don’t you remember huck bob tanner  there  johnny miller  jeff thatcher when i said it don’t you remember huck ’bout me saying that” “yes that’s so” said huck “that   day after i lost  white alley no ’twas  day before” “there—i told you so” said tom “huck recollects it” “i bleeve i could smoke this pipe all day” said joe “i don’t feel sick” “neither do i” said tom “i could smoke  all day but i bet you jeff thatcher couldn’t” “jeff thatcher why he’d keel over just  two draws just let him try  once he’d see” “i bet  would and johnny miller—i wish could see johnny miller tackle  once” “oh don’t i” said joe “why i bet you johnny miller couldn’t any more do this than nothing just one little snifter would fetch him” “’deed  would joe say—i wish  boys could see us now” “so do i” “say—boys don’t say anything about it  some time when they’re around i’ll come up  you  say ‘joe got  pipe i want  smoke’ and you’ll say kind  careless like  if  warn’t anything you’ll say ‘yes i got my old pipe  another one but my tobacker ain’t very good’ and i’ll say ‘oh that’s all right if it’s strong enough’ and then you’ll out   pipes  we’ll light up just  ca’m  then just see ’em look” “by jings that’ll  gay tom i wish   now” “so do i and when we tell ’em we learned when we  off pirating won’t they wish they’d been along” “oh i reckon not i’ll just bet they will” so  talk ran on but presently  began  flag  trifle  grow disjointed the silences widened  expectoration marvellously increased every pore inside  boys’ cheeks became  spouting fountain they could scarcely bail out  cellars under their tongues fast enough  prevent  inundation little overflowings down their throats occurred  spite  all they could do  sudden retchings followed every time both boys  looking very pale  miserable now joe’s pipe dropped  his nerveless fingers tom’s followed both fountains  going furiously  both pumps bailing  might  main joe said feebly “i’ve lost my knife i reckon i better go  find it” tom said  quivering lips  halting utterance “i’ll help you you go over  way  i’ll hunt around   spring no you needn’t come huck—we can find it” so huck sat down again  waited  hour then  found  lonesome  went  find his comrades they  wide apart   woods both very pale both fast asleep but something informed him  if they had had any trouble they had got rid  it they  not talkative  supper  night they had  humble look  when huck prepared his pipe after  meal   going  prepare theirs they said no they  not feeling very well—something they ate  dinner had disagreed  them about midnight joe awoke  called  boys there   brooding oppressiveness   air  seemed  bode something the boys huddled themselves together  sought  friendly companionship   fire though  dull dead heat   breathless atmosphere  stifling they sat still intent  waiting the solemn hush continued beyond  light   fire everything  swallowed up   blackness  darkness presently there came  quivering glow  vaguely revealed  foliage   moment  then vanished by   another came  little stronger then another then  faint moan came sighing through  branches   forest   boys felt  fleeting breath upon their cheeks  shuddered   fancy   spirit   night had gone by there   pause now  weird flash turned night into day  showed every little grassblade separate  distinct  grew about their feet and  showed three white startled faces too a deep peal  thunder went rolling  tumbling down  heavens  lost itself  sullen rumblings   distance a sweep  chilly air passed by rustling all  leaves  snowing  flaky ashes broadcast about  fire another fierce glare lit up  forest   instant crash followed  seemed  rend  treetops right over  boys’ heads they clung together  terror   thick gloom  followed a few big raindrops fell pattering upon  leaves “quick boys go   tent” exclaimed tom they sprang away stumbling over roots  among vines   dark no two plunging   same direction a furious blast roared through  trees making everything sing   went one blinding flash after another came  peal  peal  deafening thunder and now  drenching rain poured down   rising hurricane drove   sheets along  ground the boys cried out  each other but  roaring wind   booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly however one  one they straggled   last  took shelter under  tent cold scared  streaming  water but  have company  misery seemed something   grateful for they could not talk  old sail flapped so furiously even if  other noises would have allowed them the tempest rose higher  higher  presently  sail tore loose   fastenings  went winging away   blast the boys seized each others’ hands  fled  many tumblings  bruises   shelter   great oak  stood upon  riverbank now  battle    highest under  ceaseless conflagration  lightning  flamed   skies everything below stood out  cleancut  shadowless distinctness  bending trees  billowy river white  foam  driving spray  spumeflakes  dim outlines   high bluffs   other side glimpsed through  drifting cloudrack   slanting veil  rain every little while some giant tree yielded  fight  fell

weaker threatenings  grumblings  peace resumed her sway the boys went back  camp  good deal awed but they found there  still something   thankful for because  great sycamore  shelter  their beds

morning  there  not  dry spot  sleep on anywhere around as  sun began  steal  upon  boys drowsiness came over them  they went out   sandbar  lay down  sleep they got scorched out   by  drearily set about getting breakfast after  meal they felt rusty  stiffjointed   little homesick once more tom saw  signs  fell  cheering up  pirates  well   could but they cared nothing  marbles or circus or swimming or anything he reminded them   imposing secret  raised  ray  cheer while  lasted  got them interested   new device this   knock off being pirates   while   indians   change they  attracted  this idea so   not long before they  stripped  striped  head  heel  black mud like so many zebras—all  them chiefs  course—and then they went tearing through  woods  attack  english settlement by

assembled  camp toward suppertime hungry  happy but now  difficulty arose—hostile indians could not break  bread  hospitality together without first making peace  this   simple impossibility without smoking  pipe  peace there  no other process  ever they had heard of two   savages almost wished they had remained pirates however there  no other way so  such show  cheerfulness  they could muster they called   pipe  took their whiff   passed  due form and behold they  glad they had gone into savagery  they had gained something they found  they could now smoke  little without having  go  hunt   lost knife they did not get sick enough   seriously uncomfortable they  not likely  fool away this high promise  lack  effort no they practised cautiously after supper  right fair success  so they spent  jubilant evening they  prouder  happier  their new acquirement than they would have been   scalping  skinning   six nations we  leave them  smoke  chatter  brag since we have no further use

possessed  village although   ordinarily quiet enough  all conscience the villagers conducted their concerns   absent air  talked little but they sighed often the saturday holiday seemed  burden   children they had no heart  their sports  gradually gave them up in  afternoon becky thatcher found herself moping about  deserted schoolhouse yard  feeling very melancholy but she found nothing there  comfort her she soliloquized “oh if i only had  brass andironknob again but i haven’t got anything now  remember him by” and she choked back  little sob presently she stopped  said  herself “it  right here oh if    do over again i wouldn’t say that—i wouldn’t say    whole world but he’s gone now i’ll never never never see him any more” this thought broke her down  she wandered away  tears rolling down her cheeks then quite  group  boys  girls—playmates  tom’s  joe’s—came by  stood looking over  paling fence  talking  reverent tones  how tom did soandso  last time they saw him  how joe said this   small trifle pregnant  awful prophecy  they could easily see now—and each speaker pointed out  exact spot where  lost lads stood   time  then added something like “and i  astanding just so—just  i am now   if you  him—i   close  that—and  smiled just this way—and then something seemed  go all over me like—awful you know—and i never thought what  meant  course but i can see now” then there   dispute about who saw  dead boys last  life  many claimed  dismal distinction  offered evidences more or less tampered    witness  when   ultimately decided who did see  departed last  exchanged  last words  them  lucky parties took upon themselves  sort  sacred importance   gaped   envied  all  rest one poor chap who had no other grandeur  offer said  tolerably manifest pride   remembrance “well tom sawyer  licked me once” but  bid  glory   failure most   boys could say that  so  cheapened  distinction too much the group loitered away still recalling memories   lost heroes  awed voices when  sundayschool hour  finished  next morning  bell began  toll instead  ringing   usual way it   very still sabbath   mournful sound seemed  keeping   musing hush  lay upon nature the villagers began  gather loitering  moment   vestibule  converse  whispers about  sad event but there  no whispering   house only  funereal rustling  dresses   women gathered  their seats disturbed  silence there none could remember when  little church had been so full before there  finally  waiting pause  expectant dumbness  then aunt polly entered followed  sid  mary  they   harper family all  deep black   whole congregation  old minister  well rose reverently  stood until  mourners  seated   front pew there  another communing silence broken  intervals  muffled sobs  then  minister spread his hands abroad  prayed a moving hymn  sung   text followed “i am  resurrection   life” as  service proceeded  clergyman drew such pictures   graces  winning ways   rare promise   lost lads  every soul there thinking  recognized these pictures felt  pang  remembering   had persistently blinded himself  them always before  had  persistently seen only faults  flaws   poor boys the minister

slink away but tom seized him  said “aunt polly  ain’t fair somebody’s got   glad  see huck” “and so they shall i’m glad  see him poor motherless thing” and  loving attentions aunt polly lavished upon him   one thing capable  making him more uncomfortable than   before suddenly  minister shouted   top  his voice “praise god  whom all blessings flow—sing—and put your hearts  it” and they did old

talk in  course   aunt polly said “well i don’t say  wasn’t  fine joke tom  keep everybody suffering ’most  week so you boys had  good time but    pity you could  so hardhearted   let me suffer so if you could come over   log  go  your funeral you could have come over  give me  hint some way  you warn’t dead but only run off” “yes you could have done that tom” said mary “and i believe you would if you had thought  it” “would you tom” said aunt polly her face lighting wistfully “say now would you if you’d thought  it” “i—well i don’t know ’twould ’a’ spoiled everything” “tom i hoped you loved me  much” said aunt polly   grieved tone  discomforted  boy “it would have been something if you’d cared enough  think  it even if you didn’t do it” “now auntie  ain’t any harm” pleaded mary “it’s only tom’s giddy way—he  always  such  rush   never thinks  anything” “more’s  pity sid would have thought and sid would have come  done it too tom you’ll look back some day when it’s too late  wish you’d cared  little more  me when  would have cost you so little” “now auntie you know i do care  you” said tom “i’d know  better if you acted more like it” “i wish now i’d thought” said tom   repentant tone “but i dreamt about you anyway that’s something ain’t it” “it ain’t much—a cat does  much—but it’s better than nothing what did you dream” “why wednesday night i dreamt  you  sitting over there

i did so i did not  first time neither and then—” “then mrs harper she began  cry  said joe  just  same  she wished she hadn’t whipped him  taking cream when she’d throwed  out her own self—” “tom the sperrit  upon you you   prophesying—that’s what you  doing land alive go on tom” “then sid  said—he said—” “i don’t think i said anything” said sid “yes you did sid” said mary “shut your heads  let

children left  school   old lady  call  mrs harper  vanquish her realism  tom’s marvellous dream sid had better judgment than  utter  thought    his mind   left  house it  this “pretty thin—as long  dream  that without any mistakes  it” what  hero tom  become now he did not go skipping  prancing but moved   dignified swagger  became  pirate who felt   public eye   him and indeed  was  tried not

 his  his glittering notoriety  tom would not have parted  either   circus at school  children made so much  him   joe  delivered such eloquent admiration  their eyes   two heroes  not long  becoming insufferably “stuckup” they began  tell their adventures  hungry listeners—but they only began   not  thing likely  have  end  imaginations like theirs  furnish material and finally when they got out their pipes  went serenely puffing around  very summit  glory  reached tom decided   could  independent  becky thatcher now glory  sufficient he would live  glory now    distinguished maybe she would  wanting  “make up” well let her—she should see   could   indifferent  some other people presently she arrived tom pretended not  see her he moved away  joined  group  boys  girls  began  talk soon  observed  she  tripping gayly back  forth  flushed face  dancing eyes pretending   busy chasing schoolmates  screaming  laughter when she made  capture but  noticed  she always made her captures  his vicinity   she seemed  cast  conscious eye  his direction  such times too it gratified all  vicious vanity    him  so instead  winning him  only “set him up”  more  made him  more diligent  avoid betraying   knew she  about presently she gave over skylarking  moved irresolutely about sighing once or twice  glancing furtively  wistfully toward tom then she observed  now tom  talking more particularly  amy lawrence than  any one else she felt  sharp pang  grew disturbed  uneasy  once she tried  go away but her feet  treacherous  carried her   group instead she said   girl almost  tom’s elbow—with sham vivacity “why mary austin you bad girl why didn’t you come  sundayschool” “i did come—didn’t you see me” “why no did you where did you sit” “i   miss peters’ class where i always go i

while   “standing within three feet  it” “oh may i come” said grace miller “yes” “and me” said sally rogers “yes” “and me too” said susy harper “and joe” “yes” and so on  clapping  joyful hands till all  group had begged  invitations but tom  amy then tom turned coolly away still talking  took amy  him becky’s lips trembled   tears came  her eyes she hid these signs   forced gayety  went  chattering but  life had gone out   picnic now  out  everything else she got away  soon  she could  hid herself  had what her sex call “a good cry” then she sat moody  wounded pride till  bell rang she roused up now   vindictive cast  her eye  gave her plaited tails  shake  said she knew what she’d do at recess tom continued his flirtation  amy  jubilant selfsatisfaction and  kept drifting about  find becky  lacerate her   performance at last  spied her but there   sudden falling  his mercury she  sitting cosily   little bench behind  schoolhouse looking   picturebook  alfred temple—and so absorbed  they  their heads so close together over  book  they did not seem   conscious  anything   world besides jealousy ran redhot through tom’s veins he began  hate himself  throwing away  chance becky had offered   reconciliation he called himself  fool  all  hard names  could think of he wanted  cry  vexation amy chatted happily along  they walked  her heart  singing but tom’s tongue had lost  function he did not hear what amy  saying  whenever she paused expectantly  could only stammer  awkward assent which   often misplaced  otherwise he kept drifting   rear   schoolhouse again  again  sear his eyeballs   hateful spectacle there he could not help it and  maddened him  see   thought  saw  becky thatcher never once suspected    even   land   living but she did see nevertheless  she knew she  winning her fight too   glad  see him suffer  she had suffered amy’s happy prattle became intolerable tom hinted  things  had  attend to things  must  done  time  fleeting but  vain—the girl chirped on tom thought “oh hang her ain’t i ever going  get rid  her” at last  must  attending  those things—and she said artlessly  she would  “around” when school let out and  hastened away hating her  it “any other boy” tom thought grating his teeth “any boy   whole town but  saint louis smarty  thinks  dresses so fine   aristocracy oh all right i licked you  first day you ever saw this town mister  i’ll lick you again you just wait till i catch you out i’ll just take and—” and  went through  motions  thrashing  imaginary boy—pummelling  air  kicking  gouging “oh you do do you you holler ’nough do you now then let  learn you” and so  imaginary flogging  finished  his satisfaction tom fled home  noon his conscience could not endure any more  amy’s grateful happiness  his jealousy could bear no more   other distress becky resumed her picture inspections  alfred but   minutes dragged along  no tom came  suffer her triumph began  cloud  she lost interest gravity  absentmindedness followed  then melancholy two or three times she pricked up her ear   footstep but    false hope no tom came at last she grew entirely miserable  wished she hadn’t carried  so far when poor alfred seeing    losing her  did not know how kept exclaiming “oh here’s  jolly one look  this” she lost patience  last  said “oh don’t bother me i don’t care  them”  burst into tears  got up  walked away alfred dropped alongside   going  try  comfort her but she said “go away  leave me alone can’t you i hate you” so  boy halted wondering what  could have done—for she had said she would look  pictures all through  nooning—and she walked on crying then alfred went musing into  deserted schoolhouse he  humiliated  angry he easily guessed his way   truth—the girl had simply made  convenience  him  vent her spite upon tom sawyer he  far  hating tom  less when this thought occurred  him he wished there  some way  get  boy into trouble without much risk  himself tom’s spellingbook fell under his eye here  his opportunity he gratefully opened   lesson   afternoon  poured ink upon  page becky glancing    window behind him   moment saw  act  moved on without discovering herself she started homeward now intending  find tom  tell him tom would  thankful  their troubles would  healed before she  half way home however she had changed her mind the thought  tom’s treatment  her when she  talking about her picnic came scorching back  filled her  shame she resolved  let him get whipped   damaged spellingbook’s account   hate him forever into  bargain chapter xix tom arrived  home   dreary mood   first thing his aunt said  him showed him   had brought his sorrows   unpromising market “tom i’ve  notion  skin you alive” “auntie what have i done” “well you’ve done enough here i go over  sereny harper like  old softy expecting i’m going  make her believe all  rubbage about  dream when lo  behold you she’d found out  joe  you  over here  heard all  talk we had  night tom i don’t know what   become   boy   act like that it makes me feel so bad  think you could let me go  sereny harper  make such  fool  myself  never say  word” this   new aspect   thing his smartness   morning had seemed  tom  good joke before  very ingenious it merely looked mean  shabby now he hung his head  could not think  anything  say   moment then  said “auntie i wish i hadn’t done it—but i didn’t think” “oh child you never think you never think  anything but your own selfishness you could think  come all  way over here  jackson’s island   night  laugh  our troubles  you could think  fool me   lie about  dream but you couldn’t ever think  pity us  save us  sorrow” “auntie i know now   mean but i didn’t mean   mean i didn’t honest and besides i didn’t come over here  laugh  you  night” “what did you come for then” “it   tell you not   uneasy about us because we hadn’t got drownded” “tom tom i would   thankfullest soul  this world if i could believe you ever had  good  thought  that but you know you never did—and i know it tom” “indeed  ’deed i did auntie—i wish i may never stir if i didn’t” “oh tom don’t lie—don’t do it it only makes things  hundred times worse” “it ain’t  lie auntie it’s  truth i wanted  keep you  grieving—that  all  made me come” “i’d give  whole world  believe that—it would cover up  power  sins tom i’d ’most  glad you’d run off  acted so bad but  ain’t reasonable because why didn’t you tell me child” “why you see when you got  talking about  funeral i just got all full   idea  our coming  hiding   church  i couldn’t somehow bear  spoil it so i just put  bark back  my pocket  kept mum” “what bark” “the bark i had wrote   tell you we’d gone pirating i wish now you’d waked up when i kissed you—i do honest” the hard lines  his aunt’s face relaxed   sudden tenderness dawned  her eyes “did you kiss me tom” “why yes i did” “are you sure you did tom” “why yes i did auntie—certain sure” “what did you kiss me for tom” “because i loved you so  you laid there moaning  i  so sorry” the words sounded like truth the old lady could not hide  tremor  her voice when she said “kiss me again tom—and  off  you  school now  don’t bother me any more” the moment   gone she ran   closet  got out  ruin   jacket which tom had gone pirating in then she stopped    her hand  said  herself “no i don’t dare poor boy i reckon he’s lied about it—but it’s  blessed blessed lie there’s such  comfort come  it i hope  lord—i know  lord  forgive him because   such goodheartedness  him  tell it but i don’t want  find out it’s  lie i won’t look” she put  jacket away  stood  musing  minute twice she put out her hand  take  garment again  twice she refrained once more she ventured  this time she fortified herself   thought “it’s  good lie—it’s  good lie—i won’t let  grieve me” so she sought  jacket pocket a moment later she  reading tom’s piece  bark through flowing tears  saying “i could forgive  boy now if he’d committed  million sins” chapter xx there  something about aunt polly’s manner when she kissed tom  swept away his low spirits  made him lighthearted  happy again he started  school  had  luck  coming upon becky thatcher   head  meadow lane his mood always determined his manner without  moment’s hesitation  ran  her  said “i acted mighty mean today becky  i’m so sorry i won’t ever ever do  way again  long  ever i live—please make up won’t you” the girl stopped  looked him scornfully   face “i’ll thank you  keep yourself to yourself mr thomas sawyer i’ll never speak  you again” she tossed her head  passed on tom  so stunned   had not even presence  mind enough  say “who cares miss smarty” until  right time  say  had gone by so  said nothing but     fine rage nevertheless he moped into  schoolyard wishing she   boy  imagining how  would trounce her if she were he presently encountered her  delivered  stinging remark   passed she hurled one  return   angry breach  complete it seemed  becky  her hot resentment  she could hardly wait  school  “take in” she  so impatient  see tom flogged   injured spellingbook if she had had any lingering notion  exposing alfred temple tom’s offensive fling had driven  entirely away poor girl she did not know how fast she  nearing trouble herself the master mr dobbins had reached middle age   unsatisfied ambition the darling  his desires was    doctor but poverty had decreed   should  nothing higher than  village schoolmaster every day  took  mysterious book out  his desk  absorbed himself    times when no classes  reciting he kept  book under lock  key there  not  urchin  school but  perishing  have  glimpse  it but  chance never came every boy  girl had  theory about  nature   book but no two theories  alike  there  no

at  moment  shadow fell   page  tom sawyer stepped    door  caught  glimpse   picture becky snatched   book  close it  had  hard luck  tear  pictured page half down  middle she thrust  volume into  desk turned  key  burst out crying  shame  vexation “tom sawyer you  just  mean  you can be  sneak up   person  look  what they’re looking at” “how could i know you  looking  anything” “you ought   ashamed  yourself tom sawyer you know you’re going  tell  me  oh what shall i do what shall i do i’ll  whipped  i never  whipped  school” then she stamped her little foot  said “be so mean if you want to i know something that’s going  happen you just wait  you’ll see hateful hateful hateful”—and she flung out   house   new explosion  crying tom stood still rather flustered  this onslaught presently  said  himself “what  curious kind   fool  girl is never been licked  school shucks what’s  licking that’s just like  girl—they’re so thinskinned  chickenhearted well  course i ain’t going  tell old dobbins  this little fool because there’s other ways  getting even  her  ain’t so mean but what  it old dobbins  ask who   tore his book nobody’ll answer then he’ll do just  way  always does—ask first

because there ain’t any way out  it” tom conned  thing  moment longer  then added “all right though she’d like  see me  just such  fix—let her sweat  out” tom joined  mob  skylarking scholars outside in  few moments  master arrived  school “took in” tom did not feel  strong interest  his studies every time  stole  glance   girls’ side   room becky’s face troubled him considering all things  did not want  pity her  yet   all  could do  help it he could get up no exultation   really worthy  name presently  spellingbook discovery  made  tom’s mind  entirely full  his own matters   while after

stillness continued  master searched face after face  signs  guilt “benjamin rogers did you tear this book” a denial another pause “joseph harper did you” another denial tom’s uneasiness grew more  more intense under  slow torture  these proceedings the master scanned  ranks  boys—considered  while then turned   girls “amy lawrence” a shake   head “gracie miller” the same sign “susan harper did

quaked under him    like  choke true  had  manifest sympathy   house but  had  house’s silence too which  even worse than  sympathy the master frowned  this completed  disaster tom struggled awhile  then retired utterly defeated there   weak attempt  applause but  died early “the boy stood   burning deck” followed also “the assyrian came down”  other declamatory gems then there  reading exercises

this homely truth  unpalatable let us return   “examination” the first composition   read  one entitled “is this then life” perhaps  reader can endure  extract  it “in  common walks  life  what

  lonely place  have  talk  him it would  some relief  unseal his tongue   little while  divide his burden  distress  another sufferer moreover  wanted  assure himself  huck had remained discreet “huck have you ever told anybody about—that” “’bout what” “you know what” “oh—’course i haven’t” “never  word” “never  solitary word so help me what makes you ask” “well i  afeard” “why tom sawyer we wouldn’t  alive two days if  got found out you know that” tom felt more comfortable after  pause “huck they couldn’t anybody get you  tell could they” “get me  tell why if i wanted  halfbreed devil  drownd me they could get me  tell they ain’t no different way” “well that’s all right then i reckon we’re safe  long  we keep mum but let’s swear again anyway it’s more surer” “i’m agreed” so they swore again  dread solemnities “what   talk around huck i’ve heard  power  it” “talk well it’s just muff potter muff potter muff potter all  time it keeps me   sweat constant so’s i want  hide som’ers” “that’s just  same way they go  round me i reckon he’s  goner don’t you feel sorry  him sometimes” “most always—most always he ain’t no account but then  hain’t ever done anything  hurt anybody just fishes  little  get money  get drunk on—and loafs around considerable but lord we all do that—leastways most  us—preachers  such like but he’s kind  good—he give me half  fish once when there warn’t enough  two  lots  times he’s kind  stood  me when i  out  luck” “well he’s mended kites  me huck  knitted hooks   my line i wish we could get him out  there” “my we couldn’t get him out tom and besides ’twouldn’t do any good they’d ketch him again” “yes—so they would but i hate  hear ’em abuse him so like  dickens when  never done—that” “i do too tom lord i hear ’em say he’s  bloodiest looking villain  this country  they wonder  wasn’t ever hung before” “yes they talk like that all  time i’ve heard ’em say  if    get free they’d lynch him” “and they’d do it too” the boys had  long talk but  brought them little comfort as  twilight drew on they found themselves hanging about  neighborhood   little isolated jail perhaps   undefined hope  something would happen  might clear away their difficulties but nothing happened there seemed   no angels or fairies interested  this luckless captive the boys did  they had often done before—went   cell grating  gave potter some tobacco  matches he    ground floor  there  no guards his gratitude  their gifts had always smote their consciences before—it cut deeper than ever this time they felt cowardly  treacherous   last degree when potter said “you’ve been mighty good  me boys—better’n anybody else  this town and i don’t forget it i don’t often i says  myself says i ‘i used  mend all  boys’ kites  things  show ’em where  good fishin’ places was  befriend ’em what i could  now they’ve all forgot old muff when he’s  trouble but tom don’t  huck don’t—they don’t forget him says i ‘and i don’t forget them’ well boys i done  awful thing—drunk  crazy   time—that’s  only way i account  it—and now i got  swing  it  it’s right right  best too i reckon—hope so anyway well we won’t talk about that i don’t want  make you feel bad you’ve befriended me but what i want  say is don’t you ever get drunk—then you won’t ever get here stand  litter furder west—so—that’s it it’s  prime comfort  see faces that’s friendly when  body’s  such  muck  trouble  there don’t none come here but yourn good friendly faces—good friendly faces git up  one another’s backs  let me touch ’em that’s it shake hands—yourn’ll come through  bars but mine’s too big little hands  weak—but they’ve helped muff potter  power  they’d help him more if they could” tom went home miserable  his dreams  night  full  horrors the next day   day after  hung about  courtroom drawn   almost irresistible impulse  go in but forcing himself  stay out huck  having  same experience they studiously avoided each other each wandered away  time  time but  same dismal fascination always brought them back presently tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out   courtroom but invariably heard distressing news—the toils  closing more  more relentlessly around poor potter at  end   second day  village talk    effect  injun joe’s evidence stood firm  unshaken   there  not  slightest question   what  jury’s verdict would be tom  out late  night  came  bed through  window he    tremendous state  excitement it  hours before  got  sleep all  village flocked   courthouse  next morning  this     great day both sexes  about equally represented   packed audience after  long wait  jury filed   took their places shortly afterward potter pale  haggard timid  hopeless  brought in  chains upon him  seated where all  curious eyes could stare  him no less conspicuous  injun joe stolid  ever there  another pause  then  judge arrived   sheriff proclaimed  opening   court the usual whisperings among  lawyers  gathering together  papers followed these details  accompanying delays worked up  atmosphere  preparation    impressive    fascinating now  witness  called who testified   found muff potter washing   brook   early hour   morning   murder  discovered    immediately sneaked away after some further questioning counsel   prosecution said “take  witness” the prisoner raised his eyes   moment but dropped them again when his own counsel said “i have no questions  ask him” the next witness proved  finding   knife near  corpse counsel   prosecution said “take  witness” “i have no questions  ask him” potter’s lawyer replied a third witness swore  had often seen  knife  potter’s possession “take  witness” counsel  potter declined  question him the faces   audience began  betray annoyance did this attorney mean  throw away his client’s life without  effort several witnesses deposed concerning potter’s guilty behavior when brought   scene   murder they  allowed  leave  stand without being crossquestioned every detail   damaging circumstances  occurred   graveyard upon  morning which all present remembered so well  brought out  credible witnesses but none  them  crossexamined  potter’s lawyer the perplexity  dissatisfaction   house expressed itself  murmurs  provoked  reproof   bench counsel   prosecution now said “by  oaths  citizens whose simple word  above suspicion we have fastened this awful crime beyond all possibility  question upon  unhappy prisoner   bar we rest our case here” a groan escaped  poor potter   put his face  his hands  rocked his body softly   fro while  painful silence reigned   courtroom many men  moved  many women’s compassion testified itself  tears counsel   defence rose  said “your honor  our remarks   opening  this trial we foreshadowed our purpose  prove  our client did this fearful deed while under  influence   blind  irresponsible delirium produced  drink we have changed our mind we shall not offer  plea” then   clerk “call thomas sawyer” a puzzled amazement awoke  every face   house not even excepting potter’s every eye fastened itself  wondering interest upon tom   rose  took his place upon  stand the boy looked wild enough    badly scared the oath  administered “thomas sawyer where  you   seventeenth  june about  hour  midnight” tom glanced  injun joe’s iron face  his tongue failed him the audience listened breathless but  words refused  come after  few moments however  boy got  little  his strength back  managed  put enough   into his voice  make part   house hear “in  graveyard” “a little bit louder please don’t  afraid you were—” “in  graveyard” a contemptuous smile flitted across injun joe’s face “were you anywhere near horse williams’ grave” “yes sir” “speak up—just  trifle louder how near  you” “near  i am  you” “were you hidden or not” “i  hid” “where” “behind  elms that’s   edge   grave” injun joe gave  barely perceptible start “any one  you” “yes sir i went there with—” “wait—wait  moment never mind mentioning your companion’s name we  produce him   proper time did you carry anything there  you” tom hesitated  looked confused “speak out my boy—don’t  diffident the truth  always respectable what did you take there” “only a—a—dead cat” there   ripple  mirth which  court checked “we  produce  skeleton   cat now my boy tell us everything  occurred—tell   your own way—don’t skip anything  don’t  afraid” tom began—hesitatingly  first but   warmed  his subject his words flowed more  more easily   little while every sound ceased but his own voice every eye fixed itself upon him  parted lips  bated breath  audience hung upon his words taking no note  time rapt   ghastly fascinations   tale the strain upon pent emotion reached  climax when  boy said “—and   doctor fetched  board around  muff potter fell injun joe jumped   knife and—” crash quick  lightning  halfbreed sprang   window tore his way through all opposers   gone chapter xxiv tom   glittering hero once more—the pet   old  envy   young his name even went into immortal print   village paper magnified him there  some  believed  would  president yet if  escaped hanging as usual  fickle unreasoning world took muff potter   bosom  fondled him  lavishly   had abused him before but  sort  conduct    world’s credit therefore   not well  find fault  it tom’s days  days  splendor  exultation  him but his nights  seasons  horror injun joe infested all his dreams  always  doom  his eye hardly any temptation could persuade  boy  stir abroad after nightfall poor huck    same state  wretchedness  terror  tom had told  whole story   lawyer  night before  great day   trial  huck  sore afraid  his share   business might leak out yet notwithstanding injun joe’s flight had saved him  suffering  testifying  court the poor fellow had got  attorney  promise secrecy but what  that since tom’s harassed conscience had managed  drive him   lawyer’s house  night  wring  dread tale  lips  had been sealed   dismalest  most formidable  oaths huck’s confidence   human race  wellnigh obliterated daily muff potter’s gratitude made tom glad  had spoken but nightly  wished  had sealed up his tongue half  time tom  afraid injun joe would never  captured  other half   afraid  would be he felt sure  never could draw  safe breath again until  man  dead   had seen  corpse rewards had been offered  country had been scoured but no injun joe  found one  those omniscient  aweinspiring marvels  detective came up  st louis moused around shook his head looked wise  made  sort  astounding success which members   craft usually achieve that   say  “found  clew” but you can’t hang  “clew”  murder  so after  detective had got through  gone home tom felt just  insecure    before the slow days drifted on  each left behind   slightly lightened weight  apprehension chapter xxv there comes  time  every rightlyconstructed boy’s life when    raging desire  go somewhere  dig  hidden treasure this desire suddenly came upon tom one day he sallied out  find joe harper but failed  success next  sought ben rogers  had gone fishing presently  stumbled upon huck finn  redhanded huck would answer tom took him   private place  opened  matter  him confidentially huck  willing huck  always willing  take  hand  any enterprise  offered entertainment  required no capital   had  troublesome superabundance   sort  time which  not money “where’ll we dig” said huck “oh most anywhere” “why   hid all around” “no indeed  ain’t it’s hid  mighty particular places huck—sometimes  islands sometimes  rotten chests under  end   limb   old dead tree just where  shadow falls  midnight but mostly under  floor  ha’nted houses” “who hides it” “why robbers  course—who’d you reckon sundayschool sup’rintendents” “i don’t know if ’twas mine i wouldn’t hide it i’d spend   have  good time” “so would i but robbers don’t do  way they always hide   leave  there” “don’t they come after  any more” “no they think they will but they generally forget  marks or else they die anyway  lays there  long time  gets rusty     somebody finds  old yellow paper  tells how  find  marks—a paper that’s got   ciphered over about  week because it’s mostly signs  hy’roglyphics” “hyro—which” “hy’roglyphics—pictures  things you know  don’t seem  mean anything” “have you got one  them papers tom” “no” “well then how you going  find  marks” “i don’t want any marks they always bury  under  ha’nted house or   island or under  dead tree that’s got one limb sticking out well we’ve tried jackson’s island  little  we can try  again some time  there’s  old ha’nted house up  stillhouse branch  there’s lots  deadlimb trees—dead loads  ’em” “is  under all  them” “how you talk no” “then how you going  know which one  go for” “go  all  ’em” “why tom it’ll take all summer” “well what  that suppose you find  brass pot   hundred dollars  it all rusty  gray or rotten chest full  di’monds how’s that” huck’s eyes glowed “that’s bully plenty bully enough  me just you gimme  hundred dollars  i don’t want no di’monds” “all right but i bet you i ain’t going  throw off  di’monds some  ’em’s worth twenty dollars apiece—there ain’t any hardly but’s worth six bits or  dollar” “no is  so” “cert’nly—anybody’ll tell you so hain’t you ever seen one huck” “not  i remember” “oh kings have slathers  them” “well i don’ know no kings tom” “i reckon you don’t but if you   go  europe you’d see  raft  ’em hopping around” “do they hop” “hop—your granny no” “well what did you say they did for” “shucks i only meant you’d see ’em—not hopping  course—what do they want  hop for—but i mean you’d just see ’em—scattered around you know   kind   general way like  old humpbacked richard” “richard what’s his other name” “he didn’t have any other name kings don’t have any but  given name” “no” “but they don’t” “well if they like it tom all right but i don’t want    king  have only just  given name like  nigger but say—where you going  dig first” “well i don’t know s’pose we tackle  old deadlimb tree   hill t’other side  stillhouse branch” “i’m agreed” so they got  crippled pick   shovel  set out  their threemile tramp they arrived hot  panting  threw themselves down   shade   neighboring elm  rest  have  smoke “i like this” said tom “so do i” “say huck if we find  treasure here what you going  do  your share” “well i’ll have pie   glass  soda every day  i’ll go  every circus  comes along i bet i’ll have  gay time” “well ain’t you going  save any  it” “save it what for” “why so   have something  live on   by” “oh  ain’t any use pap would come back  thishyer town some day  get his claws   if i didn’t hurry up  i tell you he’d clean  out pretty quick what you going  do  yourn tom” “i’m going  buy  new drum   sure’nough sword   red necktie   bull pup  get married” “married” “that’s it” “tom you—why you ain’t  your right mind” “wait—you’ll see” “well that’s  foolishest thing you could do look  pap  my mother fight why they used  fight all  time i remember mighty well” “that ain’t anything the girl i’m going  marry won’t fight” “tom i reckon they’re all alike they’ll all comb  body now you better think ’bout this awhile i tell you you better what’s  name   gal” “it ain’t  gal  all—it’s  girl” “it’s all  same i reckon some says gal some says girl—both’s right like enough anyway what’s her name tom” “i’ll tell you some time—not now” “all right—that’ll do only if you get married i’ll  more lonesomer than ever” “no you won’t you’ll come  live  me now stir out  this  we’ll go  digging” they worked  sweated  half  hour no result they toiled another halfhour still no result huck said “do they always bury   deep  this” “sometimes—not always not generally i reckon we haven’t got  right place” so they chose  new spot  began again the labor dragged  little but still they made progress they pegged away  silence  some time finally huck leaned  his shovel swabbed  beaded drops  his brow  his sleeve  said “where you going  dig next after we get this one” “i reckon maybe we’ll tackle  old tree that’s over yonder  cardiff hill back   widow’s” “i reckon that’ll   good one but won’t  widow take  away  us tom it’s  her land” “she take  away maybe she’d like  try  once whoever finds one  these hid treasures  belongs  him it don’t make any difference whose land it’s on” that  satisfactory the work went on by   huck said “blame it we must    wrong place again what do you think” “it  mighty curious huck i don’t understand it sometimes witches interfere i reckon maybe that’s what’s  trouble now” “shucks witches ain’t got no power   daytime” “well that’s so i didn’t think  that oh i know what  matter is what  blamed lot  fools we are you got  find out where  shadow   limb falls  midnight  that’s where you dig” “then consound it we’ve fooled away all this work  nothing now hang  all we got  come back   night it’s  awful long way can you get out” “i bet i will we’ve got  do  tonight too because if somebody sees these holes they’ll know   minute what’s here  they’ll go  it” “well i’ll come around  maow tonight” “all right let’s hide  tools   bushes” the boys  there  night about  appointed time they sat   shadow waiting it   lonely place   hour made solemn  old traditions spirits whispered   rustling leaves ghosts lurked   murky nooks  deep baying   hound floated up out   distance  owl answered  his sepulchral note the boys  subdued  these solemnities  talked little by   they judged  twelve had come they marked where  shadow fell  began  dig their hopes commenced  rise their interest grew stronger  their industry kept pace  it the hole deepened  still deepened but every time their hearts jumped  hear  pick strike upon something they only suffered  new disappointment it  only  stone or  chunk at last tom said “it ain’t any use huck we’re wrong again” “well but we can’t  wrong we spotted  shadder   dot” “i know it but then there’s another thing” “what’s that” “why we only guessed   time like enough   too late or too early” huck dropped his shovel “that’s it” said he “that’s  very trouble we got  give this one up we can’t ever tell  right time  besides this kind  thing’s too awful here this time  night  witches  ghosts afluttering around so i feel  if something’s behind me all  time  i’m afeard  turn around becuz maybe there’s others  front awaiting   chance i been creeping all over ever since i got here” “well i’ve been pretty much so too huck they most always put   dead man when they bury  treasure under  tree  look out  it” “lordy” “yes they do i’ve always heard that” “tom i don’t like  fool around much where there’s dead people a body’s bound  get into trouble  ’em sure” “i don’t like  stir ’em up either s’pose this one here   stick his skull out  say something” “don’t tom it’s awful” “well  just is huck i don’t feel comfortable  bit” “say tom let’s give this place up  try somewheres else” “all right i reckon we better” “what’ll  be” tom considered awhile  then said “the ha’nted house that’s it” “blame it i don’t like ha’nted houses tom why they’re  dern sight worse’n dead people dead people might talk maybe but they don’t come sliding around   shroud when you ain’t noticing  peep over your shoulder all   sudden  grit their teeth  way  ghost does i couldn’t stand such  thing  that tom—nobody could” “yes but huck ghosts don’t travel around only  night they won’t hender us  digging there   daytime” “well that’s so but you know mighty well people don’t go about  ha’nted house   day nor  night” “well that’s mostly because they don’t like  go where  man’s been murdered anyway—but nothing’s ever been seen around  house except   night—just some blue lights slipping   windows—no regular ghosts” “well where you see one  them blue lights flickering around tom you can bet there’s  ghost mighty close behind it it stands  reason becuz you know  they don’t anybody but ghosts use ’em” “yes that’s so but anyway they don’t come around   daytime so what’s  use  our being afeard” “well all right we’ll tackle  ha’nted house if you say so—but i reckon it’s taking chances” they had started down  hill  this time there   middle   moonlit valley below them stood  “ha’nted” house utterly isolated  fences gone long ago rank weeds smothering  very doorsteps  chimney crumbled  ruin  windowsashes vacant  corner   roof caved in the boys gazed awhile half expecting  see  blue light flit past  window then talking   low tone  befitted  time   circumstances they struck far off   right  give  haunted house  wide berth  took their way homeward through  woods  adorned  rearward side  cardiff hill chapter xxvi about noon  next day  boys arrived   dead tree they had come  their tools tom  impatient  go   haunted house huck  measurably so also—but suddenly said “lookyhere tom do you know what day  is” tom mentally ran over  days   week  then quickly lifted his eyes   startled look  them— “my i never once thought  it huck” “well i didn’t neither but all  once  popped onto me    friday” “blame it  body can’t  too careful huck we might ’a’ got into  awful scrape tackling such  thing   friday” “might better say we would there’s some lucky days maybe but friday ain’t” “any fool knows that i don’t reckon you   first  found  out huck” “well i never said i was did i and friday ain’t all neither i had  rotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats” “no sure sign  trouble did they fight” “no” “well that’s good huck when they don’t fight it’s only  sign  there’s trouble around you know all we got  do   look mighty sharp  keep out  it we’ll drop this thing  today  play do you know robin hood huck” “no who’s robin hood” “why   one   greatest men   ever  england—and  best he   robber” “cracky i wisht i was who did  rob” “only sheriffs  bishops  rich people  kings  such like but  never bothered  poor he loved ’em he always divided up  ’em perfectly square” “well  must ’a’ been  brick” “i bet you  was huck oh    noblest man  ever was they ain’t any such men now i can tell you he could lick any man  england  one hand tied behind him   could take his yew bow  plug  tencent piece every time  mile   half” “what’s  yew bow” “i don’t know it’s some kind   bow  course and if  hit  dime only   edge  would set down  cry—and curse but we’ll play robin hood—it’s nobby fun i’ll learn you” “i’m agreed” so they played robin hood all  afternoon now  then casting  yearning eye down upon  haunted house  passing  remark about  morrow’s prospects  possibilities there as  sun began  sink into  west they took their way homeward athwart  long shadows   trees  soon  buried  sight   forests  cardiff hill on saturday shortly after noon  boys    dead tree again they had  smoke   chat   shade  then dug  little  their last hole not  great hope but merely because tom said there  so many cases where people had given up  treasure after getting down within six inches  it  then somebody else had come along  turned  up   single thrust   shovel the thing failed this time however so  boys shouldered their tools  went away feeling  they had not trifled  fortune but had fulfilled all  requirements  belong   business  treasurehunting when they reached  haunted house there  something so weird  grisly about  dead silence  reigned there under  baking sun  something so depressing about  loneliness  desolation   place  they  afraid   moment  venture in then they crept   door  took  trembling peep they saw  weedgrown floorless room unplastered  ancient fireplace vacant windows  ruinous staircase  here there  everywhere hung ragged  abandoned cobwebs they presently entered softly  quickened pulses talking  whispers ears alert  catch  slightest sound  muscles tense  ready  instant retreat in  little while familiarity modified their fears  they gave  place  critical  interested examination rather admiring their own boldness  wondering  it too next they wanted  look upstairs this  something like cutting off retreat but they got  daring each other   course there could  but one result—they threw their tools into  corner  made  ascent up there   same signs  decay in one corner they found  closet  promised mystery but  promise   fraud—there  nothing  it their courage  up now  well  hand they  about  go down  begin work when— “sh” said tom “what  it” whispered huck blanching  fright “sh there hear it” “yes oh my let’s run” “keep still don’t you budge they’re coming right toward  door” the boys stretched themselves upon  floor  their eyes  knotholes   planking  lay waiting   misery  fear “they’ve stopped no—coming here they are don’t whisper another word huck my goodness i wish i  out  this” two men entered each boy said  himself “there’s  old deaf  dumb spaniard that’s been about town once or twice lately—never saw t’other man before” “t’other”   ragged unkempt creature  nothing very pleasant  his face the spaniard  wrapped   serape  had bushy white whiskers long white hair flowed  under his sombrero   wore green goggles when they came in “t’other”  talking   low voice they sat down   ground facing  door  their backs   wall   speaker continued his remarks his manner became less guarded  his words more distinct   proceeded “no” said he “i’ve thought  all over  i don’t like it it’s dangerous” “dangerous” grunted  “deaf  dumb” spaniard—to  vast surprise   boys “milksop” this voice made  boys gasp  quake it  injun joe’s there  silence  some time then joe said “what’s any more dangerous than  job up yonder—but nothing’s come  it” “that’s different away up  river so  not another house about ’twon’t ever  known  we tried anyway long  we didn’t succeed” “well what’s more dangerous than coming here   daytime—anybody would suspicion us  saw us” “i know that but there warn’t any other place  handy after  fool   job i want  quit this shanty i wanted  yesterday only  warn’t any use trying  stir out  here  those infernal boys playing over there   hill right  full view” “those infernal boys” quaked again under  inspiration  this remark  thought how lucky    they had remembered   friday  concluded  wait  day they wished  their hearts they had waited  year the two men got out some food  made  luncheon after  long  thoughtful silence injun joe said “look here lad—you go back up  river where you belong wait there till you hear  me i’ll take  chances  dropping into this town just once more   look we’ll do  ‘dangerous’ job after i’ve spied around  little  think things look well  it then  texas we’ll leg  together” this  satisfactory both men presently fell  yawning  injun joe said “i’m dead  sleep it’s your turn  watch” he curled down   weeds  soon began  snore his comrade stirred him once or twice   became quiet presently  watcher began  nod his head drooped lower  lower both men began  snore now the boys drew  long grateful breath tom whispered “now’s our chance—come” huck said “i can’t—i’d die if they   wake” tom urged—huck held back at last tom rose slowly  softly  started alone but  first step  made wrung such  hideous creak   crazy floor   sank down almost dead  fright he never made  second attempt the boys lay there counting  dragging moments till  seemed  them  time must  done  eternity growing gray  then they  grateful  note   last  sun  setting now one snore ceased injun joe sat up stared around—smiled grimly upon his comrade whose head  drooping upon his knees—stirred him up  his foot  said “here you’re  watchman ain’t you all right though—nothing’s happened” “my have i been asleep” “oh partly partly nearly time  us   moving pard what’ll we do  what little swag we’ve got left” “i don’t know—leave  here  we’ve always done i reckon no use  take  away till we start south six hundred  fifty  silver’s something  carry” “well—all right—it won’t matter  come here once more” “no—but i’d say come   night  we used  do—it’s better” “yes but look here  may   good while before i get  right chance   job accidents might happen ’tain’t  such  very good place we’ll just regularly bury it—and bury  deep” “good idea” said  comrade who walked across  room knelt down raised one   rearward hearthstones  took out  bag  jingled pleasantly he subtracted   twenty or thirty dollars  himself   much  injun joe  passed  bag   latter who   his knees   corner now digging  his bowieknife the boys forgot all their fears all their miseries   instant with gloating eyes they watched every movement luck—the splendor    beyond all imagination six hundred dollars  money enough  make half  dozen boys rich here  treasurehunting under  happiest auspices—there would not  any bothersome uncertainty   where  dig they nudged each other every moment—eloquent nudges  easily understood  they simply meant—“oh but ain’t you glad now we’re here” joe’s knife struck upon something “hello” said he “what  it” said his comrade “halfrotten plank—no it’s  box i believe here—bear  hand  we’ll see what it’s here for never mind i’ve broke  hole” he reached his hand   drew  out— “man it’s money” the two men examined  handful  coins they  gold the boys above   excited  themselves   delighted joe’s comrade said “we’ll make quick work  this there’s  old rusty pick over amongst  weeds   corner  other side   fireplace—i saw   minute ago” he ran  brought  boys’ pick  shovel injun joe took  pick looked  over critically shook his head muttered something  himself  then began  use it the box  soon unearthed it  not very large   iron bound  had been very strong before  slow years had injured it the men contemplated  treasure awhile  blissful silence “pard there’s thousands  dollars here” said injun joe “’twas always said  murrel’s gang used   around here one summer”  stranger observed “i know it” said injun joe “and this looks like it i should say” “now you won’t need  do  job” the halfbreed frowned said he “you don’t know me least you don’t know all about  thing ’tain’t robbery altogether—it’s revenge”   wicked light flamed  his eyes “i’ll need your help  it when it’s finished—then texas go home  your nance  your kids  stand  till you hear  me” “well—if you say so what’ll we do  this—bury  again” “yes ravishing delight overhead no   great sachem no profound distress overhead i’d nearly forgot that pick had fresh earth  it the boys  sick  terror   moment what business   pick   shovel here what business  fresh earth  them who brought them here—and where  they gone have you heard anybody—seen anybody what bury  again  leave them  come  see  ground disturbed not exactly—not exactly we’ll take   my den” “why  course might have thought   before you mean number one” “no—number two—under  cross the other place  bad—too common” “all right it’s nearly dark enough  start” injun joe got up  went about  window  window cautiously peeping out presently  said “who could have brought those tools here do you reckon they can  upstairs” the boys’ breath forsook them injun joe put his hand  his knife halted  moment undecided  then turned toward  stairway the boys thought   closet but their strength  gone the steps came creaking up  stairs—the intolerable distress   situation woke  stricken resolution   lads—they  about  spring   closet when there   crash  rotten timbers  injun joe landed   ground amid  debris   ruined stairway he gathered himself up cursing  his comrade said “now what’s  use  all that if it’s anybody  they’re up there let them stay there—who cares if they want  jump down now  get into trouble who objects it   dark  fifteen minutes—and then let them follow us if they want to i’m willing in my opinion whoever hove those things  here caught  sight  us  took us  ghosts or devils or something i’ll bet they’re running yet” joe grumbled awhile then  agreed  his friend  what daylight  left ought   economized  getting things ready  leaving shortly afterward they slipped out   house   deepening twilight  moved toward  river  their precious box tom  huck rose up weak but vastly relieved  stared after them through  chinks between  logs   house follow not they they  content  reach ground again without broken necks  take  townward track over  hill they did not talk much they  too much absorbed  hating themselves—hating  ill luck  made them take  spade   pick there but  that injun joe never would have suspected he would have hidden  silver   gold  wait there till his “revenge”  satisfied  then  would have had  misfortune  find  money turn up missing bitter bitter luck   tools  ever brought there they resolved  keep  lookout   spaniard when  should come  town spying out  chances  do his revengeful job  follow him  “number two” wherever  might be then  ghastly thought occurred  tom “revenge what if  means us huck” “oh don’t” said huck nearly fainting they talked  all over   they entered town they agreed  believe   might possibly mean somebody else—at least   might  least mean nobody but tom since only tom had testified very very small comfort    tom   alone  danger company would   palpable improvement  thought chapter xxvii the adventure   day mightily tormented tom’s dreams  night four times  had his hands   rich treasure  four times  wasted  nothingness  his fingers  sleep forsook him  wakefulness brought back  hard reality  his misfortune as  lay   early morning recalling  incidents  his great adventure  noticed  they seemed curiously subdued  far away—somewhat  if they had happened  another world or   time long gone by then  occurred  him   great adventure itself must   dream there  one very strong argument  favor  this idea—namely   quantity  coin  had seen  too vast   real he had never seen  much  fifty dollars  one mass before    like all boys  his age  station  life    imagined  all references  “hundreds”  “thousands”  mere fanciful forms  speech   no such sums really existed   world he never had supposed   moment  so large  sum   hundred dollars    found  actual money  any one’s possession if his notions  hidden treasure had been analyzed they would have been found  consist   handful  real dimes   bushel  vague splendid ungraspable dollars but  incidents  his adventure grew sensibly sharper  clearer under  attrition  thinking them over  so  presently found himself leaning   impression   thing might not have been  dream after all this uncertainty must  swept away he would snatch  hurried breakfast  go  find huck huck  sitting   gunwale   flatboat listlessly dangling his feet   water  looking very melancholy tom concluded  let huck lead up   subject if  did not do it then  adventure would  proved  have been only  dream “hello huck” “hello yourself” silence   minute “tom if we’d ’a’ left  blame tools   dead tree we’d ’a’ got  money oh ain’t  awful” “’tain’t  dream then ’tain’t  dream somehow i most wish  was dog’d if i don’t huck” “what ain’t  dream” “oh  thing yesterday i been half thinking  was” “dream if them stairs hadn’t broke down you’d ’a’ seen how much dream  was i’ve had dreams enough all night—with  patcheyed spanish devil going  me all through ’em—rot him” “no not rot him find him track  money” “tom we’ll never find him a feller don’t have only one chance  such  pile—and  one’s lost i’d feel mighty shaky if i   see him anyway” “well so’d i but i’d like  see him anyway—and track him out—to his number two” “number two—yes that’s it i been thinking ’bout that but i can’t make nothing out  it what do you reckon  is” “i dono it’s too deep say huck—maybe it’s  number   house” “goody no tom  ain’t it if  is  ain’t  this onehorse town they ain’t no numbers here” “well that’s so lemme think  minute here—it’s  number   room—in  tavern you know” “oh that’s  trick they ain’t only two taverns we can find out quick” “you stay here huck till i come” tom  off  once he did not care  have huck’s company  public places he  gone half  hour he found    best tavern no  had long been occupied   young lawyer   still so occupied in  less ostentatious house no    mystery the tavernkeeper’s young son said   kept locked all  time   never saw anybody go into  or come out   except  night  did not know any particular reason  this state  things had had some little curiosity but   rather feeble had made  most   mystery  entertaining himself   idea   room  “ha’nted” had noticed  there   light  there  night before “that’s what i’ve found out huck i reckon that’s  very no  we’re after” “i reckon  is tom now what you going  do” “lemme think” tom thought  long time then  said “i’ll tell you the back door   no    door  comes out into  little close alley between  tavern   old rattle trap   brick store now you get hold  all  doorkeys you can find  i’ll nip all  auntie’s   first dark night we’ll go there  try ’em and mind you keep  lookout  injun joe because  said   going  drop into town  spy around once more   chance  get his revenge if you see him you just follow him  if  don’t go   no   ain’t  place” “lordy i don’t want  foller him  myself” “why it’ll  night sure he mightn’t ever see you—and if  did maybe he’d never think anything” “well if it’s pretty dark i reckon i’ll track him i dono—i dono i’ll try” “you bet i’ll follow him if it’s dark huck why  might ’a’ found out  couldn’t get his revenge   going right after  money” “it’s so tom it’s so i’ll foller him i will  jingoes” “now you’re talking don’t you ever weaken huck  i won’t” chapter xxviii that night tom  huck  ready  their adventure they hung about  neighborhood   tavern until after nine one watching  alley   distance   other  tavern door nobody entered  alley or left it nobody resembling  spaniard entered or left  tavern door the night promised    fair one so tom went home   understanding  if  considerable degree  darkness came on huck   come  “maow” whereupon  would slip out  try  keys but  night remained clear  huck closed his watch  retired  bed   empty sugar hogshead about twelve tuesday  boys had  same ill luck also wednesday but thursday night promised better tom slipped out  good season  his aunt’s old tin lantern   large towel  blindfold  with he hid  lantern  huck’s sugar hogshead   watch began an hour before midnight  tavern closed up   lights the only ones thereabouts  put out no spaniard had been seen nobody had entered or left  alley everything  auspicious the blackness  darkness reigned  perfect stillness  interrupted only  occasional mutterings  distant thunder tom got his lantern lit    hogshead wrapped  closely   towel   two adventurers crept   gloom toward  tavern huck stood sentry  tom felt his way into  alley then there   season  waiting anxiety  weighed upon huck’s spirits like  mountain he began  wish  could see  flash   lantern—it would frighten him but  would  least tell him  tom  alive yet it seemed hours since tom had disappeared surely  must have fainted maybe   dead maybe his heart had burst under terror  excitement in his uneasiness huck found himself drawing closer  closer   alley fearing all sorts  dreadful things  momentarily expecting some catastrophe  happen  would take away his breath there  not much  take away   seemed only able  inhale   thimblefuls  his heart would soon wear itself out  way   beating suddenly there   flash  light  tom came tearing  him “run” said he “run  your life” he needn’t have repeated it once  enough huck  making thirty or forty miles  hour before  repetition  uttered the boys never stopped till they reached  shed   deserted slaughterhouse   lower end   village just  they got within  shelter  storm burst   rain poured down as soon  tom got his breath  said “huck   awful i tried two   keys just  soft  i could but they seemed  make such  power  racket  i couldn’t hardly get my breath i  so scared they wouldn’t turn   lock either well without noticing what i  doing i took hold   knob  open comes  door it warn’t locked i hopped in  shook off  towel and great caesar’s ghost” “what—what’d you see tom” “huck i most stepped onto injun joe’s hand” “no” “yes he  lying there sound asleep   floor  his old patch  his eye  his arms spread out” “lordy what did you do did  wake up” “no never budged drunk i reckon i just grabbed  towel  started” “i’d never ’a’ thought   towel i bet” “well i would my aunt would make me mighty sick if i lost it” “say tom did you see  box” “huck i didn’t wait  look around i didn’t see  box i didn’t see  cross i didn’t see anything but  bottle   tin cup   floor  injun joe yes i saw two barrels  lots more bottles   room don’t you see now what’s  matter   ha’nted room” “how” “why it’s ha’nted  whiskey maybe all  temperance taverns have got  ha’nted room hey huck” “well i reckon maybe that’s so who’d ’a’ thought such  thing but say tom now’s  mighty good time  get  box if injun joe’s drunk” “it is that you try it” huck shuddered “well no—i reckon not” “and i reckon not huck only one bottle alongside  injun joe ain’t enough if there’d been three he’d  drunk enough  i’d do it” there   long pause  reflection  then tom said “lookyhere huck less not try  thing any more till we know injun joe’s not  there it’s too scary now if we watch every night we’ll  dead sure  see him go out some time or other  then we’ll snatch  box quicker’n lightning” “well i’m agreed i’ll watch  whole night long  i’ll do  every night too if you’ll do  other part   job” “all right i will all you got  do   trot up hooper street  block  maow—and if i’m asleep you throw some gravel   window  that’ll fetch me” “agreed  good  wheat” “now huck  storm’s over  i’ll go home it’ll begin   daylight   couple  hours you go back  watch  long  you” “i said i would tom  i will i’ll ha’nt  tavern every night   year i’ll sleep all day  i’ll stand watch all night” “that’s all right now where you going  sleep” “in ben rogers’ hayloft he lets me  so does his pap’s nigger man uncle jake i tote water  uncle jake whenever  wants me to  any time i ask him  gives me  little something  eat if  can spare it that’s  mighty good nigger tom he likes me becuz i don’t ever act  if i  above him sometime i’ve set right down  eat with him but you needn’t tell that a body’s got  do things when he’s awful hungry  wouldn’t want  do   steady thing” “well if i don’t want you   daytime i’ll let you sleep i won’t come bothering around any time you see something’s up   night just skip right around  maow” chapter xxix the first thing tom heard  friday morning   glad piece  news—judge thatcher’s family had come back  town  night before both injun joe   treasure sunk into secondary importance   moment  becky took  chief place   boy’s interest he saw her  they had  exhausting good time playing “hispy”  “gullykeeper”   crowd  their schoolmates the day  completed  crowned   peculiarly satisfactory way becky teased her mother  appoint  next day   longpromised  longdelayed picnic  she consented the child’s delight  boundless  tom’s not more moderate the invitations  sent out before sunset  straightway  young folks   village  thrown into  fever  preparation  pleasurable anticipation tom’s excitement enabled him  keep awake until  pretty late hour   had good hopes  hearing huck’s “maow”   having his treasure  astonish becky   picnickers with next day but   disappointed no signal came  night morning came eventually   ten or eleven o’clock  giddy  rollicking company  gathered  judge thatcher’s  everything  ready   start it  not  custom  elderly people  mar  picnics  their presence the children  considered safe enough under  wings   few young ladies  eighteen   few young gentlemen  twentythree or thereabouts the old steam ferryboat  chartered   occasion presently  gay throng filed up  main street laden  provisionbaskets sid  sick  had  miss  fun mary remained  home  entertain him the last thing mrs thatcher said  becky was “you’ll not get back till late perhaps you’d better stay all night  some   girls  live near  ferrylanding child” “then i’ll stay  susy harper mamma” “very well and mind  behave yourself  don’t  any trouble” presently  they tripped along tom said  becky “say—i’ll tell you what we’ll do ’stead  going  joe harper’s we’ll climb right up  hill  stop   widow douglas’ she’ll have icecream she   most every day—dead loads  it and she’ll  awful glad  have us” “oh    fun” then becky reflected  moment  said “but what  mamma say” “how’ll she ever know” the girl turned  idea over  her mind  said reluctantly “i reckon it’s wrong—but—” “but shucks your mother won’t know  so what’s  harm all she wants   you’ll  safe  i bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if she’d ’a’ thought  it i know she would” the widow douglas’ splendid hospitality   tempting bait it  tom’s persuasions presently carried  day so   decided  say nothing  anybody about  night’s programme presently  occurred  tom  maybe huck might come this very night  give  signal the thought took  deal   spirit out  his anticipations still  could not bear  give up  fun  widow douglas’ and why should  give  up  reasoned—the signal did not come  night before so why should   any more likely  come tonight the sure fun   evening outweighed  uncertain treasure and boylike  determined  yield   stronger inclination  not allow himself  think   box  money another time  day three miles below town  ferryboat stopped   mouth   woody hollow  tied up the crowd swarmed ashore  soon  forest distances  craggy heights echoed far  near  shoutings  laughter all  different ways  getting hot  tired  gone through with  byandby  rovers straggled back  camp fortified  responsible appetites  then  destruction   good things began after  feast there   refreshing season  rest  chat   shade  spreading oaks byandby somebody shouted “who’s ready   cave” everybody was bundles  candles  procured  straightway there   general scamper up  hill the mouth   cave  up  hillside—an opening shaped like  letter a its massive oaken door stood unbarred within   small chamber chilly   icehouse  walled  nature  solid limestone   dewy   cold sweat it  romantic  mysterious  stand here   deep gloom  look out upon  green valley shining   sun but  impressiveness   situation quickly wore off   romping began again the moment  candle  lighted there   general rush upon  owner  it  struggle   gallant defence followed but  candle  soon knocked down or blown out  then there   glad clamor  laughter   new chase but all things have  end byandby  procession went filing down  steep descent   main avenue  flickering rank  lights dimly revealing  lofty walls  rock almost  their point  junction sixty feet overhead this main avenue  not more than eight or ten feet wide every few steps other lofty  still narrower crevices branched    either hand—for mcdougal’s cave  but  vast labyrinth  crooked aisles  ran into each other  out again  led nowhere it  said  one might wander days  nights together through  intricate tangle  rifts  chasms  never find  end   cave    might go down  down  still down into  earth    just  same—labyrinth under labyrinth  no end  any  them no man “knew”  cave that   impossible thing most   young men knew  portion  it    not customary  venture much beyond this known portion tom sawyer knew  much   cave  any one the procession moved along  main avenue some threequarters   mile  then groups  couples began  slip aside into branch avenues fly along  dismal corridors  take each other  surprise  points where  corridors joined again parties  able  elude each other   space  half  hour without going beyond  “known” ground byandby one group after another came straggling back   mouth   cave panting hilarious smeared  head  foot  tallow drippings daubed  clay  entirely delighted   success   day then they  astonished  find  they had been taking no note  time   night  about  hand the clanging bell had been calling  half  hour however this sort  close   day’s adventures  romantic  therefore satisfactory when  ferryboat  her wild freight pushed into  stream nobody cared sixpence   wasted time but  captain   craft huck  already upon his watch when  ferryboat’s lights went glinting past  wharf he heard no noise  board   young people   subdued  still  people usually  who  nearly tired  death he wondered what boat  was  why she did not stop   wharf—and then  dropped her out  his mind  put his attention upon his business the night  growing cloudy  dark ten o’clock came   noise  vehicles ceased scattered lights began  wink out all straggling footpassengers disappeared  village betook itself   slumbers  left  small watcher alone   silence   ghosts eleven o’clock came   tavern lights  put out darkness everywhere now huck waited what seemed  weary long time but nothing happened his faith  weakening was there any use was there really any use why not give  up  turn in a noise fell upon his ear he  all attention   instant the alley door closed softly he sprang   corner   brick store the next moment two men brushed  him  one seemed  have something under his arm it must   box so they  going  remove  treasure why call tom now it would  absurd—the men would get away   box  never  found again no  would stick  their wake  follow them  would trust   darkness  security  discovery so communing  himself huck stepped out  glided along behind  men catlike  bare feet allowing them  keep just far enough ahead not   invisible they moved up  river street three blocks then turned   left up  crossstreet they went straight ahead then until they came   path  led up cardiff hill this they took they passed   old welshman’s house halfway up  hill without hesitating  still climbed upward good thought huck they  bury    old quarry but they never stopped   quarry they passed on up  summit they plunged into  narrow path between  tall sumach bushes    once hidden   gloom huck closed up  shortened his distance now  they would never  able  see him he trotted along awhile then slackened his pace fearing   gaining too fast moved   piece then stopped altogether listened no sound none save   seemed  hear  beating  his own heart the hooting   owl came over  hill—ominous sound but no footsteps heavens  everything lost he  about  spring  winged feet when  man cleared his throat not four feet  him huck’s heart shot into his throat but  swallowed  again  then  stood there shaking  if  dozen agues had taken charge  him  once  so weak   thought  must surely fall   ground he knew where  was he knew   within five steps   stile leading into widow douglas’ grounds very well  thought let them bury  there  won’t  hard  find now there   voice—a very low voice—injun joe’s “damn her maybe she’s got company—there’s lights late   is” “i can’t see any” this   stranger’s voice—the stranger   haunted house a deadly chill went  huck’s heart—this then   “revenge” job his thought was  fly then  remembered   widow douglas had been kind  him more than once  maybe these men  going  murder her he wished  dared venture  warn her but  knew  didn’t dare—they might come  catch him he thought all this  more   moment  elapsed between  stranger’s remark  injun joe’s next—which was— “because  bush   your way now—this way—now you see don’t you” “yes well there is company there i reckon better give  up” “give  up  i just leaving this country forever give  up  maybe never have another chance i tell you again  i’ve told you before i don’t care  her swag—you may have it but her husband  rough  me—many times   rough  me—and mainly    justice   peace  jugged me   vagrant and  ain’t all it ain’t  millionth part  it he had me horsewhipped—horsewhipped  front   jail like  nigger—with all  town looking on horsewhipped—do you understand he took advantage  me  died but i’ll take  out  her” “oh don’t kill her don’t do that” “kill who said anything about killing i would kill him if   here but not her when you want  get revenge   woman you don’t kill her—bosh you go  her looks you slit her nostrils—you notch her ears like  sow” “by god that’s—” “keep your opinion  yourself it   safest  you i’ll tie her   bed if she bleeds  death   my fault i’ll not cry if she does my friend you’ll help me  this thing—for my sake—that’s why you’re here—i mightn’t  able alone if you flinch i’ll kill you do you understand that and if i have  kill you i’ll kill her—and then i reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business” “well if it’s got   done let’s get  it the quicker  better—i’m all   shiver” “do  now and company there look here—i’ll get suspicious  you first thing you know no—we’ll wait till  lights  out—there’s no hurry” huck felt   silence  going  ensue—a thing still more awful than any amount  murderous talk so  held his breath  stepped gingerly back planted his foot carefully  firmly after balancing onelegged   precarious way  almost toppling over first  one side  then   other he took another step back   same elaboration   same risks then another  another and—a twig snapped under his foot his breath stopped   listened there  no sound—the stillness  perfect his gratitude  measureless now  turned  his tracks between  walls  sumach bushes—turned himself  carefully  if    ship—and then stepped quickly but cautiously along when  emerged   quarry  felt secure  so  picked up his nimble heels  flew down down  sped till  reached  welshman’s he banged   door  presently  heads   old man  his two stalwart sons  thrust  windows “what’s  row there who’s banging what do you want” “let me in—quick i’ll tell everything” “why who  you” “huckleberry finn—quick let me in” “huckleberry finn indeed it ain’t  name  open many doors i judge but let him in lads  let’s see what’s  trouble” “please don’t ever tell i told you”  huck’s first words when  got in “please don’t—i’d  killed sure—but  widow’s been good friends  me sometimes  i want  tell—i will tell if you’ll promise you won’t ever say   me” “by george  has got something  tell or  wouldn’t act so” exclaimed  old man “out    nobody here’ll ever tell lad” three minutes later  old man  his sons well armed  up  hill  just entering  sumach path  tiptoe their weapons  their hands huck accompanied them no further he hid behind  great bowlder  fell  listening there   lagging anxious silence  then all   sudden there   explosion  firearms   cry huck waited  no particulars he sprang away  sped down  hill  fast  his legs could carry him chapter xxx as  earliest suspicion  dawn appeared  sunday morning huck came groping up  hill  rapped gently   old welshman’s door the inmates  asleep but    sleep   set   hairtrigger  account   exciting episode   night a call came   window “who’s there” huck’s scared voice answered   low tone “please let me in it’s only huck finn” “it’s  name  can open this door night or day lad—and welcome” these  strange words   vagabond boy’s ears   pleasantest  had ever heard he could not recollect   closing word had ever been applied  his case before the door  quickly unlocked   entered huck  given  seat   old man  his brace  tall sons speedily dressed themselves “now my boy i hope you’re good  hungry because breakfast   ready  soon   sun’s up  we’ll have  piping hot one too—make yourself easy about that i   boys hoped you’d turn up  stop here last night” “i  awful scared” said huck “and i run i took out when  pistols went off  i didn’t stop  three mile i’ve come now becuz i wanted  know about it you know  i come before daylight becuz i didn’t want  run across them devils even if they  dead” “well poor chap you do look  if you’d had  hard night  it—but there’s  bed here  you when you’ve had your breakfast no they ain’t dead lad—we  sorry enough  that you see we knew right where  put our hands  them  your description so we crept along  tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet  them—dark   cellar  sumach path was—and just then i found i  going  sneeze it   meanest kind  luck i tried  keep  back but no use—’twas bound  come   did come i    lead  my pistol raised  when  sneeze started those scoundrels arustling  get out   path i sung out ‘fire boys’  blazed away   place where  rustling was so did  boys but they  off   jiffy those villains  we after them down through  woods i judge we never touched them they fired  shot apiece  they started but their bullets whizzed   didn’t do us any harm as soon  we lost  sound  their feet we quit chasing  went down  stirred up  constables they got  posse together  went off  guard  river bank   soon    light  sheriff   gang  going  beat up  woods my boys    them presently i wish we had some sort  description  those rascals—’twould help  good deal but you couldn’t see what they  like   dark lad i suppose” “oh yes i saw them downtown  follered them” “splendid describe them—describe them my boy” “one’s  old deaf  dumb spaniard that’s ben around here once or twice  t’other’s  meanlooking ragged—” “that’s enough lad we know  men happened  them   woods back   widow’s one day  they slunk away off  you boys  tell  sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning” the welshman’s sons departed  once as they  leaving  room huck sprang up  exclaimed “oh please don’t tell anybody   me  blowed  them oh please” “all right if you say it huck but you ought  have  credit  what you did” “oh no no please don’t tell” when  young men  gone  old welshman said “they won’t tell—and i won’t but why don’t you want  known” huck would not explain further than  say   already knew too much about one  those men  would not have  man know   knew anything against him   whole world—he would  killed  knowing it sure the old man promised secrecy once more  said “how did you come  follow these fellows lad were they looking suspicious” huck  silent while  framed  duly cautious reply then  said “well you see i’m  kind   hard lot—least everybody says so  i don’t see nothing agin it—and sometimes i can’t sleep much  account  thinking about   sort  trying  strike out  new way  doing that   way   last night i couldn’t sleep  so i come along upstreet ’bout midnight aturning  all over  when i got   old shackly brick store   temperance tavern i backed up agin  wall  have another think well just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close  me  something under their arm  i reckoned they’d stole it one  asmoking  t’other one wanted  light so they stopped right before me   cigars lit up their faces  i see   big one   deaf  dumb spaniard  his white whiskers   patch  his eye  t’other one   rusty raggedlooking devil” “could you see  rags   light   cigars” this staggered huck   moment then  said “well i don’t know—but somehow  seems  if i did” “then they went on  you—” “follered ’em—yes that  it i wanted  see what  up—they sneaked along so i dogged ’em   widder’s stile  stood   dark  heard  ragged one beg   widder   spaniard swear he’d spile her looks just  i told you  your two—” “what the deaf  dumb man said all that” huck had made another terrible mistake he  trying his best  keep  old man  getting  faintest hint  who  spaniard might be  yet his tongue seemed determined  get him into trouble  spite  all  could do he made several efforts  creep out  his scrape but  old man’s eye  upon him   made blunder after blunder presently  welshman said “my boy don’t  afraid  me i wouldn’t

want  keep dark now trust me—tell me what  is  trust me—i won’t betray you” huck looked into  old man’s honest eyes  moment then bent over  whispered  his ear “’tain’t  spaniard—it’s injun joe” the welshman almost jumped out  his chair in  moment  said “it’s all plain enough now when you talked about notching ears  slitting noses i judged    your own embellishment because white men don’t take  sort  revenge but  injun that’s  different matter altogether” during breakfast  talk went on    course    old man said   last thing which   his sons had done before going  bed   get  lantern  examine

eyes  staring wide now  his breath suspended—waiting   answer the welshman started—stared  return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied “of burglar’s tools why what’s  matter  you” huck sank back panting gently but deeply unutterably grateful the welshman eyed him gravely curiously—and presently said “yes burglar’s tools that appears  relieve you  good deal but what did give you  turn what  you expecting we’d found” huck    close place—the inquiring eye  upon him—he would have given anything  material   plausible answer—nothing suggested itself—the inquiring eye  boring deeper  deeper—a senseless reply offered—there  no time  weigh it so   venture  uttered it—feebly “sundayschool books maybe” poor huck  too distressed  smile but  old man laughed loud  joyously shook up  details  his anatomy  head  foot  ended  saying  such  laugh  money  aman’s pocket because  cut down  doctor’s bill like everything then  added “poor old chap you’re white  jaded—you ain’t well

“don’t say  word about it madam there’s another  you’re more beholden  than you   me  my boys maybe but  don’t allow me  tell his name we wouldn’t have been there but  him” of course this excited  curiosity so vast   almost belittled  main matter—but  welshman allowed   eat into  vitals  his visitors  through them  transmitted   whole town   refused  part  his secret when all else had been learned  widow said “i went  sleep reading  bed  slept straight through all  noise why didn’t you come  wake me” “we judged  warn’t worth while those fellows warn’t likely  come again—they hadn’t any

 couple  hours more there  no sabbathschool during dayschool vacation but everybody  early  church the stirring event  well canvassed news came  not  sign   two villains had been yet discovered when  sermon  finished judge thatcher’s wife dropped alongside  mrs harper  she moved down  aisle   crowd  said “is my becky going  sleep all day i just expected she would  tired  death” “your becky” “yes”   startled look—“didn’t she stay  you last night” “why no” mrs thatcher turned pale  sank into  pew just  aunt polly talking briskly   friend passed by aunt polly said “goodmorning mrs thatcher goodmorning mrs harper i’ve got  boy that’s turned up missing i reckon my tom stayed  your house last night—one  you and now he’s afraid  come  church i’ve got  settle  him” mrs thatcher shook her head feebly  turned paler than ever “he didn’t stay  us” said mrs harper beginning  look uneasy a marked anxiety came into aunt polly’s face “joe harper have you seen my tom this morning” “no’m” “when did you see him last” joe tried  remember but  not sure  could say the people had stopped moving out  church whispers passed along   boding uneasiness took possession  every countenance children  anxiously questioned  young teachers they all said they had not noticed whether tom  becky   board  ferryboat   homeward trip   dark no one thought  inquiring if any one  missing one young man finally blurted out his fear  they  still   cave mrs thatcher swooned away aunt polly fell  crying  wringing her hands the alarm swept  lip  lip  group  group  street  street  within five minutes  bells  wildly clanging   whole town  up the cardiff hill episode sank into instant insignificance  burglars  forgotten horses  saddled skiffs  manned  ferryboat ordered out  before  horror  half  hour old two hundred men  pouring down highroad  river toward  cave all  long afternoon  village seemed empty  dead many women visited aunt polly  mrs thatcher  tried  comfort them they cried  them too    still better than words all  tedious night  town waited  news but when  morning dawned  last all  word  came was “send more candles—and send food” mrs thatcher  almost crazed  aunt polly also judge thatcher sent messages  hope  encouragement   cave but they conveyed no real cheer the old welshman came home toward daylight spattered  candlegrease smeared  clay  almost worn out he found huck still

 lord’s  nothing    lord’s   thing   neglected the welshman said huck had good spots  him   widow said “you can depend  it that’s  lord’s mark he don’t leave  off he never does puts  somewhere  every creature  comes  his hands” early   forenoon parties  jaded men began  straggle into  village but  strongest   citizens continued searching all  news  could  gained   remotenesses   cavern  being ransacked  had never been visited before  every corner  crevice  going   thoroughly searched  wherever one wandered through  maze  passages lights    seen flitting hither  thither   distance  shoutings  pistolshots sent their hollow reverberations   ear down  sombre aisles in one place far   section usually traversed  tourists  names “becky  tom” had been found traced upon  rocky wall

because this one parted latest   living body before  awful death came some said  now  then   cave  faraway speck  light would glimmer  then  glorious shout would burst forth   score  men go trooping down  echoing aisle—and then  sickening disappointment always followed  children  not there   only  searcher’s light three dreadful days  nights dragged their tedious hours along   village sank into  hopeless stupor no one had heart  anything the accidental discovery just made   proprietor   temperance tavern kept liquor  his premises scarcely fluttered  public pulse tremendous   fact was in  lucid interval huck feebly led up   subject  taverns  finally asked—dimly dreading  worst—if anything had been discovered   temperance tavern since  had been ill “yes” said  widow huck started up  bed wildeyed “what what  it” “liquor—and  place  been shut up lie down child—what  turn you did give me” “only tell me just one thing—only just one—please was  tom sawyer  found it” the widow burst into tears “hush hush child hush i’ve told you before you must not talk you  very very sick” then nothing but liquor had been found there would have been  great powwow if  had been  gold so  treasure  gone forever—gone forever but what could she  crying about curious  she should cry these thoughts worked their dim way through huck’s mind  under  weariness they gave him  fell asleep the widow said  herself “there—he’s asleep poor wreck tom sawyer find it pity but somebody could find tom sawyer ah there ain’t many left now that’s got hope enough or strength enough either  go  searching” chapter xxxi now  return  tom  becky’s share   picnic they tripped along  murky aisles   rest   company visiting  familiar wonders   cave—wonders dubbed  rather overdescriptive names such  “the drawingroom” “the cathedral” “aladdin’s palace”  so on presently  hideandseek frolicking began  tom  becky engaged    zeal until  exertion began  grow  trifle wearisome then they wandered down  sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft  reading  tangled webwork  names dates postoffice addresses  mottoes  which  rocky walls had been frescoed in candlesmoke still drifting along  talking they scarcely noticed  they  now   part   cave whose walls  not frescoed they smoked their own names under  overhanging shelf  moved on presently they came   place where  little stream  water trickling over  ledge  carrying  limestone sediment  it had   slowdragging ages formed  laced  ruffled niagara  gleaming  imperishable stone tom squeezed his small body behind   order  illuminate   becky’s gratification he found   curtained  sort  steep natural stairway which  enclosed between narrow walls   once  ambition    discoverer seized him becky responded  his call  they made  smokemark  future guidance  started upon their quest they wound this way  that far down into  secret depths   cave made another mark  branched off  search  novelties  tell  upper world about in one place they found  spacious cavern  whose ceiling depended  multitude  shining stalactites   length  circumference   man’s leg they walked all about it wondering  admiring  presently left   one   numerous passages  opened into it this shortly brought them   bewitching spring whose basin  incrusted   frostwork  glittering crystals     midst   cavern whose walls  supported  many fantastic pillars which had been formed   joining  great stalactites  stalagmites together  result   ceaseless waterdrip  centuries under  roof vast knots  bats had packed themselves together thousands   bunch  lights disturbed  creatures  they came flocking down  hundreds squeaking  darting furiously   candles tom knew their ways   danger  this sort  conduct he seized becky’s hand  hurried her into  first corridor  offered  none too soon   bat struck becky’s light out   wing while she  passing out   cavern the bats chased  children  good distance but  fugitives plunged into every new passage  offered   last got rid   perilous things tom found  subterranean lake shortly which stretched  dim length away until  shape  lost   shadows he wanted  explore  borders but concluded   would  best  sit down  rest awhile first now   first time  deep stillness   place laid  clammy hand upon  spirits   children becky said “why i didn’t notice but  seems ever so long since i heard any   others” “come  think becky we  away down below them—and i don’t know how far away north or south or east or whichever  is we couldn’t hear them here” becky grew apprehensive “i wonder how long we’ve been down here tom we better start back” “yes i reckon we better p’raps we better” “can you find  way tom it’s all  mixedup crookedness  me” “i reckon i could find it—but then  bats if they put our candles out     awful fix let’s try some other way so  not  go through there” “well but i hope we won’t get lost it would  so awful”   girl shuddered   thought   dreadful possibilities they started through  corridor  traversed   silence  long way glancing  each new opening  see if there  anything familiar about  look  it but they  all strange every time tom made  examination becky would watch his face   encouraging sign   would say cheerily “oh it’s all right this ain’t  one but we’ll come   right away” but  felt less  less hopeful  each failure  presently began  turn off into diverging avenues  sheer random  desperate hope  finding  one   wanted he still said   “all right” but there  such  leaden dread  his heart   words had lost their ring  sounded just  if  had said “all  lost” becky clung  his side   anguish  fear  tried hard  keep back  tears but they would come at last she said “oh tom never mind  bats let’s go back  way we seem  get worse  worse off all  time” “listen” said he profound silence silence so deep  even their breathings  conspicuous   hush tom shouted the call went echoing down  empty aisles  died out   distance   faint sound  resembled  ripple  mocking laughter “oh don’t do  again tom   too horrid” said becky “it  horrid but i better becky they might hear us you know”   shouted again the “might”  even  chillier horror than  ghostly laughter  so confessed  perishing hope the children stood still  listened but there  no result tom turned upon  back track  once  hurried his steps it  but  little while before  certain indecision  his manner revealed another fearful fact  becky—he could not find his way back “oh tom you didn’t make any marks” “becky i  such  fool such  fool i never thought we might want  come back no—i can’t find  way it’s all mixed up” “tom tom we’re lost we’re lost we never can get out  this awful place oh why did we ever leave  others” she sank   ground  burst into such  frenzy  crying  tom  appalled   idea  she might die or lose her reason he sat down  her  put his arms around her she buried her face  his bosom she clung  him she poured out her terrors her unavailing regrets   far echoes turned them all  jeering laughter tom begged her  pluck up hope again  she said she could not he fell  blaming  abusing himself  getting her into this miserable situation this had  better effect she said she would try  hope again she would get up  follow wherever  might lead if only  would not talk like  any more for   no more  blame than she she said so they moved  again—aimlessly—simply  random—all they could do   move keep moving for  little while hope made  show  reviving—not  any reason  back it but only because    nature  revive when  spring  not been taken out    age  familiarity  failure byandby tom took becky’s candle  blew  out this economy meant so much words  not needed becky understood  her hope died again she knew  tom had  whole candle  three or four pieces  his pockets—yet  must economize byandby fatigue began  assert  claims  children tried  pay attention    dreadful  think  sitting down when time  grown   so precious moving  some direction  any direction   least progress  might bear fruit but  sit down   invite death  shorten  pursuit at last becky’s frail limbs refused  carry her farther she sat down tom rested  her  they talked  home   friends there   comfortable beds and above all  light becky cried  tom tried  think  some way  comforting her but all his encouragements  grown threadbare  use  sounded like sarcasms fatigue bore so heavily upon becky  she drowsed off  sleep tom  grateful he sat looking into her drawn face  saw  grow smooth  natural under  influence  pleasant dreams  byandby  smile dawned  rested there the peaceful face reflected somewhat  peace  healing into his own spirit  his thoughts wandered away  bygone times  dreamy memories while   deep  his musings becky woke up   breezy little laugh—but   stricken dead upon her lips   groan followed it “oh how could i sleep i wish i never never had waked no no i don’t tom don’t look so i won’t say  again” “i’m glad you’ve slept becky you’ll feel rested now  we’ll find  way out” “we can try tom but i’ve seen such  beautiful country  my dream i reckon we  going there” “maybe not maybe not cheer up becky  let’s go  trying” they rose up  wandered along hand  hand  hopeless they tried  estimate how long they had been   cave but all they knew    seemed days  weeks  yet   plain  this could not be  their candles  not gone yet a long time after this—they could not tell how long—tom said they must go softly  listen  dripping water—they must find  spring they found one presently  tom said   time  rest again both  cruelly tired yet becky said she thought she could go  little farther she  surprised  hear tom dissent she could not understand it they sat down  tom fastened his candle   wall  front  them  some clay thought  soon busy nothing  said  some time then becky broke  silence “tom i am so hungry” tom took something out  his pocket “do you remember this” said he becky almost smiled “it’s our weddingcake tom” “yes—i wish    big   barrel  it’s all we’ve got” “i saved    picnic  us  dream on tom  way grownup people do  weddingcake—but it’ll  our—” she dropped  sentence where  was tom divided  cake  becky ate  good appetite while tom nibbled  his moiety there  abundance  cold water  finish  feast with byandby becky suggested  they move  again tom  silent  moment then  said “becky can you bear  if i tell you something” becky’s face paled but she thought she could “well then becky we must stay here where there’s water  drink that little piece  our last candle” becky gave loose  tears  wailings tom did what  could  comfort her but  little effect at length becky said “tom” “well becky” “they’ll miss us  hunt  us” “yes they will certainly they will” “maybe they’re hunting  us now tom” “why i reckon maybe they are i hope they are” “when would they miss us tom” “when they get back   boat i reckon” “tom  might  dark then—would they notice we hadn’t come” “i don’t know but anyway your mother would miss you  soon  they got home” a frightened look  becky’s face brought tom  his senses   saw   had made  blunder becky  not  have gone home  night the children became silent  thoughtful in  moment  new burst  grief  becky showed tom   thing  his mind had struck hers also—that  sabbath morning might  half spent before mrs thatcher discovered  becky  not  mrs harper’s the children fastened their eyes upon their bit  candle  watched  melt slowly  pitilessly away saw  half inch  wick stand alone  last saw  feeble flame rise  fall climb  thin column  smoke linger   top  moment  then—the horror  utter darkness reigned how long afterward    becky came   slow consciousness  she  crying  tom’s arms neither could tell all  they knew was  after what seemed  mighty stretch  time both awoke out   dead stupor  sleep  resumed their miseries once more tom said  might  sunday now—maybe monday he tried  get becky  talk but her sorrows  too oppressive all her hopes  gone tom said  they must have been missed long ago  no doubt  search  going on he would shout  maybe some one would come he tried it but   darkness  distant echoes sounded so hideously   tried  no more the hours wasted away  hunger came  torment  captives again a portion  tom’s half   cake  left they divided  ate it but they seemed hungrier than before the poor morsel  food only whetted desire byandby tom said “sh did you hear that” both held their breath  listened there   sound like  faintest faroff shout instantly tom answered it  leading becky   hand started groping down  corridor   direction presently  listened again again  sound  heard  apparently  little nearer “it’s them” said tom “they’re coming come along becky—we’re all right now” the joy   prisoners  almost overwhelming their speed  slow however because pitfalls  somewhat common  had   guarded against they shortly came  one  had  stop it might  three feet deep  might   hundred—there  no passing   any rate tom got down  his breast  reached  far down   could no bottom they must stay there  wait until  searchers came they listened evidently  distant shoutings  growing more distant  moment or two more  they had gone altogether the heartsinking misery  it tom whooped until   hoarse but    no use he talked hopefully  becky but  age  anxious waiting passed  no sounds came again the children groped their way back   spring the weary time dragged on they slept again  awoke famished  woestricken tom believed  must  tuesday  this time now  idea struck him there  some

never told   tavernkeeper you know his tavern  all right  saturday i went   picnic don’t you remember you   watch there  night” “oh yes why  seems ’bout  year ago it   very night  i follered injun joe   widder’s” “you followed him” “yes—but you keep mum i reckon injun joe’s left friends behind him  i don’t want ’em souring  me  doing me mean tricks if  hadn’t ben  me he’d  down  texas now all right” then huck told his entire adventure  confidence  tom who had only heard   welshman’s part   before “well” said huck presently coming back   main question “whoever nipped  whiskey  no  nipped  money too i reckon—anyways it’s  goner  us tom” “huck  money wasn’t ever  no ” “what” huck searched his comrade’s face keenly “tom have you got   track   money again” “huck it’s   cave” huck’s eyes blazed “say  again tom” “the money’s   cave” “tom—honest injun now—is  fun or earnest” “earnest huck—just  earnest  ever i   my life will you go  there  me  help get  out” “i bet i will i  if it’s where we can blaze our way    not get lost” “huck we can do  without  least little bit  trouble   world” “good  wheat what makes you think  money’s—” “huck you just wait till we get  there if we don’t find  i’ll agree  give you my drum  every thing i’ve got   world i will  jings” “all right—it’s  whiz when do you say” “right now if you say it are you strong enough” “is  far   cave i ben  my pins  little three or four days now but i can’t walk more’n  mile tom—least i don’t think i could” “it’s about five mile into there  way anybody but me would go huck but there’s  mighty short cut  they don’t anybody but me know about huck i’ll take you right     skiff i’ll float  skiff down there  i’ll pull  back again all  myself you needn’t ever turn your hand over” “less start right off tom” “all right we want some bread  meat  our pipes   little bag or two  two or three kitestrings  some  these newfangled things they call lucifer matches i tell you many’s  time i wished i had some when i   there before” a trifle after noon  boys borrowed  small skiff   citizen who  absent  got under way  once when they  several miles below “cave hollow” tom said “now you see this bluff here looks all alike all  way down   cave hollow—no houses no woodyards bushes all alike but do you see  white place up yonder where there’s been  landslide well that’s one  my marks we’ll get ashore now” they landed “now huck where we’re astanding you could touch  hole i got out    fishingpole see if you can find it” huck searched all  place about  found nothing tom proudly marched into  thick clump  sumach bushes  said “here you are look  it huck it’s  snuggest hole  this country you just keep mum about it all along i’ve been wanting    robber but i knew i’d got  have  thing like this  where  run across    bother we’ve got  now  we’ll keep  quiet only we’ll let joe harper  ben rogers in—because  course there’s got    gang or else there wouldn’t  any style about it tom sawyer’s gang—it sounds splendid don’t it huck” “well  just does tom and who’ll we rob” “oh most anybody waylay people—that’s mostly  way” “and kill them” “no not always hive them   cave till they raise  ransom” “what’s  ransom” “money you make them raise all they can off’n their friends  after you’ve kept them  year if  ain’t raised then you kill them that’s  general way only you don’t kill  women you shut up  women but you don’t kill them they’re always beautiful  rich  awfully scared you take their watches  things but you always take your hat off  talk polite they ain’t anybody  polite  robbers—you’ll see   any book well  women get  loving you  after they’ve been   cave  week or two weeks they stop crying  after  you couldn’t get them  leave if you drove them out they’d turn right around  come back it’s so  all  books” “why it’s real bully tom i believe it’s better’n    pirate” “yes it’s better  some ways because it’s close  home  circuses  all that” by this time everything  ready   boys entered  hole tom   lead they toiled their way   farther end   tunnel then made their spliced kitestrings fast  moved on a few steps brought them   spring  tom felt  shudder quiver all through him he showed huck  fragment  candlewick perched   lump  clay against  wall  described how   becky had watched  flame struggle  expire the boys began  quiet down  whispers now   stillness  gloom   place oppressed their spirits they went on  presently entered  followed tom’s other corridor until they reached  “jumpingoff place” the candles revealed  fact    not really  precipice but only  steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high tom whispered “now i’ll show you something huck” he held his candle aloft  said “look  far around  corner  you can do you see that there—on  big rock over yonder—done  candlesmoke” “tom it’s  cross” “now where’s your number two ‘under  cross’ hey right yonder’s where i saw injun joe poke up his candle huck” huck stared   mystic sign awhile  then said   shaky voice “tom less git out  here” “what  leave  treasure” “yes—leave it injun joe’s ghost  round about there certain” “no  ain’t huck no  ain’t it would ha’nt  place where  died—away out   mouth   cave—five mile  here” “no tom  wouldn’t it would hang round  money i know  ways  ghosts  so do you” tom began  fear  huck  right misgivings gathered  his mind but presently  idea occurred  him— “lookyhere huck what fools we’re making  ourselves injun joe’s ghost ain’t  going  come around where there’s  cross” the point  well taken it had  effect “tom i didn’t think  that but that’s so it’s luck  us  cross is i reckon we’ll climb down there  have  hunt   box” tom went first cutting rude steps   clay hill   descended huck followed four avenues opened out   small cavern which  great rock stood in the boys examined three  them  no result they found  small recess   one nearest  base   rock   pallet  blankets spread down  it also  old suspender some bacon rind   wellgnawed bones  two or three fowls but there  no moneybox the lads searched  researched this place but  vain tom said “he said under  cross well this comes nearest  being under  cross it can’t  under  rock itself because  sets solid   ground” they searched everywhere once more  then sat down discouraged huck could suggest nothing byandby tom said “lookyhere huck there’s footprints  some candlegrease   clay about one side  this rock but not   other sides now what’s  for i bet you  money is under  rock i’m going  dig   clay” “that ain’t no bad notion tom” said huck  animation tom’s “real barlow”  out  once   had not dug four inches before  struck wood “hey huck—you hear that” huck began  dig  scratch now some boards  soon uncovered  removed they had concealed  natural chasm which led under  rock tom got into this  held his candle  far under  rock   could but said  could not see   end   rift he proposed  explore he stooped  passed under  narrow way descended gradually he followed  winding course first   right then   left huck  his heels tom turned  short curve byandby  exclaimed “my goodness huck lookyhere” it   treasurebox sure enough occupying  snug little cavern along   empty powderkeg  couple  guns  leather cases two or three pairs  old moccasins  leather belt  some other rubbish well soaked   waterdrip “got   last” said huck ploughing among  tarnished coins  his hand “my but we’re rich tom” “huck i always reckoned we’d get it it’s just too good  believe but we have got it sure say—let’s not fool around here let’s snake  out lemme see if i can lift  box” it weighed about fifty pounds tom could lift it after  awkward fashion but could not carry  conveniently “i thought so”  said “they carried  like   heavy  day   ha’nted house i noticed that i reckon i  right  think  fetching  little bags along” the money  soon   bags   boys took  up   cross rock “now less fetch  guns  things” said huck “no huck—leave them there they’re just  tricks  have when we go  robbing we’ll keep them there all  time  we’ll hold our orgies there too it’s  awful snug place  orgies” “what orgies” “i dono but robbers always have orgies   course we’ve got  have them too come along huck we’ve been  here  long time it’s getting late i reckon i’m hungry too we’ll eat  smoke when we get   skiff” they presently emerged into  clump  sumach bushes looked warily out found  coast clear   soon lunching  smoking   skiff as  sun dipped toward  horizon they pushed out  got under way tom skimmed up  shore through  long twilight chatting cheerily  huck  landed shortly after dark “now huck” said tom “we’ll hide  money   loft   widow’s woodshed  i’ll come up   morning  we’ll count   divide  then we’ll hunt up  place out   woods   where    safe just you lay quiet here  watch  stuff till i run  hook benny taylor’s little wagon i won’t  gone  minute” he disappeared  presently returned   wagon put  two small sacks into it threw some old rags  top  them  started off dragging his cargo behind him when  boys reached  welshman’s house they stopped  rest just  they  about  move on  welshman stepped out  said “hallo who’s that” “huck  tom sawyer” “good come along  me boys you  keeping everybody waiting here—hurry up trot ahead—i’ll haul  wagon  you why it’s not  light   might be got bricks  it—or old metal” “old metal” said tom “i judged so  boys  this town  take more trouble  fool away more time hunting up six bits’ worth  old iron  sell   foundry than they would  make twice  money  regular work but that’s human nature—hurry along hurry along” the boys wanted  know what  hurry  about “never mind you’ll see when we get   widow douglas’” huck said  some apprehension—for   long used  being falsely accused “mr jones we haven’t been doing nothing” the welshman laughed “well i don’t know huck my boy i don’t know about that ain’t you   widow good friends” “yes well she’s ben good friends  me anyway” “all right then what do you want   afraid for” this question  not entirely answered  huck’s slow mind before  found himself pushed along  tom into mrs douglas’ drawingroom mr jones left  wagon near  door  followed the place  grandly lighted  everybody    any consequence   village  there the thatchers  there  harpers  rogerses aunt polly sid mary  minister  editor   great many more  all dressed  their best the widow received  boys  heartily  any one could well receive two such looking beings they  covered  clay  candlegrease aunt polly blushed crimson  humiliation  frowned  shook her head  tom nobody suffered half  much   two boys did however mr jones said “tom wasn’t  home yet so i gave him up but i stumbled  him  huck right  my door  so i just brought them along   hurry” “and you did just right” said  widow “come  me boys” she took them   bedchamber  said “now wash  dress yourselves here  two new suits  clothes—shirts socks everything complete they’re huck’s—no no thanks huck—mr jones bought one  i  other but they’ll fit both  you get into them we’ll wait—come down when you  slicked up enough” then she left chapter xxxiv huck said “tom we can slope if we can find  rope the window ain’t high   ground” “shucks what do you want  slope for” “well i ain’t used   kind   crowd i can’t stand it i ain’t going down there tom” “oh bother it ain’t anything i don’t mind   bit i’ll take care  you” sid appeared “tom” said he “auntie  been waiting  you all  afternoon mary got your sunday clothes ready  everybody’s been fretting about you say—ain’t this grease  clay  your clothes” “now mr siddy you jist ’tend  your own business what’s all this blowout about anyway” “it’s one   widow’s parties  she’s always having this time it’s   welshman  his sons  account   scrape they helped her out   other night and say—i can tell you something if you want  know” “well what” “why old mr jones  going  try  spring something   people here tonight but i overheard him tell auntie today about it   secret but i reckon it’s not much   secret now everybody knows—the widow too  all she tries  let  she don’t mr jones  bound huck should  here—couldn’t get along  his grand secret without huck you know” “secret about what sid” “about huck tracking  robbers   widow’s i reckon mr jones  going  make  grand time over his surprise but i bet you   drop pretty flat” sid chuckled   very contented  satisfied way “sid   you  told” “oh never mind who  was somebody told—that’s enough” “sid there’s only one person  this town mean enough  do that  that’s you if you had been  huck’s place you’d ’a’ sneaked down  hill  never told anybody   robbers you can’t do any but mean things  you can’t bear  see anybody praised  doing good ones there—no thanks   widow says”—and tom cuffed sid’s ears  helped him   door  several kicks “now go  tell auntie if you dare—and tomorrow you’ll catch it” some minutes later  widow’s guests    suppertable   dozen children  propped up  little sidetables   same room after  fashion   country   day at  proper time mr jones made his little speech  which  thanked  widow   honor she  doing himself  his sons but said  there  another person whose modesty— and so forth  so on he sprung his secret about huck’s share   adventure   finest dramatic manner   master of but  surprise  occasioned  largely counterfeit  not  clamorous  effusive   might have been under happier circumstances however  widow made  pretty fair show  astonishment  heaped so many compliments  so much gratitude upon huck   almost forgot  nearly intolerable discomfort  his new clothes   entirely intolerable discomfort  being set up   target  everybody’s gaze  everybody’s laudations the widow said she meant  give huck  home under her roof  have him educated   when she could spare  money she would start him  business   modest way tom’s chance  come he said “huck don’t need it huck’s rich” nothing but  heavy strain upon  good manners   company kept back  due  proper complimentary laugh  this pleasant joke but  silence   little awkward tom broke it “huck’s got money maybe you don’t believe it but he’s got lots  it oh you needn’t smile—i reckon i can show you you just wait  minute” tom ran out  doors the company looked  each other   perplexed interest—and inquiringly  huck who  tonguetied “sid what ails tom” said aunt polly “he—well there ain’t ever any making   boy out i never—” tom entered struggling   weight  his sacks  aunt polly did not finish her sentence tom poured  mass  yellow coin upon  table  said “there—what did i tell you half  it’s huck’s  half  it’s mine” the spectacle took  general breath away all gazed nobody spoke   moment then there   unanimous call   explanation tom said  could furnish it   did the tale  long but brimful  interest there  scarcely  interruption  any one  break  charm   flow when  had finished mr jones said “i thought i had fixed up  little surprise  this occasion but  don’t amount  anything now this one makes  sing mighty small i’m willing  allow” the money  counted the sum amounted   little over twelve thousand dollars it  more than any one present had ever seen  one time before though several persons  there who  worth considerably more than   property chapter xxxv the reader may rest satisfied  tom’s  huck’s windfall made  mighty stir   poor little village  st petersburg so vast  sum all  actual cash seemed next  incredible it  talked about gloated over glorified until  reason  many   citizens tottered under  strain

men too some  them wherever tom  huck appeared they  courted admired stared at the boys  not able  remember  their remarks had possessed weight before but now their sayings  treasured  repeated

originality the village paper published biographical sketches   boys the widow douglas put huck’s money out  six per cent  judge thatcher did  same  tom’s  aunt polly’s request each lad had  income

school  boy  those old simple days—and clothe him  wash him too   matter judge thatcher had conceived  great opinion  tom he said  no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out   cave when

  fact    now under  widow douglas’ protection introduced him into society—no dragged him into it hurled him into it—and his sufferings  almost more than  could bear the widow’s servants kept him clean  neat combed  brushed  they bedded him nightly  unsympathetic sheets  had not one little spot or stain which  could press  his heart  know   friend he had  eat   knife  fork  had  use napkin cup  plate  had  learn his book  had  go  church  had  talk so properly  speech  become insipid  his mouth whithersoever  turned  bars  shackles  civilization shut him   bound him hand  foot he bravely bore his miseries three weeks  then one day turned up missing for fortyeight hours  widow hunted  him everywhere  great distress the public  profoundly concerned they searched high  low they dragged  river  his body early  third morning tom sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind  abandoned slaughterhouse   one  them  found  refugee huck had slept there  had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds  ends  food   lying off now  comfort  his pipe he  unkempt uncombed  clad   same old ruin  rags  had made him picturesque   days when   free  happy tom routed him out told him  trouble  had been causing  urged him  go home huck’s face lost  tranquil content  took  melancholy cast he said “don’t talk about it tom i’ve tried it   don’t work  don’t work tom it ain’t  me i ain’t used  it the widder’s good  me  friendly but i can’t stand them ways she makes me get up just   same time every morning she makes me wash they comb me all  thunder she won’t let me sleep

stretch nor scratch before folks—” then   spasm  special irritation  injury—“and dad fetch it she prayed all  time i never see such  woman i had  shove tom—i just had to and besides  school’s going  open  i’d  had  go  it—well i wouldn’t stand that tom lookyhere tom being rich ain’t what it’s cracked up  be it’s just worry  worry  sweat  sweat  awishing you  dead all  time now these clothes suits

sometimes—not many times becuz i don’t give  dern   thing ’thout it’s tollable hard  git—and you go  beg off  me   widder” “oh huck you know i can’t do that ’tain’t fair  besides if you’ll try this thing just  while longer you’ll come  like it” “like it yes—the way i’d like  hot stove if i   set   long enough no tom i won’t  rich  i won’t live  them cussed smothery houses i like  woods   river

ain’t going  keep me back  turning robber” “no oh goodlicks  you  real deadwood earnest tom” “just  dead earnest  i’m sitting here but huck we can’t let you into  gang if you ain’t respectable you know” huck’s joy  quenched “can’t let me in tom didn’t you let me go   pirate” “yes but that’s different a robber  more hightoned than what  pirate is—as  general thing in most countries they’re awful high up   nobility—dukes  such” “now tom hain’t you always ben friendly  me you wouldn’t shet me out would you tom you wouldn’t do that now would you tom” “huck i wouldn’t want to  i don’t want to—but what would people say why they’d say ‘mph tom sawyer’s gang pretty low characters  it’ they’d mean you huck you wouldn’t like that  i wouldn’t” huck  silent  some time engaged   mental struggle finally  said “well i’ll go back   widder   month  tackle   see if i can come  stand it if you’ll let me b’long   gang tom” “all right huck it’s  whiz come along old chap  i’ll ask  widow  let up  you
