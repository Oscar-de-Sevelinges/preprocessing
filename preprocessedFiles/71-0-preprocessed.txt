heartily accept  motto—“that government  best which governs least”  i should like  see  acted up  more rapidly  systematically carried out  finally amounts  this which also i believe—“that government  best which governs not  all”  when men  prepared  it     kind  government which they  have government   best but  expedient but most governments  usually  all governments  sometimes inexpedient the objections which have been brought against  standing army  they  many  weighty  deserve  prevail may also  last  brought against  standing government the standing army  only  arm   standing government the government itself which  only  mode which  people have chosen  execute their will  equally liable   abused  perverted before  people can act through it witness  present mexican war  work  comparatively  few individuals using  standing government  their tool for   outset  people would not have consented  this measure this american government—what   but  tradition though  recent one endeavoring  transmit itself unimpaired  posterity but each instant losing some   integrity it  not  vitality  force   single living man   single man can bend   his will it   sort  wooden gun   people themselves and if ever they should use   earnest   real one against each other   surely split but   not  less necessary  this   people must have some complicated machinery or other  hear  din  satisfy  idea  government which they have governments show thus how successfully men can  imposed on even impose  themselves  their own advantage it  excellent we must all allow yet this government never  itself furthered any enterprise but   alacrity  which  got out   way it does not keep  country free it does not settle  west it does not educate the character inherent   american people  done all   been accomplished   would have done somewhat more if  government had not sometimes got   way for government   expedient  which men would fain succeed  letting one another alone and   been said when   most expedient  governed  most let alone  it trade  commerce if they  not made  india rubber would never manage  bounce over obstacles which legislators  continually putting  their way and if one   judge these men wholly   effects  their actions  not partly  their intentions they would deserve   classed  punished  those mischievous persons who put obstructions   railroads but  speak practically    citizen unlike those who call themselves nogovernment men i ask for not  once no government but at once  better government let every man make known what kind  government would command his respect     one step toward obtaining it after all  practical reason why when  power  once   hands   people  majority  permitted    long period continue  rule  not because they  most likely     right nor because this seems fairest   minority but because they  physically  strongest but  government  which  majority rule  all cases can not  based  justice even  far  men understand it can there not   government  which  majorities do not virtually decide right  wrong but conscience—in which majorities decide only those questions  which  rule  expediency  applicable must  citizen ever   moment or   least degree resign his conscience   legislator why  every man  conscience then i think  we should  men first  subjects afterward it  not desirable  cultivate  respect   law so much    right the only obligation which i have  right  assume   do  any time what i think right it  truly enough said   corporation  no conscience but  corporation  conscientious men   corporation with  conscience law never made men  whit more just and  means  their respect  it even  welldisposed  daily made  agents  injustice a common  natural result   undue respect   law is  you may see  file  soldiers colonel captain corporal privates powdermonkeys  all marching  admirable order over hill  dale   wars against their wills aye against their common sense  consciences which makes  very steep marching indeed  produces  palpitation   heart they have no doubt     damnable business  which they  concerned they  all peaceably inclined now what  they men  all or small movable forts  magazines   service  some unscrupulous

one may say buried under arms  funeral accompaniment though  may  “not  drum  heard not  funeral note as his corpse   ramparts we hurried not  soldier discharged his farewell shot o’er  grave where our hero we buried” the mass  men serve  state thus not  men mainly but  machines  their bodies they   standing army   militia jailers constables posse comitatus c in most cases there  no free exercise whatever   judgment or   moral sense but they put themselves   level  wood  earth  stones  wooden men can perhaps  manufactured   serve  purpose  well such command no more respect than men  straw or  lump  dirt they have  same sort  worth only  horses  dogs yet such  these even  commonly esteemed good citizens others  most legislators politicians lawyers ministers  officeholders serve  state chiefly  their heads and  they rarely make any moral distinctions they   likely  serve  devil without intending it  god a very few  heroes patriots martyrs reformers   great sense  men serve  state  their consciences also  so necessarily resist    most part  they  commonly treated    enemies a wise man  only  useful   man   not submit   “clay”  “stop  hole  keep  wind away” but leave  office  his dust  least “i am too highborn   propertied to   secondary  control or useful servingman  instrument to any sovereign state throughout  world” he who gives himself entirely  his fellowmen appears  them useless  selfish but  who gives himself partially  them  pronounced  benefactor  philanthropist how does  become  man  behave toward  american government today i answer   cannot without disgrace  associated  it i cannot   instant recognize  political organization  my government which   slave’s government also all men recognize  right  revolution  is  right  refuse allegiance    resist  government when  tyranny or  inefficiency  great  unendurable but almost all say  such  not  case now but such   case they think   revolution  ’ if one   tell me  this   bad government because  taxed certain foreign commodities brought   ports   most probable  i should not make  ado about it  i can do without them all machines have their friction  possibly this does enough good  counterbalance  evil at any rate    great evil  make  stir about it but when  friction comes  have  machine  oppression  robbery  organized i say let us not have such  machine any longer in other words when  sixth   population   nation which  undertaken    refuge  liberty  slaves   whole country  unjustly overrun  conquered   foreign army  subjected  military law i think    not too soon  honest men  rebel  revolutionize what makes this duty  more urgent   fact   country so overrun  not our own but ours   invading army paley  common authority  many  moral questions  his chapter   “duty  submission  civil government” resolves all civil obligation into expediency   proceeds  say “that so long   interest   whole society requires it  is so long   established government cannot  resisted or changed without public inconveniency      god   established government  obeyed  no longer”—“this principle being admitted  justice  every particular case  resistance  reduced   computation   quantity   danger  grievance   one side    probability  expense  redressing    other” of this  says every man shall judge  himself but paley appears never  have contemplated those cases  which  rule  expediency does not apply  which  people  well   individual must do justice cost what  may if i have unjustly wrested  plank   drowning man i must restore   him though i drown myself this according  paley would  inconvenient but   would save his life  such  case shall lose it this people must cease  hold slaves   make war  mexico though  cost them their existence   people in their practice nations agree  paley but does anyone think  massachusetts does exactly what  right   present crisis “a drab  state  clotho’silver slut to have her train borne up  her soul trail   dirt” practically speaking  opponents   reform  massachusetts  not  hundred thousand politicians   south but  hundred thousand merchants  farmers here who  more interested  commerce  agriculture than they   humanity   not prepared  do justice   slave   mexico cost what  may i quarrel not  faroff foes but  those who near  home cooperate with  do  bidding  those far away  without whom  latter would  harmless we  accustomed  say   mass  men  unprepared but improvement  slow because  few  not materially wiser or better than  many it  not so important  many should   good  you   there  some absolute goodness somewhere    leaven  whole lump there  thousands who  in opinion opposed  slavery    war who yet  effect do nothing  put  end  them who esteeming themselves children  washington  franklin sit down  their hands  their pockets  say  they know not what  do  do nothing who even postpone  question  freedom   question  freetrade  quietly read  pricescurrent along   latest advices  mexico after dinner and  may be fall asleep over them both what   pricecurrent   honest man  patriot today they hesitate  they regret  sometimes they petition but they do nothing  earnest   effect they  wait well

one virtuous man but   easier  deal   real possessor   thing than   temporary guardian  it all voting   sort  gaming like chequers or backgammon   slight moral tinge  it  playing  right  wrong  moral questions  betting naturally accompanies it the character   voters  not staked i cast my vote perchance  i think right but i am not vitally concerned   right should prevail i am willing  leave    majority its obligation therefore never exceeds   expediency even voting for  right  doing nothing  it it  only expressing  men feebly your desire   should prevail a wise man  not leave  right   mercy  chance nor wish   prevail through  power   majority there  but little virtue   action  masses  men when  majority shall  length vote   abolition  slavery    because they  indifferent  slavery or because there  but little slavery left   abolished  their vote they  then   only slaves only his vote can hasten  abolition  slavery who asserts his own freedom  his vote i hear   convention   held  baltimore or elsewhere   selection   candidate   presidency made up chiefly  editors  men who  politicians  profession but i think what    any independent intelligent  respectable man what decision they may come to shall we not have  advantage  his wisdom  honesty nevertheless can we not count upon some independent votes are there not many individuals   country who do not attend conventions but no i find   respectable man so called  immediately drifted  his position  despairs  his country when his country  more reasons  despair  him he forthwith adopts one   candidates thus selected   only available one thus proving    himself available  any purposes   demagogue his vote   no more worth than   any unprincipled foreigner or hireling native who may have been bought oh   man who   man and  my neighbor says   bone  his back which you cannot pass your hand through our statistics   fault  population  been returned too large how many men  there   square thousand miles   country hardly one does not america offer any inducement  men  settle here the american  dwindled into  odd fellow—one who may  known   development  his organ  gregariousness   manifest lack  intellect  cheerful selfreliance whose first  chief concern  coming into  world   see   almshouses   good repair and before yet   lawfully donned  virile garb  collect  fund   support   widows  orphans  may be who  short

properly have other concerns  engage him but   his duty  least  wash his hands  it and if  gives  no thought longer not  give  practically his support if i devote myself  other pursuits  contemplations i must first see  least  i do not pursue them sitting upon another man’s shoulders i must get off him first   may pursue his contemplations too see what gross inconsistency  tolerated i have heard some  my townsmen say “i should like  have them order me out  help put down  insurrection   slaves or  march  mexico—see if i would go”  yet these very men have each directly  their allegiance  so indirectly  least  their money furnished  substitute the soldier  applauded who refuses  serve   unjust war  those who do not refuse  sustain  unjust government which makes  war  applauded  those whose own act  authority  disregards  sets  naught  if  state  penitent   degree   hired one  scourge  while  sinned but not   degree   left off sinning   moment thus under  name  order  civil government we  all made  last  pay homage   support our own meanness after  first blush  sin comes  indifference   immoral  becomes   were unmoral  not quite unnecessary   life which we have made the broadest  most prevalent error requires  most disinterested virtue  sustain it the slight reproach  which  virtue  patriotism  commonly liable  noble  most likely  incur those who while they disapprove   character  measures   government yield   their allegiance  support  undoubtedly  most conscientious supporters  so frequently  most serious obstacles  reform some  petitioning  state  dissolve  union  disregard  requisitions   president why do they not dissolve  themselves—the union between themselves   state—and refuse  pay their quota into  treasury do not they stand  same relation   state   state does   union and have not  same reasons prevented  state  resisting  union which have prevented them  resisting  state how can  man  satisfied  entertain  opinion merely  enjoy it is there any enjoyment  it if his opinion     aggrieved if you  cheated out   single dollar  your neighbor you do not rest satisfied  knowing you  cheated or  saying  you  cheated or even  petitioning him  pay you your due but you take effectual steps  once  obtain  full amount  see  you  never cheated again action  principle—the perception   performance  right—changes things  relations   essentially revolutionary  does not consist wholly  anything which was it not only divided states  churches  divides families aye  divides  individual separating  diabolical  him   divine unjust laws exist shall we  content  obey them or shall we endeavor  amend them  obey them until we have succeeded or shall we transgress them  once men generally under such  government  this think  they ought  wait until they have persuaded  majority  alter them they think that if they should resist  remedy would  worse than  evil but    fault   government itself   remedy is worse than  evil it makes  worse why   not more apt  anticipate  provide  reform why does  not cherish  wise minority why does  cry  resist before   hurt why does  not encourage  citizens     alert  point out  faults  do better than  would have them why does  always crucify christ  excommunicate copernicus  luther  pronounce washington  franklin rebels one would think   deliberate  practical denial   authority   only offence never contemplated  government else why   not assigned  definite  suitable  proportionate penalty if  man who  no property refuses but once  earn nine shillings   state   put  prison   period unlimited  any law  i know  determined only   discretion  those who placed him there but if  should steal ninety times nine shillings   state   soon permitted  go  large again if  injustice  part   necessary friction   machine  government let  go let  go perchance   wear smooth—certainly  machine  wear out if  injustice   spring or  pulley or  rope or  crank exclusively  itself then perhaps you may consider whether  remedy  not  worse than  evil but if    such  nature   requires you    agent  injustice  another then i say break  law let your life   counter friction  stop  machine what i have  do   see  any rate  i do not lend myself   wrong which i condemn as  adopting  ways which  state  provided  remedying  evil i know not  such ways they take too much time   man’s life   gone i have other affairs  attend to i came into this world not chiefly  make this  good place  live in but  live  it   good or bad a man  not every thing  do but something  because  cannot do every thing   not necessary   should do something wrong it  not my business   petitioning  governor or  legislature any more than   theirs  petition me and if they should not hear my petition what should i do then but  this case  state  provided no way  very constitution   evil this may seem   harsh  stubborn  unconcilliatory but    treat   utmost kindness  consideration  only spirit  can appreciate or deserves it so  all change   better like birth  death which convulse  body i do not hesitate  say  those who call themselves abolitionists should  once effectually withdraw their support both  person  property   government  massachusetts  not wait till they constitute  majority  one before they suffer  right  prevail through them i think    enough if they have god  their side without waiting   other one moreover any man more right than his neighbors constitutes  majority  one already i meet this american government or  representative  state government directly  face  face once  year no more   person   taxgatherer this   only mode  which  man situated  i am necessarily meets it   then says distinctly recognize me   simplest  most effectual and   present posture  affairs  indispensablest mode  treating    this head  expressing your little satisfaction   love  it   deny  then my civil neighbor  taxgatherer   very man i have  deal with—for  is after all  men  not  parchment  i quarrel—and   voluntarily chosen    agent   government how shall  ever know well what    does   officer   government or   man until   obliged  consider whether  shall treat me his neighbor  whom   respect   neighbor  welldisposed man or   maniac  disturber   peace  see if  can get over this obstruction  his neighborliness without  ruder  more impetuous thought or speech corresponding  his action i know this well  if one thousand if one hundred if ten men whom i could name—if ten honest men only—aye if one honest man  this state  massachusetts ceasing  hold slaves  actually  withdraw  this copartnership   locked up   county jail therefor  would   abolition  slavery  america for  matters not how small  beginning may seem  be what  once well done  done  ever but we love better  talk about it  we say  our mission reform keeps many scores  newspapers   service but not one man if my esteemed neighbor  state’s ambassador who  devote his days   settlement   question  human rights   council chamber instead  being threatened   prisons  carolina   sit down  prisoner  massachusetts  state which  so anxious  foist  sin  slavery upon her sister—though  present she can discover only  act  inhospitality    ground   quarrel  her—the legislature would not wholly waive  subject   following winter under  government which imprisons any unjustly  true place   just man  also  prison the proper place today  only place which massachusetts  provided  her freer  less desponding spirits   her prisons   put out  locked out   state  her own act  they have already put themselves out  their principles it  there   fugitive slave   mexican prisoner  parole   indian come  plead  wrongs  his race should find them   separate but more free  honorable ground where  state places those who  not with her but against her—the only house   slavestate  which  free man can abide  honor if any think  their influence would  lost there  their voices no longer afflict  ear   state  they would not    enemy within  walls they do not know  how much truth  stronger than error nor how much more eloquently  effectively  can combat injustice who  experienced  little  his own person cast your whole vote not  strip  paper merely but your whole influence a minority  powerless while  conforms   majority   not even  minority then but   irresistible when  clogs   whole weight if  alternative   keep all just men  prison or give up war  slavery  state  not hesitate which  choose if  thousand men  not  pay their taxbills this year  would not   violent  bloody measure   would   pay them  enable  state  commit violence  shed innocent blood this is  fact  definition   peaceable revolution if any such  possible if  taxgatherer or any other public officer asks me  one  done “but what shall i do” my answer is “if you really wish  do any thing resign your office” when  subject  refused allegiance   officer  resigned his office then  revolution  accomplished but even suppose blood should flow is there not  sort  blood shed when  conscience  wounded through this wound  man’s real manhood  immortality flow out   bleeds   everlasting death i see this blood flowing now i have contemplated  imprisonment   offender rather than  seizure  his goods—though both  serve  same purpose—because they who assert  purest right  consequently  most dangerous   corrupt state commonly have not spent much time  accumulating property to such  state renders comparatively small service   slight tax  wont  appear exorbitant particularly if they  obliged  earn   special labor  their hands if there  one who lived wholly without  use  money  state itself would hesitate  demand   him but  rich man—not  make any invidious comparison—is always sold   institution which makes him rich absolutely speaking  more money  less virtue  money comes between  man  his objects  obtains them  him   certainly no great virtue  obtain it it puts  rest many questions which  would otherwise  taxed  answer while  only new question which  puts   hard but superfluous one how  spend it thus his moral ground  taken  under his feet the opportunities  living  diminished  proportion  what  called  “means”  increased the best thing  man can do  his culture when   rich   endeavor  carry out those schemes which  entertained when   poor christ answered  herodians according  their condition “show me  tributemoney” said he—and one took  penny out  his pocket—if you use money which   image  cæsar  it  which   made current  valuable  is if you  men   state  gladly enjoy  advantages  cæsar’s government then pay him back some  his own when  demands it “render therefore  cæsar  which  cæsar’s   god those things which  god’s”—leaving them no wiser than before   which  which  they did not wish  know when i converse   freest  my neighbors i perceive that whatever they may say about  magnitude  seriousness   question  their regard   public tranquillity  long   short   matter is  they cannot spare  protection   existing government  they dread  consequences  disobedience    their property  families for my own part i should not like  think  i ever rely   protection   state but if i deny  authority   state when  presents  taxbill   soon take  waste all my property  so harass me  my children without end this  hard this makes  impossible   man  live honestly    same time comfortably  outward respects it  not  worth  while  accumulate property  would  sure  go again you must hire or squat somewhere  raise but  small crop  eat  soon you must live within yourself  depend upon yourself always tucked up  ready   start  not have many affairs a man may grow rich  turkey even if     all respects  good subject   turkish government confucius said—“if  state  governed   principles  reason poverty  misery  subjects  shame if  state  not governed   principles  reason riches  honors   subjects  shame” no until i want  protection  massachusetts   extended  me  some distant southern port where my liberty  endangered or until i am bent solely  building up  estate  home  peaceful enterprise i can afford  refuse allegiance  massachusetts  her right  my property  life it costs me less  every sense  incur  penalty  disobedience   state than  would  obey i should feel  if i  worth less   case some years ago  state met me  behalf   church  commanded me  pay  certain sum toward  support   clergyman whose preaching my father attended but never i myself “pay it”  said “or  locked up   jail” i declined  pay but unfortunately another man saw fit  pay it i did not see why  schoolmaster should  taxed  support  priest  not  priest  schoolmaster  i  not  state’s schoolmaster but i supported myself  voluntary subscription i did not see why  lyceum should not present  taxbill  have  state  back  demand  well   church however   request   selectmen i condescended  make some such statement  this  writing—“know all men  these presents  i henry thoreau do not wish   regarded   member  any incorporated society which i have not joined” this i gave   townclerk    it the state having thus learned  i did not wish   regarded   member   church  never made  like demand  me since though  said   must adhere   original presumption  time if i had known how  name them i should then have signed off  detail  all  societies which i never signed  to but i did not know where  find such  complete list i have paid no polltax  six years i  put into  jail once  this account  one night and  i stood considering  walls  solid stone two or three feet thick  door  wood  iron  foot thick   iron grating which strained  light i could not help being struck   foolishness   institution which treated me  if i  mere flesh  blood  bones   locked up i wondered   should have concluded  length  this   best use  could put me to  had never thought  avail itself  my services  some way i saw that if there   wall  stone between me  my townsmen there   still more difficult one  climb or break through before they could get    free  i was i did nor   moment feel confined   walls seemed  great waste  stone  mortar i felt  if i alone  all my townsmen had paid my tax they plainly did not know how  treat me but behaved like persons who  underbred in every threat   every compliment there   blunder  they thought  my chief desire   stand  other side   stone wall i could not but smile  see how industriously they locked  door  my meditations which followed them out again without let or hindrance  they  really all   dangerous as they could not reach me they had resolved  punish my body just  boys if they cannot come  some person against whom they have  spite  abuse his dog i saw   state  halfwitted    timid   lone woman  her silver spoons    did not know  friends   foes  i lost all my remaining respect  it  pitied it thus  state never intentionally confronts  man’s sense intellectual or moral but only his body his senses it  not armed  superior wit or honesty but  superior physical strength i  not born   forced i  breathe after my own fashion let us see who   strongest what force   multitude they only can force me who obey  higher law than i they force me  become like themselves i do not hear  men being forced  live this way or   masses  men what sort  life    live when i meet  government which says  me “your money or your life” why should i   haste  give  my money it may    great strait  not know what  do i cannot help that it must help itself do  i do it  not worth  while  snivel about it i am not responsible   successful working   machinery  society i am not  son   engineer i perceive that when  acorn   chestnut fall side  side  one does not remain inert  make way   other but both obey their own laws  spring  grow  flourish  best they can till one perchance overshadows  destroys  other if  plant cannot live according   nature  dies  so  man the night  prison  novel  interesting enough the prisoners  their shirtsleeves  enjoying  chat   evening air   doorway when i entered but  jailer said “come boys   time  lock up”  so they dispersed  i heard  sound  their steps returning into  hollow apartments my roommate  introduced  me   jailer  “a firstrate fellow   clever man” when  door  locked  showed me where  hang my hat  how  managed matters there the rooms  whitewashed once  month  this one  least   whitest most simply furnished  probably  neatest apartment  town he naturally wanted  know where i came from  what brought me there and when i had told him i asked him  my turn how  came there presuming him    honest man  course and   world goes i believe  was “why” said he “they accuse me  burning  barn but i never did it” as near  i could discover  had probably gone  bed   barn when drunk  smoked his pipe there  so  barn  burnt he had  reputation  being  clever man had been there some three months waiting  his trial  come on  would have  wait  much longer but   quite domesticated  contented since  got his board  nothing  thought    well treated he occupied one window  i  other  i saw that if one stayed there long his principal business would   look out  window i had soon read all  tracts   left there  examined where former prisoners had broken out  where  grate had been sawed off  heard  history   various occupants   room  i found  even here there   history   gossip which never circulated beyond  walls   jail probably this   only house   town where verses  composed which  afterward printed   circular form but not published i  shown quite  long list  verses which  composed  some young men who had been detected   attempt  escape who avenged themselves  singing them i pumped my fellowprisoner  dry  i could  fear i should never see him again but  length  showed me which  my bed  left me  blow out  lamp it  like travelling into  far country such  i had never expected  behold  lie there  one night it seemed  me  i never had heard  townclock strike before nor  evening sounds   village  we slept   windows open which  inside  grating it   see my native village   light   middle ages  our concord  turned into  rhine stream  visions  knights  castles passed before me they   voices  old burghers  i heard   streets i   involuntary spectator  auditor  whatever  done  said   kitchen   adjacent villageinn—a wholly new  rare experience  me it   closer view  my native town i  fairly inside  it i never had seen  institutions before this  one   peculiar institutions     shire town i began  comprehend what  inhabitants  about in  morning our breakfasts  put through  hole   door  small oblongsquare tin pans made  fit  holding  pint  chocolate  brown bread   iron spoon when they called   vessels again i  green enough  return what bread i had left but my comrade seized it  said  i should lay  up  lunch or dinner soon after   let out  work  haying   neighboring field whither  went every day  would not  back till noon so  bade me goodday saying   doubted if  should see me again when i came out  prison—for some one interfered  paid  tax—i did not perceive  great changes had taken place   common such   observed who went   youth  emerged  grayheaded man  yet  change had  my eyes come over  scene—the town  state  country—greater than any  mere time could effect i saw yet more distinctly  state  which i lived i saw  what extent  people among whom i lived could  trusted  good neighbors  friends  their friendship   summer weather only  they did not greatly purpose  do right  they   distinct race  me  their prejudices  superstitions   chinamen  malays are that  their sacrifices  humanity they ran no risks not even  their property that after all they  not so noble but they treated  thief   had treated them  hoped   certain outward observance   few prayers   walking   particular straight though useless path  time  time  save their souls this may   judge my neighbors harshly  i believe  most  them  not aware  they have such  institution   jail  their village it  formerly  custom  our village when  poor debtor came out  jail  his acquaintances  salute him looking through their fingers which  crossed  represent  grating   jail window “how do ye do” my neighbors did not thus salute me but first looked  me  then  one another  if i had returned   long journey i  put into jail  i  going   shoemaker’s  get  shoe which  mended when i  let out  next morning i proceeded  finish my errand and having put  my mended shoe joined  huckleberry party who  impatient  put themselves under my conduct   half  hour—for  horse  soon tackled—was   midst   huckleberry field  one  our highest hills two miles off  then  state  nowhere   seen this   whole history  “my prisons” i have never declined paying  highway tax because i am  desirous  being  good neighbor  i am  being  bad subject and   supporting schools i am doing my part  educate my fellowcountrymen now it   no particular item   taxbill  i refuse  pay it i simply wish  refuse allegiance   state  withdraw  stand aloof   effectually i do not care  trace  course  my dollar if i could till  buys  man or  musket  shoot one with—the dollar  innocent—but i am concerned  trace  effects  my allegiance in fact i quietly declare war   state after my fashion though i  still make use  get what advantages  her i can   usual  such cases if others pay  tax which  demanded  me   sympathy   state they do but what they have already done  their own case or rather they abet injustice   greater extent than  state requires if they pay  tax   mistaken interest   individual taxed  save his property or prevent his going  jail   because they have not considered wisely how far they let their private feelings interfere   public good this then  my position  present but one cannot  too much  his guard  such  case lest his actions  biassed  obstinacy or  undue regard   opinions  men let him see   does only what belongs  himself    hour i think sometimes why this people mean well they  only ignorant they would do better if they knew how why give your neighbors this pain  treat you  they  not inclined to but i think again this  no reason why i should do  they do or permit others  suffer much greater pain   different kind again i sometimes say  myself when many millions  men without heat without illwill without personal feeling  any kind demand  you  few shillings only without  possibility such  their constitution  retracting or altering their present demand  without  possibility  your side  appeal  any other millions why expose yourself  this overwhelming brute force you do not resist cold  hunger  winds   waves thus obstinately you quietly submit   thousand similar necessities you do not put your head into  fire but just  proportion  i regard this  not wholly  brute force but partly  human force  consider  i have relations  those millions   so many millions  men  not  mere brute or inanimate things i see  appeal  possible first  instantaneously  them   maker  them and secondly  them  themselves but if i put my head deliberately into  fire there  no appeal  fire or   maker  fire  i have only myself  blame if i could convince myself  i have any right   satisfied  men  they are   treat them accordingly  not according  some respects  my requisitions  expectations  what they  i ought  be then like  good mussulman  fatalist i should endeavor   satisfied  things  they are  say      god and above all there  this difference between resisting this   purely brute or natural force  i can resist this  some effect but i cannot expect like orpheus  change  nature   rocks  trees  beasts i do not wish  quarrel  any man or nation i do not wish  split hairs  make fine distinctions or set myself up  better than my neighbors i seek rather i may say even  excuse  conforming   laws   land i am but too ready  conform  them indeed i have reason  suspect myself  this head  each year   taxgatherer comes round i find myself disposed  review  acts  position   general  state governments   spirit   people  discover  pretext  conformity “we must affect our country  our parents and if  any time we alienate out love  industry  doing  honor we must respect effects  teach  soul matter  conscience  religion and not desire  rule or benefit” i believe   state  soon  able  take all my work  this sort out  my hands  then i shall  no better patriot than my fellowcountrymen seen   lower point  view  constitution  all  faults  very good  law   courts  very respectable even this state  this american government are  many respects very admirable  rare things   thankful for such   great many have described them seen   higher still   highest who shall say what they are or  they  worth looking  or thinking   all however  government does not concern me much  i shall bestow  fewest possible thoughts  it it  not many moments  i live under  government even  this world if  man  thoughtfree fancyfree imaginationfree  which is not never   long time appearing to be  him unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally interrupt him i know  most men think differently  myself but those whose lives   profession devoted   study  these or kindred subjects content me  little  any statesmen  legislators standing so completely within  institution never distinctly  nakedly behold it they speak  moving society but have no restingplace without it they may  men   certain experience  discrimination  have no doubt invented ingenious  even useful systems  which we sincerely thank them but all their wit  usefulness lie within certain not very wide limits they  wont  forget   world  not governed  policy  expediency webster never goes behind government  so cannot speak  authority about it his words  wisdom  those legislators who contemplate no essential reform   existing government but  thinkers  those who legislate  all time  never once glances   subject i know  those whose serene  wise speculations  this theme would soon reveal  limits  his mind’s range  hospitality yet compared   cheap professions  most reformers   still cheaper wisdom  eloquence  politicians  general his  almost  only sensible  valuable words  we thank heaven  him comparatively   always strong original and above all practical still his quality  not wisdom but prudence the lawyer’s truth  not truth but consistency or  consistent expediency truth  always  harmony  herself   not concerned chiefly  reveal  justice  may consist  wrongdoing he well deserves   called    been called  defender   constitution there  really no blows   given  him but defensive ones he  not  leader but  follower his leaders   men  ’ “i have never made  effort”  says “and never propose  make  effort i have never countenanced  effort  never mean  countenance  effort  disturb  arrangement  originally made  which  various states came into  union” still thinking   sanction which  constitution gives  slavery  says “because   part   original compact—let  stand” notwithstanding his special acuteness  ability   unable  take  fact out   merely political relations  behold    lies absolutely   disposed    intellect—what  instance  behoves  man  do here  america today  regard  slavery but ventures or  driven  make some such desperate answer   following while professing  speak absolutely    private man—from which what new  singular code  social duties might  inferred—“the manner” says he “in which  governments  those states where slavery exists   regulate it   their own consideration under  responsibility  their constituents   general laws  propriety humanity  justice   god associations formed elsewhere springing   feeling  humanity or any other cause have nothing whatever  do  it they have never received any encouragement  me  they never will” these extracts have been inserted since  lecture  read —hdt they who know  no purer sources  truth who have traced up  stream no higher stand  wisely stand   bible   constitution  drink   there  reverence  humanity but they who behold where  comes trickling into this lake or  pool gird up their loins once more  continue their pilgrimage toward  fountainhead no man   genius  legislation  appeared  america they  rare   history   world there  orators politicians  eloquent men   thousand but  speaker  not yet opened his mouth  speak who  capable  settling  muchvexed questions   day we love eloquence   own sake  not  any truth which  may utter or any heroism  may inspire our legislators have not yet learned  comparative value  freetrade   freedom  union   rectitude   nation they have no genius or talent  comparatively humble questions  taxation  finance commerce  manufactures  agriculture if we  left solely   wordy wit  legislators  congress  our guidance uncorrected   seasonable experience   effectual complaints   people america would not long retain her rank among  nations for eighteen hundred years though perchance i have no right  say it  new testament  been written yet where   legislator who  wisdom  practical talent enough  avail himself   light which  sheds   science  legislation the authority  government even such  i am willing  submit to—for i  cheerfully obey those who know  can do better than i   many things even those who neither know nor can do so well—is still  impure one   strictly just  must have  sanction  consent   governed it can have no pure right over my person  property but what i concede  it the progress   absolute   limited monarchy   limited monarchy   democracy   progress toward  true respect   individual even  chinese philosopher  wise enough  regard  individual   basis   empire is  democracy such  we know it  last improvement possible  government is  not possible  take  step further towards recognizing  organizing  rights  man there  never   really free  enlightened state until  state comes  recognize  individual   higher  independent power
